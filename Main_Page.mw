OpenMoko is an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source Open Source] project to create the world's first free mobile phone operating system.

The [[OpenMoko]] project is a community that anyone can join, to help design their ideal phone.

Eventually, phone software won't be tied to any particular phone. You can install any OpenMoko software over the whole range of [[Supported Hardware|supported phones]], and if you upgrade your phone, you don't lose that software. Bugs fixed on any phone are fixed on all. 

'''Currently it is not suitable for users.''' The state of the software at the moment is pre-alpha. If you order a Neo1973, DO NOT expect to be able to use it as an everyday phone for several months.

The [[Neo1973]] from [[FIC]] is the first of many phones that OpenMoko will run on; indeed, some people erroneously use the terms Neo1973 and OpenMoko as interchangeable. If you are willing to have the alpha test experience, you can order Neo1973 hardware now from the [https://direct.openmoko.com/ Openmoko Online Shop]. You may wish to see the [[SH1 FAQ|Shipment 1 FAQ]].

Please join us in collaborating on the OpenMoko project through any of the [[Development resources | project resources]] including this OpenMoko wiki. Please see the [[Help:Contents | wiki editing help]] page for information on making contributions to this wiki. A [[Meet the Core Team | core team]] of developers funded by FIC, Inc. leads the project.

An [[introduction]] page is available, with [[Introduction#Photos|photos]] and [[Introduction#Videos|videos]]. Moreover, the usual [[FAQ | Frequently Asked Questions]] (FAQ) page might be helpful. Developers may find the [[ChangeLog | change log]] an important resource.

Update 2007-07-25:  The [http://forums.makeopensource.com/ Unofficial OpenMoko Forums] are now open!  Everyone is invited to participate!


The members of the OpenMoko community would like to thank FIC Inc. for showing leadership and initiating the OpenMoko project.
