'''Openmoko™''' is a project dedicated to delivering mobile phones with an open source software stack. Openmoko was earlier more directly associated with Openmoko Inc, but is nowadays a gathering of people with the shared goal of Free The Phone. Distributors are currently selling updated versions of the Openmoko Inc's phone released in 2008, [[Neo FreeRunner]], to advanced users, while the software stack for FreeRunner and future free phones is being developed by the community. Information about a [[GTA04|modern 3.5G / OMAP3 upgrade to FreeRunner and an upgraded OpenPhoenux aka GTA04 Complete are here]].
