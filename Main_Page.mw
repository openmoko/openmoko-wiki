Openmoko™ is a project dedicated to delivering mobile phones with an [[Source Code|open source software stack]]. Openmoko is currently selling the [[Neo FreeRunner]] phone to advanced users and will start selling it to the general public as soon as the software is more developed.

The Openmoko stack, which includes a full [[X server]], allows users and developers to transform mobile hardware platforms into unique products. Our license gives developers the freedom to cosmetically customize their device or radically remix it; change the wallpaper or rebuild the entire house! It grants them the freedom, for example, to transform a phone into a medical device or point of sale device or the freedom to simply install their own favorite software. Beyond freeing the software on our devices we have also released our [http://downloads.openmoko.org/CAD/ CAD] files. And at LinuxWorld 2008, we announced the release of the [http://downloads.openmoko.org/schematics/ schematics for our products].
