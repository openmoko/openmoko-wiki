Openmoko&trade; is an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source Open Source] project under[[License| GPL and LGPL license]]. The aim of Openmoko is to build the world's first free mobile platform which runs a full X server and can therefore run most X applications.  You can install any [[OpenMoko]] software over the whole range of [[OpenMoko-supported hardware|supported phones]], and if you upgrade your phone, you won't lose that software. Bugs fixed on any phone are fixed on all. 

The [[Neo1973 | Neo 1973 (GTA01)]] from [[FIC]] is the first of many phones that Openmoko may be used on.  You can go to  [https://direct.openmoko.com/ Openmoko Online Shop] to get the sales informaiton.  [[Neo FreeRunner  | Neo FreeRunner (GTA02)]] the new generation Openmoko mobile phone is not yet available - press [[Neo FreeRunner GTA02 Hardware| here]] to get more hardware information.   Otherwise, scroll down this page for info on the development status , or you can add your nickname to those interested buying the Neo FreeRunner [[Buying_Interest_List|here]].

The [[OpenMoko]] project is a community that anyone can join, to help design their ideal phone. Please join us in collaborating on the Openmoko project through any of the [[Development resources | project resources]] including this Openmoko wiki. Please see the [[Help:Contents | wiki editing help]] page for information on making contributions to this wiki. A [[Meet the Core Team | core team]] of developers funded by FIC, Inc. leads the project.

To the novice,  can start by use  [[introduction]] page ,  [[Introduction#Photos|photos]],  [[Introduction#Videos|videos]]  and [[OPENMOKO WIKI Official Index Page | Openmoko Official Index Page]] ,  to take the overview of Openmoko and  wiki.      Moreover, the usual [[FAQ | Frequently Asked Questions]] (FAQ)  and [http://lists.openmoko.org/mailman/listinfo/| mailing list] pages might be helpful. Developers may find the [[ChangeLog | change log]] an important resource.  

{{warning|'''The OpenMoko GUI applications are not suitable for end users yet.''' They are still in beta. Do not expect to always and reliably make and receive calls from the OpenMoko GUI. Thanks to the openness of the FIC Neo1973 hardware, there is also an alternative to the OpenMoko GUI: Qtopia 4.3.x is released under GPL and is at the edge of being usable for phone use.}}

* The latest Qtopia snapshot can now be successfully used to make and receive calls, to send and receive SMS and use Contacts for both. However, if you do not enable suspend, one battery will only last 3-5 hours, but in suspend, incoming calls do not wake up Qtopia! See [[Qtopia on Neo 1973]] for instructions.
