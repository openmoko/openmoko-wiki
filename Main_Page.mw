[[OpenMoko]] is an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source Open Source] project to create the world's first free mobile phone operating system.

The [[OpenMoko]] project is a community that anyone can join, to help design their ideal phone.

The long term goal is that phone software won't be tied to a phone. You can install any OpenMoko software over the whole range of phones, and if you upgrade your phone, you don't lose the software. Bugs fixed on one phone are fixed on all.

The [[Neo1973]] from [[FIC]] is the first of many phones that [[OpenMoko]] will run on.

Please join us in collaborating on the [[OpenMoko | OpenMoko project]] through any of the [[Development resources | project resources]] including the [[Main Page | OpenMoko wiki]]. Please see the [[Help:Contents | wiki editing help page]] for information on making contributions to this wiki.  A [[Meet the Core Team | core team of developers funded by FIC, Inc.]] leads the project.

An [[Introduction | introduction page]] is available.  The [[Introduction | page]] has both [[Introduction#Photos|photos]] and [[Introduction#Videos|videos]] available.  Moreover, the usual [[FAQ | Frequently Asked Questions, FAQ, page]] might be helpful.  Developers may find the [[ChangeLog | daily software change log]] an important resource.

The members of the [[OpenMoko]] community would like to thank [[FIC|FIC Inc.]] for showing leadership and initiating the [[OpenMoko]] project.
