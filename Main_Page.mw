<big>'''Welcome to the OpenMoko public Wiki'''</big>

This is to be the evolving, definitive resource on [[Neo1973]] development -- the GSM+[[Hardware:AGPS|AGPS]] Smartphone running [[OpenMoko]].  The intention is to collaboratively improve and update all information on this site.

** [[Development resources#Wiki|Wiki]]
** [[Development resources#Bugzilla|Bugzilla]]
** [[Development resources#IRC|IRC]]
** [[Development resources#SVN|svn + svnweb]]
