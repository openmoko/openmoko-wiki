[[Image:GTA02.gif |200px|right|frontside]]
OpenMoko&trade; is an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source Open Source] project to create the world's first free mobile phone operating system which runs a full X server and can therefore run most X applications.  The [[OpenMoko]] project is a community that anyone can join, to help design their ideal phone.

You can install any [[OpenMoko]] software over the whole range of [[OpenMoko-supported hardware|supported phones]], and if you upgrade your phone, you won't lose that software. Bugs fixed on any phone are fixed on all. 

The [[Neo1973 | Neo 1973 (GTA01)]] from [[FIC]] is the first of many phones that OpenMoko may be used on and has now sold out (Feb 11 2008) as can be seen here - [https://direct.openmoko.com/ Openmoko Online Shop].   

The [[Neo FreeRunner  | Neo FreeRunner (GTA02)]] is not yet available - see further down this page for info on the development status and further information.  You can add your nickname to those interested buying the Neo FreeRunner [[Buying_Interest_List|here]].

Please join us in collaborating on the OpenMoko project through any of the [[Development resources | project resources]] including this OpenMoko wiki. Please see the [[Help:Contents | wiki editing help]] page for information on making contributions to this wiki. A [[Meet the Core Team | core team]] of developers funded by FIC, Inc. leads the project.

An [[introduction]] page and [[OPENMOKO WIKI Official Index Page |index page]] is available, with [[Introduction#Photos|photos]],  [[Introduction#Videos|videos]] and index of wiki .   Moreover, the usual [[FAQ | Frequently Asked Questions]] (FAQ)  and  [[OPENMOKO WIKI Official Index Page |index page]] pages might be helpful. Developers may find the [[ChangeLog | change log]] an important resource.  

{{warning|'''The OpenMoko GUI applications are not suitable for end users yet.''' They are still in beta. Do not expect to always and reliably make and receive calls from the OpenMoko GUI. Thanks to the openness of the FIC Neo1973 hardware, there is also an alternative to the OpenMoko GUI: Qtopia 4.3.x is released under GPL and is at the edge of being usable for phone use.}}

'''OpenMoko Open Source Engineering and Schedule Policy'''
As an extension of the Open Source attitude towards source code, OpenMoko attempts to be open about as much of the engineering process as possible. Obviously this is not always possible, and because this is a fairly new notion, we are still learning how to do this properly. Our current policy is to attempt to tell you as much as possible about what we are doing, but never to attempt any schedule prediction. This is not due to secrecy, but rather is due to the large number of dependencies that are out of our control. For the latest status updates, see [[Community_Updates|Community Updates]]

'''FUTURE MODELS DEVELOPMENT STATUS''' 
[[Neo FreeRunner]] is still under development, and we are still testing the hardware. Since this is happening at the kernel and driver level, progress can be monitored on the openmoko-kernel mailing list, which is public. Once we complete this we will build a few more for further testing within the company. If this testing is successful, then we will start manufacturing units for sale. For the latest status updates, see [[Community_Updates|Community Updates]]

Status on the U-Boot and Kernel side can be found at [[Kernel-dev-status|Kernel-dev-status]].

* The latest Qtopia snapshot can now be successfully used to make and receive calls, to send and receive SMS and use Contacts for both. However, if you do not enable suspend, one battery will only last 3-5 hours, but in suspend, incoming calls do not wake up Qtopia! See [[Qtopia on Neo 1973]] for instructions.
