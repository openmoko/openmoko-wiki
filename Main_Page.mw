[[Image:FIC-neo1973_small.jpg|200px|right|frontside]]
OpenMoko&trade; is an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source Open Source] project to create the world's first free mobile phone operating system.

The [[OpenMoko]] project is a community that anyone can join, to help design their ideal phone.

Eventually, phone software won't be tied to any particular phone.

You can install any OpenMoko software over the whole range of [[Supported Hardware|supported phones]], and if you upgrade your phone, you don't lose that software. Bugs fixed on any phone are fixed on all. 

'''The software is not yet suitable for end-users.''' It is of alpha-quality, and much functionality which expected to be present in a phone is not ready for an end-user yet. That means that even the most critical phone uses like making/receiving calls and SMS, using contacts and a calendar, are not there yet or are not finished yet. If you order a Neo1973, DO NOT expect to be able to use it as an everyday phone until December 2007 at the soonest, and probably later.

Latest developments:
* The Openmoko snapshot from [[Phase_1_Software_Testing#Official_20071113_rootfs_with_20071113_.28r3238.29_kernel|20071113]], when employing a few steps, can be used to make and receive calls, but this has seen very little testing! Please also note that there is graphical frontend for sending/receiving of SMS included. With additional software, it is possible to send SMS.
* With some work, and only for 3-5 hours due to issues with suspend, it is now also also possible to use the Qtopia to make and receive calls, use contacts, and other basic tasks. See [[Qtopia on Neo 1973]] , http://www.qtopia.net/modules/mydownloads/ and the [http://www.qtopia.net/modules/newbb_plus/viewtopic.php?topic_id=473&forum=4 Qtopia forum] for more details.

The [[Neo1973]] from [[FIC]] is the first of possibly many phones that OpenMoko may be used on. Buy it at [https://direct.openmoko.com/ Openmoko Online Shop]. You may wish to see the [[SH1 FAQ|Shipment 1 FAQ]] and [[Phase 1 Software Testing]]

Please join us in collaborating on the OpenMoko project through any of the [[Development resources | project resources]] including this OpenMoko wiki. Please see the [[Help:Contents | wiki editing help]] page for information on making contributions to this wiki. A [[Meet the Core Team | core team]] of developers funded by FIC, Inc. leads the project.

An [[introduction]] page is available, with [[Introduction#Photos|photos]] and [[Introduction#Videos|videos]]. Moreover, the usual [[FAQ | Frequently Asked Questions]] (FAQ) page might be helpful. Developers may find the [[ChangeLog | change log]] an important resource.

Update 2007-07-25:  The [http://forums.makeopensource.com/ Unofficial OpenMoko Forums] are now open!  Everyone is invited to participate!


The members of the OpenMoko community would like to thank FIC Inc. for showing leadership and initiating the OpenMoko project.
