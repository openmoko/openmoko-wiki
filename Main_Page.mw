[[OpenMoko]] is an Open Source project with the goal of creating the world's first completely open mobile phone software stack. The project has been founded with that belief that standardization should start from the [[OpenMoko]] community verses the normal consortium oriented phone development environment.  [[OpenMoko]] has two aspects of development.  There is the initial FIC [[Neo1973]] hardware platform.  [[OpenMoko]] is the software stack that runs on this platform.  Eventually, [[OpenMoko]] will run on all kinds of Linux-capable mobile phones.  Please join us in colaborating on the [[OpenMoko | OpenMoko project]] through any of the [[Development resources | project resources]] including the [[Main Page | OpenMoko wiki]]. Please see the [[Help:Contents | wiki editing help page]] for information on making contributions to this wiki.  A [[Meet the Core Team | core team of developers from FIC Inc]] leads the project.

An [[Introduction | introduction page]] is available.  The [[Introduction | page]] has both [[Introduction#Photos|photos]] and [[Introduction#Videos|videos]] available.  Moreover, the usual [[FAQ | Frequently Asked Questions, FAQ, page]] might be helpful.  Developers may find the [[ChangeLog | daily software change log]] an important resource.

The members of the [[OpenMoko]] community would like to thank [[FIC|FIC Inc.]] for showing leadership and initiating the [[OpenMoko]] project.
