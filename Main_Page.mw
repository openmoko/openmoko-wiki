'''Openmoko™''' is a project dedicated to delivering mobile phones with an open source software stack. Openmoko was earlier more directly associated with Openmoko Inc, but is nowadays a gathering of people with the shared goal of "Free The Phone". Distributors are currently selling updated versions of the Openmoko Inc's phone released in 2008, [[Neo FreeRunner]], to advanced users, while the software stack for FreeRunner and future free phones is being developed by the community. A modern 3G / OMAP3 upgrade to FreeRunner, [http://projects.goldelico.com/p/gta04-main/ GTA04], is currently in [http://www.handheld-linux.com/wiki.php?page=GTA04 pre-order phase until 31 March 2012], see below. A complete [http://www.handheld-linux.com/wiki.php?page=GTA04%20Complete OpenPhoenux aka GTA04 Complete can be bought here].
