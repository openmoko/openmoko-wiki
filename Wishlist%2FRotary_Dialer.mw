So, this is mainly a joke, but it would be an interesting dispay app for the capabilities of the touchscreen environment and is a departure from the standard 'mouse' behavior of most touchscreens.

pseudo-code:
 if(release > init){
  value = null; // no backward dialing
 }elseif((init - release - 1) <= 0){
  value = null; // not enough mojo (moko?) in your stroke - try again.
 }elseif((init - release - 1) == 10){
  value = 0; // necessary substitution
 }else{
  value = init - release - 1;
 }

with these area values:
:(num) = positional value ''(if different)''
:black type = display value
