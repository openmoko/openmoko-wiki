==Distributions==
{{DistributionBox|
Name=Debian GNU/Linux |
Description=[[Debian]] is a universal operating system used on many other embedded devices, and also on home computers. Using Debian on the FreeRunner gives access to the huge army of software packaged in the Debian repositories, already compiled for the Neo's arm(v4) processor. Moreover, one can build one's own source files for programs without having to learn the OpenEmbedded way. For an existing Debian/Ubuntu user, choosing Debian for Neo FreeRunner makes phone a very familiar, trustworthy and flexible place to hack in.<br><br>
General news:
<br>
* The ARM servers sponsored by ARM Ltd. got activated, thus experimental packages are built for arm now. That means also fso-gsmd got built for the Freerunner.
* SHR packages have been removed from pkg-fso repository, they all arrived in Debian unstable, and just in time for Debian 6.0 freeze.
<br>
The biggest hurdle for official FreeRunner support in Debian is the kernel, since basically everything else starts to be in, in one form or another. There are currently two places with FreeRunner related kernels in Debian:
* Official kernel support for Neo FreeRunner devices is being developed by worked in a s3c24xx branch at http://git.debian.org/?p=pkg-fso/kernel.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/s3c24xx - thanks to Thibaut Girka and Google Summer of Code.
* The legacy 2.6.29rc3 kernel at http://git.debian.org/?p=pkg-fso/linux-2.6-openmoko.git also saw a slight update in August
