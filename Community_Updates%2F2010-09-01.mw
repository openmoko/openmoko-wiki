==Distributions==
{{DistributionBox|
Name=Debian GNU/Linux |
Description=[[Debian]] is a universal operating system used on many other embedded devices, and also on home computers. Using Debian on the FreeRunner gives access to the huge army of software packaged in the Debian repositories, already compiled for the Neo's arm(v4) processor. Moreover, one can build one's own source files for programs without having to learn the OpenEmbedded way. For an existing Debian/Ubuntu user, choosing Debian for Neo FreeRunner makes phone a very familiar, trustworthy and flexible place to hack in.<br><br>
* The ARM servers sponsored by ARM Ltd. got actived, thus experimental packages are build for arm now, thus fso-gsmd got built for the Freerunner.
* SHR packages have been removed from pkg-fso repository, they all arrived in Debian unstable.
