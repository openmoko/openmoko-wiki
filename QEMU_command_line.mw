The actual command line for starting the emulator may not be obvious if you use [[MokoMakefile]] command ''make run-qemu'' (or similar) to start it. However it is immediately visible in the Makefile in the root folder. If you need to start QEMU with options other than default, one of the ways is simply to create a new target, copy-pasting the ''run-qemu'', later changing the target name (for instance, into ''run-qemu-tty'') and editing the options.
