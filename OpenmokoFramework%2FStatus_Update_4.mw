=Openmoko Framework Team Status Report 2008.9.1=

Hi guys! This is the fourth Openmoko Framework Team Status update, featuring our third milestone release and more.

For the general motivation, the goals, and the way we are doing our work, please see http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/OpenmokoFramework.

== What happened since the last report ==

=== People ===

* Stefan Schmidt <stefan@openmoko.org> was reactivated and joined the framework team part-time -- welcome back, Stefan!

=== DBus APIs ===

* org.freesmartphone.GSM.Network: Added calls for USSD (requesting your pre-paid balance etc.)
* org.freesmartphone.Objects.ListObjectsByInterface: implemented what dbus is missing.
* org.freesmartphone.Device.PowerSupply: added support for status signals -- clients should no longer poll now.
* org.freesmartphone.Device.Audio: added scenario support.
* org.freesmartphone.Preferences: added.
* org.freedesktop.Time: added (experimental).

* Completely revamped documentation generation
* Set up a new site for API docs: [[http://docs.freesmartphone.org docs.freesmartphone.org]]

=== Implementations ===

'''Openmoko Framework Image -- 'On the Road' (Milestone III)'''

This is the third milestone release of the framework and the framework testing application 'Zhone'.

====Purpose====

A lightweight image that turns an Openmoko phone into a featurephone and that can serve as the basis for further application development using the freesmartphone.org dbus APIs.

==== What's new since Milestone II ====

'''Note: These are only the highlights. See the [http://git.freesmartphone.org gitweb] commit logs for the gory details...'''

* General
** Add dbus interface to configure debug logging level and destination at runtime

* odevice
** Implements org.freesmartphone.Device.PowerSupply (almost polling free [only for CC battries though])
** Implements org.freesmartphone.Device.PowerControl for Freerunner USB Host

* ogsmd (''renamed from ophoned'')
** Lots of bug and stability fixes
** Switched SMS handling to PDU mode -- the foundation for language support

* oeventsd (''revamped oeventd'')
** we now have a full-fledged user-tweakable rules engine using yaml-syntax to configure system-wide behaviour.
** Example:

<pre>
-
    trigger: IncomingMessage()
    actions: MessageTone(play)
-
    trigger: CallStatus()
    filters: HasAttr(status, "incoming")
    actions: RingTone(play)
-
    trigger: CallStatus()
    filters: Not(HasAttr(status, "incoming"))
    actions: RingTone(stop)
-
    trigger: Time(12,29)
    actions: Debug("A Test")
-
    trigger: CallStatus()
    filters: HasAttr(status, "active")
    actions: SetScenario(gsmhandset)
-
    trigger: CallStatus()
    filters: HasAttr(status, "release")
    actions: SetScenario(stereoout)
-
    trigger: PowerStatus()
    filters: HasAttr(status, "Charging")
    actions:
            - SetLed("gta02_power_blue", "dark")
            - SetLed("gta02_power_orange", "light")
-
    trigger: PowerStatus()
    filters: HasAttr(status, "Discharging")
    actions:
            - SetLed("gta02_power_blue", "dark")
            - SetLed("gta02_power_orange", "dark")
-
    trigger: PowerStatus()
    filters: HasAttr(status, "Full")
    actions:
             - SetLed("gta02_power_blue", "light")
             - SetLed("gta02_power_orange", "dark")
-
    trigger: PowerStatus()
    filters: HasAttr(status, "Critical")
    actions:
             - SetLed("gta02_power_blue","dark")
             - SetLed("gta02_power_orange","blink")
-
    trigger: InputEvent()
    filters:
             - HasAttr(switch, "HEADSET")
             - HasAttr(event, "pressed")
    actions: Command('amixer -d sset "Amp Spk" mute')
-
    trigger: InputEvent()
    filters:
             - HasAttr(switch, "HEADSET")
             - HasAttr(event, "released")
    actions: Command('amixer -d sset "Amp Spk" unmute')
</pre>

* opreferencesd
** Delivers configuration depending on the current profile

* opgsd (''new subsystem'')
** Stability fixes all over the place

* zhone
** Improved illume integration
** Add profile switcher

====Download / Installation====

# Grab a uImage and a .jffs2 for your device from http://downloads.openmoko.org/framework/milestone3/.
# Flash it to your Neo1973 (om-gta01) or NeoFreeRunner (om-gta02) with dfu-util.
# Boot and wait until the Zhone main window appears.
# Have fun.

====What you can expect from this release====

* Telephony
* Phonebook
* Messagebook (SMS)
* GPS
* frameworkd implementing the following dbus APIs:
** org.freesmartphone.Device.{Audio|Input|IdleNotifier|PowerSupply|Display|LED|PowerControl}
** org.freesmartphone.Usage
** org.freesmartphone.GSM.{Device|SIM|Network|PDP|CB|HZ}
** org.freedesktop.Gypsy

====What we expect from you====

* Feedback and comments for the dbus APIs. This is your chance to take an active role into shaping the application programming interface for all your cool applications.

* Focus on using the services. Zhone is just our testing-UI and bears little functionality. It's the services that matter.

* The best way to interact with the framework is by exploring the dbus APIs. For that you can use the two tools, which are already installed:
** [[OpenmokoFramework/mdbus|mdbus]] -- a dbus introspection and interaction utility,
** [[OpenmokoFramework/cli|cli-framework]] -- a python dbus command line interface.

* If you want to interact with the GSM modem, while the frameworkd is running, you can use [[OpenmokoFramework/mickeyterm|mickeyterm]] -- a MUXer-aware minimal terminal emulator.

===What's next===

* Google Summer of Code project integration
** Accellerometer Gestures
** Bluetooth Remote
** PIM
* Alarm support
