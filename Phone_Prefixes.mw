This page will eventually include all the prefixes you use for your countries in /etc/phone-utils.conf.

At first it'll be useful for other users, but when it'll be big enough we'll be able to set it up automatically according to your country.

Just dump the content of your /etc/phone-utils.conf

('''NOTICE:''' don't forget to add a single space before each line of the file when you dump it here so it'll show nicely inside a box in different lines)
