'''NOTICE:''' Add your country only if it's different than what appears in the following website: http://www.kropla.com/dialcode.htm 

This page will eventually include all the prefixes you use for your countries (and service providers) in /etc/phone-utils.conf.

At first it'll be useful for other users, but when it'll be big enough we'll be able to set it up automatically according to your country.

Just dump the content of your /etc/phone-utils.conf and add your country and service provider (you can drop it if it's the same for all in that country).

The area_code is not that important as we don't use it atm anyway and most countries started dropping that for cellphones.

('''NOTICE:''' don't forget to add a single space before each line of the file when you dump it here so it'll show nicely inside a box in different lines)
