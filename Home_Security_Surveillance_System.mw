'''Short description''':

This surveillance system consists of a webcam and a home server. The webcam captures the video. The home server makes the decision whether there is intruder or not based on the certain qualities of the video signal. 

If there is an intruder detected then it will send a message to the Neo FreeRunner.  The homeowner can then log into the home server to confirm whether the message is correct or not, and take appropriate action.
