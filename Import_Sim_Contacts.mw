Here is a [http://static.frimp.net/neo/addContact python script to import contacts from your SIM card into your neo].

Just copy it to your neo, install [http://static.frimp.net/neo/python-dbus_0.81.1-ml1_armv4t.ipk python-dbus], and then run:
  python addContact sim

It will import all of the contacts on your SIM into openmoko-contacts.  Unfortunately, my SIM doesn't seem to give a contact type, so I arbitrarily set the first phone number for a given name to Home, the next to Work, and any remaining to Cell numbers.  I figure it's far easier to click the drop-down & correct them as necessary than to type all your contact info in manually on the neo keyboard, which was my option before I wrote this :-)
