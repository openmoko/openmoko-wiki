{{FSO}}
This page documents the GSM networking solutions (commonly known as GPRS) using the [[OpenmokoFramework|FreeSmartphone.Org]] framework (FSO).

There are other ways to enable wireless communications on the smartphone, including [[Bluetooth]] and [[Wireless_Networking|WLAN]].

== Current state ==

Since milestone 2 the system dbus has been extended with methods that enables connectivity using GPRS. The functionality is available under <code>org.freesmartphone.ogsmd</code> at <code>/org/freesmartphone/GSM/Device</code>.

The implementation should not interfere with other phone functionality, such as placing calls. In other words: you can use GPRS while talking on the phone without hanging up. Note though that depending on hardware and networking, simultaneous data transmission and voice call alerting (let alone performing calls) might not be possible.

Since FSO is a middleware it offers no GUI, however it's fairly easy to use the methods available using any dbus tool.

The methods available:
 [METHOD]    org.freesmartphone.GSM.PDP.ActivateContext( s:apn, s:user, s:password )
 [METHOD]    org.freesmartphone.GSM.PDP.DeactivateContext()
 [METHOD]    org.freesmartphone.GSM.PDP.GetCurrentGprsClass()
 [METHOD]    org.freesmartphone.GSM.PDP.ListAvailableGprsClasses()
 [METHOD]    org.freesmartphone.GSM.PDP.SetCurrentGprsClass( s:class_ )
 [SIGNAL]    org.freesmartphone.GSM.PDP.ContextStatus( i:index, s:status, a{sv}:properties )

Use ''mdbus -s -l'' to monitor the emitted signals.  Signals will look roughly like this:

:ActivateContext( s:apn, s:user, s:password )
<pre>
[SIGNAL]    org.freesmartphone.GSM.PDP.ContextStatus 
 from :1.3 /org/freesmartphone/GSM/Device
 (dbus.Int32(1), dbus.String(u'outgoing'), 
  dbus.Dictionary({}, signature=dbus.Signature('sv')))
</pre>
:Once the connection is established (takes 3-4 seconds for me) a new signal is emitted
<pre>
[SIGNAL]    org.freesmartphone.GSM.PDP.ContextStatus    
 from :1.3 /org/freesmartphone/GSM/Device
 (dbus.Int32(1), dbus.String(u'active'), 
  dbus.Dictionary({}, signature=dbus.Signature('sv')))
</pre>
:DeactivateContext
<pre>
[SIGNAL]    org.freesmartphone.GSM.PDP.ContextStatus    
 from :1.3 /org/freesmartphone/GSM/Device
 (dbus.Int32(1), dbus.String(u'release'), 
  dbus.Dictionary({}, signature=dbus.Signature('sv')))
</pre>

== Using scripts ==

While we wait for the preferences part of FSO to be completed (and a GUI), we can use two shell scripts. You need to know three things to successfully connect via GPRS (your carrier should provide this information to you):
* the APN to use,
* the username, and
* the password.
If your APN has no username or password, you must still provide a string to satisfy the framework's input requirements.  Entering bogus data, such as the "x" above, will suffice.

To connect, put the following in a file and make it executable (<code>chmod +x gprs-on.sh</code>):
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
APN="internet.parlino.se"
USERNAME="x"
PASSWORD="x"
BUSNAME="org.freesmartphone.ogsmd"
OBJECTPATH="/org/freesmartphone/GSM/Device"
METHODNAME="org.freesmartphone.GSM.PDP.ActivateContext"
mdbus -s $BUSNAME $OBJECTPATH $METHODNAME $APN "$USERNAME" "$PASSWORD"
</pre>
To disconnect, use the following method instead (<code>chmod +x gprs-off.sh</code>):
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
BUSNAME="org.freesmartphone.ogsmd"
OBJECTPATH="/org/freesmartphone/GSM/Device"
METHODNAME="org.freesmartphone.GSM.PDP.DeactivateContext"
mdbus -s $BUSNAME $OBJECTPATH $METHODNAME
</pre>
The ''on'' script, using the ActivateContext method, will:
* setup a ppp interface (normally ppp0) (and assign IP address)
* setup (replace) the default route
* setup DNS
with settings received from the ISP.

For a list of known APN:s, see the [[GPRS#Some_APN_names_for_reference|main GPRS page]].


== Troubleshooting ==

* When a something like '''org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.UnknownMethod''' appears make sure that: 
** frameworkd is started of course
** That the method did not hide in an other place than expected follow the white [[D-Bus|Rabbit]]
* Online script runs without error but pppd did not start
** use '''logread''' to debug.... 
** Maybe the kernel module ppp-generic is not loaded, try modprobe.  ( you can do '''echo ppp-generic > /etc/modutils/ppp-generic''' and then '''update-modules''' to load the module at boot time )
** Maybe you have to do a '''mknod /dev/ppp c 108 0'''
* No MUX Channels available
** Means that the frameworkd has no free channel available to connect to the GSM Modem. 
** Restart the frameworkd and the phone Application (aka ophoned or zhone). Works fine for me. 
* MISC Troubleshooting
** Switch the frameworkd  loglevel to DEBUG (/etc/frameworkd.conf) 
** use the source!

== Using a GUI ==
[[Framework-settings]]

== SHR (Unstable??) ==
SHR is based on FSO, so I think its GPRS settings should be found here. Shr has its native setting manager which has Connectivity sub-panel which in turn has settings for GPRS. Its very intutive and your GPRS/FR should be up and running in no time.

To enable gprs on-demand you need to do some manual changes in framework code.

modem.py needs to be updated to setup idle timeout and auto reconnect. While pdp.py needs to be updated so ppp idle timeout resets /etc/resolv.conf to OpenDNS servers

Now, just fire up settings panel (need to be done once per boot) and
in connectivity click connect for Gprs...for me it doesn't show
connected anymore...but then I don't really care about that as long as
the connection works :)

Note: We are updating the framework file which can be updated by any
of the frameword update and one need to repeat the update (well..until
a nifty setting comes into setting panel somewhere :)
