=Disclaimer=

aTrack is a hobby project started out of need and interest for mobile programming. The code is not perfect but the quality might be evolving. Hopefully :)


=Installation=

Installation on SHR:

 opkg install atrack


=HAM licensing explanation=

Please note that usage within the aprs-is network requires amateur radio license, but for non-commercial usage you can run your own FOSS aprsd server http://sourceforge.net/projects/aprsd/, this is given by the license of the APRS protocol, both aprsd server and atrack are FOSS).

The username/login is a combination of your callsign, the password is generated by ''aprspass'' program, which comes from the aprsd package on your Linux desktop.

=YouLoc=

Atrack can also track on different services, i.e. has support for [http://youloc.net youloc.net], but then it acts as a dumb tracker only.

= Your server=

You can also run a fake small perl script server [http://code.google.com/p/atrack/wiki/PrivateAPRS_IS_FakeServer PrivateAPRS_IS_FakeServer] 


=Features=

* aprs login with a try to autoreconnect on failure
* aprs filter support
* receive messages/bulletins
* create/reply/forward message
* predefined text strings for quick messaging
* predefined list of recipients 
* ack autosend
* tracking + smart tracking - corner pegging (tracking on APRS and also on http://youloc.net/ )
* packet compression used on all packets
* pause tracking during phone call
* send status message
* send last know location
* calculate locator grid
* display nearby stations, objects, items
* edit/save into conf file
* portrait/landscape/fullscreen/day/night mode
* screen dim/suspend blocking
* APRS Query - replying to aprs query for position and status 
* send any Direct query, predefined Q for P, S, M, O, H, D
* create, edit Objects and Items with predefined names
* Mic-E encoded packets initial support (shows some funny failures sometimes)
* display a map with position if an object/station - based on Openstreetmap or actually on http://ojw.dev.openstreetmap.org/StaticMap/

=Known bugs=

* tracking is sometimes reduced to bearing change only. This is probably due to the tracking function calling ecore.timer, exiting with error at some point. Ideas welcomed.
