* the aux menu lets you search for BT keyboard and switch USB modes

== SSH ==

There is a root password by default : "root".

In the beta release, /root/.ssh/authorized_keys contains an entry for m@one. This is no intended backdoor, please replace it with your own SSH public key, or delete the file.

== Networking ==

Default networking is configured (FR 192.168.0.202, Gateway 192.168.0.200). You can [[Usb_networking#Configure_Default_Neo_DNS|modify]] this.

= Issues =

* The GSM can't be powered off with no SIM card inserted, he will persist on registering.
* If you enter your right SIM PIN and Hackable:1 say it's incorrect, press Cancel for the second PIN request and press the Antenna Button (right top) and select Power-Up GSM Antenna.
* Don't upgrade (apt-get upgrade), it will break the configuration (no uImage.bin installed, gps and gsm not working, ...)
