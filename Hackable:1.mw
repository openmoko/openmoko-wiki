'''hackable:1''' is a community distribution for hackable devices like the Openmoko Freerunner. It is based on Debian GNU/Linux, and while originally integrating a GNOME mobile platform its infrastructure assists in the generation of flashing-ready software images for embedded devices.

The latest releases are based on the [[DeforaOS]] Smartphone Environment, providing both the user interface (based on Gtk+) and the underlying GSM backend. They are labeled as "dse", of which the dse2 release was shipped on July 14th 2011.

Previously, [[Hackable:1|hackable:1]] has implemented the GNOME Mobile platform, as declined in the original [[OM2007.2]] software stack. This series of releases was labeled as "rev", of which the last stable version is rev5 (codename « Chuck »), released on December 22nd 2009.

The user and developer website is found at http://trac.hackable1.org/.
