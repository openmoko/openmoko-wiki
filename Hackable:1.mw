{{Distributions|Hackable:1}}

'''hackable:1''' intends to implement the Gnome Mobile platform and uses Debian stable as a base. It therefore aims at creating a Debian Mobile distribution. The [[OM2007.2]] software stack has been kept, improved, and packaged for Debian.

The latest stable version is the rev5, released the 22th December 2009, codenamed Chuck. It is using the openmoko applications and [[gsmd]]. The next version will use [[FSO]].

The user and developer wiki is at http://trac.hackable1.org and the user manual (wip) at http://trac.hackable1.org/trac/wiki/UserManual
