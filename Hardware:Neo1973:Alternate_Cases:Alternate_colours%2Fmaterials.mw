Identical geometry (material thickness may change slightly to allow for manufacturing process changes) to the one supplied as part of the phone, constructed from alternate materials. This would also allow for custom patterns to be etched/engraved/moulded/printed/embossed onto the case.

|5. ||[[User:Jackcday|Jackcday]] &mdash; Engraved would be very cool, Brushed Alum would be cool and possibly glow i/t dark or heat reactive material would be cool(change colour where you touch it!).
