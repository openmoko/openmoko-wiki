Welcome to Openmoko Cambridge!

We had a pub meet 9pm on Wednesday 8th October 2008 in the Cambridge Blue (Gwydir Street), and it was a laugh.  There is likely to be another one at some future date, so watch this space.  Register interest here or contact one of the people listed below if you want another meet organised!  Or organise it yourself!
