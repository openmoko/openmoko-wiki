Welcome to Openmoko Cambridge!

We had a pub meet 9pm on Wednesday 8th October 2008 in the Cambridge Blue (Gwydir Street), and it was a laugh.

The next one is scheduled "at [http://www.cambridge-camra.org.uk/pubguide/viewpub.php?id=297 the Granta pub], which apparently
is on Newnham Terrace, next door to Darwin College, at 7.30pm on friday
30.1.2009.  All are welcome; if you have an OpenMoko, you are encouraged to
bring it.  For those navigating by silicon, the postcode is apparently CB3
9EX."

There's a (low-volume) mailing list for arranging future ones which can be found at http://www.teaparty.net/mailman/listinfo/om-cambridge .
