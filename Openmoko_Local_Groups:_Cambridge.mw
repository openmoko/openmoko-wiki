Welcome to Openmoko Cambridge!

We had a pub meet 9pm on Wednesday 8th October 2008 in the Cambridge Blue (Gwydir Street), and it was a laugh.  IF memory serves, five mokos were in evidence, running a whole plethora of OSes. 

We had our second in the Granta pub on Friday
30.1.2009.  Three mokos were in evidence, all running 2008.12 (one testing, two stable).  Several other interested parties came, one specifically to try out a moko, and I believe he was impressed.

There's a (low-volume) mailing list for arranging future ones which can be found at http://www.teaparty.net/mailman/listinfo/om-cambridge .
