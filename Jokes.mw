'''E-mail quotes:'''

Hello,


Yesterday I accidentally put my OM phone near LCD TV (Samsung).

SW on OM is QT Extended and when I press power button (to wake up mobile) TV immediately turn off.

I tried again and TV changed channel. So, on my phone this behavioure is repeatable.

Is it normal behavioure?

Thanks in advance

Mile
