* A:  Well first we need to abandon the old lightbulb holder because at a later date we may not be able to plug a floodlight in,  bring in a new lightbulb holder and adapt it to multiple floodlights,  meanwhile the engineering team has realized that this will only run green floodlights and has started rewiring the whole house.. :)  The burnt out lightbulb is due to be fixed at a later date :)
