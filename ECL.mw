It's possible to "apt-get install ecl" on Debian on FreeRunner, but as of 23.11.2009 prepackaged ecl fails with "Absurd stack bottom value". This error is due to libgc, which tries to obtain stack bottom  from /proc/self/stat and fails. The workaround is to build ecl from source, configuring it with "--enable-boehm=included" and building garbage collector with USE_LIBC_PRIVATES defined. Worked for me with ecl 9.10.2.
