'''Short description''':

This game uses FreeRunner's direction sensing feature. We randomly produce some arrows pointing at different directions on the phone's screen. When the user sees the arrows, he/she should move the FreeRunner corresponding to the arrow direction shown on the phone's screen, if they are matched within certain period then the user scores. The difficulty of the game is by setting the speed that the arrows move and the time window that the correspondence between Freerunner
and arrows shown on the screen is measured. The faster the arrows moving and the smaller the time window, the more difficult is the game. The score is measured by counting how many matches the user got. This game can measure the responsiveness of the player, so it can be used for illness recovery besides for fun.
