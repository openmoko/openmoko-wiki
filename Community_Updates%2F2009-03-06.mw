Beside the distribution news, there are many events like FreerunnerMeeting (in Politecnico di Milano University), OSI Tech Days 2009 and Chemnitzer Linux-Tage 2009... etc, will be held during sprint time.

Finally, I would like to remind you all that there is nine days left for the registration of FreeRunner programming competition.

Stay tuned. There is more interesting information in this community update.

==Distributions ==
*'''[[FSO]] 5.1 has been released'''. FSO milestone5 to fix some bugs that crept into the release, notably the "not working on bootloaders that mount the root partition read-only".

*'''[http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2009-March/043143.html Running Gentoo on the Freerunner]'''
:Gentoo @ Openmoko team announced that they reached the first milestone for running Gentoo on the Freerunner. The goal of our project is to provide a way to cross- and natively compile all packages of the protage tree and feed back our fixes to the official tree.

:This mean you can cross- and natively compile a basic system including X, enlightenment, the FSO framework, WLAN tools and many more packages. Some phone GUIs went already into the overlay located at http://overlays.gentoo.org/proj/embedded

:To get started, please take a look at http://gentoo.mindzoo.de , or visit Gentoo@Openmoko team on the Freenode IRC channel '''#gentoo-openmoko'''.

:Under this project, you can expect:

:- the Gentoo feeling 
:- forget about version conflicts
:- frequent enlightenment updates
:- easy integration of new packages (start writing ebuilds yourself, it's trivial!)
:- multiple phone stacks
:- CHOICE

:* apply `sudo` or use root-terminal according to your taste ;)
:* Insert the uSD in your PC, `umount` all uSD-partitions that might have been automounted (use `mount` or `df -h` to check). Do not use "safely remove" for this.

:* `dd` the image "flash-moko11-2.image" to the physical(!) uSD-device (this will erase all data from your uSD!). `Sync` or `eject <device>`.

:* Insert uSD in your FR, boot from NOR-U-Boot to uSD, wait until green "d_o_n_e" shows on screen (takes some 6min). Remove bat and uSD, or login via ssh. `mickeyterm` will access modem.
