This page is here to collect the ideas, design mockups and thoughts about how [[Paroli]] could look like, how could it work. The plan is to create a new template to be used instead of the default black-and-white one. 

For motivation, have a look at the [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2009-May/048133.html Community driven redesign / new theme for Paroli] thread

* SMS writing in landscape mode: one small line for text and HUGE keyboard to be used with your fingers while walking
* Bling bling - what kind of effects do we have available? Fading, sliding..? I'd like to see it smoooth.

I love the black-and-white Paroli GUI, dubbed "Boring at Best" by someone in the mailinglist. It just needs tweeking; font sizes, alignments; it needs a few more concepts outlined - and it needs a sizzle - it should come alive when you start touching it. 

To prove myself it could really look nice, I did these mockups. I'm not sure what to do with them; I have similar sketches in mind (and on paper) for the Launcher and Dialer and a settings screen; but it's more then just pictures - some ""style guidelines""  too ..
