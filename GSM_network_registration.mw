We'd like to know the real network registration status by our NEO devices in the world.  Please provide some information about your NEO status!  The question list as below:

== Instructions ==

1. What NEO device you are using? [[GTA01]] or [[GTA02]].

2. Where is your location and what is your network provider? eg. T-Mobile, San Francisco in USA.

3. When you boot the NEO, how long it takes to register the network? eg. in normal case, it should be able to register to a network in 1~2 minutes immediately.

4. What is your GSM firmware version? You can get this number by an AT command. Using [[USB_Networking|SSH]] to connect to your NEO, then type these commands:
root@fic-gta02:~# [[Gsmd|libgsmd-tool]] -m atcmd
AT+CGMR
STR=`AT+CGMR'
RSTR=`+CGMR: "HW: GTA02BV5, GSM: gsm_ac_gp_fd_pu_em_cph_ds_vc_cal35_ri_36_amd8_ts0-Moko6"'

5. What is your [[IMEI]] code? Check by using this [[Hardware:AT Commands|AT command]] like previous steps.
AT+CGSN
STR=`AT+CGSN'
RSTR=`+CGSN: 000000000000000'

6. if NEO takes over 3 minutes to register to the network or it just re-register to the network again and again. Please attach your gsm log file ('/tmp/gsm.log') to our bugzilla, we already created a bug for [http://bugzilla.openmoko.org/cgi-bin/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1024 this issue].

(#4 and #5 Under FSO/frameworkd - use "mdbus -s org.freesmartphone.ophoned /org/freesmartphone/GSM/Device GetInfo" to retrieve both IMEI and version string at once - mdbus is provided by the package 'mickeydbus' if not already installed)

In qtopia/qtextended, go into Applications->System Info->Modem. Look for 'Revision'.
