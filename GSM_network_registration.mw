We'd like to know the real network registration status by our NEO devices in the world.  Please provide some information about your NEO status!  The question list as below:

1. What NEO device you are using? GTA01 or GTA02

2. Where is your location and what is your network provider? eg. T-Mobile, San Francisco in USA

3. When you boot the NEO, how long it takes to register the network? eg. in normal case, it should be able to register to a network in 1~2 minutes immediately.

4. What is your GSM firmware version? you can get this number by an AT command. Using SSH to your NEO, then type this command:
[http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/USB_Networking How to use SSH] [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Gsmd  How to use libgsmd-tool]
root@fic-gta02:~# libgsmd-tool -m atcmd
 AT+CGMR
 STR=`AT+CGMR'
 RSTR=`+CGMR: "HW: GTA02BV5, GSM: gsm_ac_gp_fd_pu_em_cph_ds_vc_cal35_ri_36_amd8_ts0-Moko6"'

5. What is your IMEI code? by this AT command like previous steps.
 AT+CGSN
 STR=`AT+CGSN' 
 RSTR=`+CGSN: 000000000000000'

6. if NEO takes over 3 minutes to register to the network or it just re-register to the network again and again. Please attach your gsm log file ('/tmp/gsm.log') to our bugzilla, we already created a bug for [http://bugzilla.openmoko.org/cgi-bin/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1024 this issue].
