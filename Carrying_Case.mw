* A neoprene, draw-string [[pouch]] is available from Openmoko and many distributers.

* TuxBrain has apparently developed a leather carrying-case a [http://www.tuxbrain.com/en/omcase.html carrying-case] specifically for the FreeRunner (and Neo1973). Also available from [http://www.pulster.de/engl/index.html?openmoko.htm Pulster] and [http://www.openmobile.nl/pages/winkel.php openmobile.nl]. The case is a `holster' design with a magnetic-closure flap, a stylus-holder, holes for access to the ports and buttons while the device is in the case, and a clip for attaching the case to a belt.

* A Nokia CP69 leather case can be modified to fit the Freerunner. There is a snap on the back, just unsnap it and sew a piece of velcro (about 5 to 7cm) over it. Since it's in the back of the case, it is not noticable. You can choose to wear it in a vertical or horizontal way. (Contact [[User:blen2r | blen2r]] if you need help)
