== User Provided tested SIM pictures ==

[[Image:ATT_3G_71234D_SIM.JPG|left|thumb|200px|AT&T 3G 71234 D]]

Base on community post:

The 71324 is the SKU for the AT&T latest UICC.
The 2022 is the Vendor and Version number. 

Some cards the vendor numbers are
   2 - G&D
   3 - Gemalto
   4 - Oberthur

Usually user will get CME ERROR 13 (sim failure), rather than CME ERROR 10 (sim not inserted) when 3G SIM not working. 

CME ERROR: 32 is Network not allowed, emergency calls only, might because the card not activated.

== Working and not working AT&T card ==

* Some AT&T cards have same vendor/ID number, but different contacts (Josh posted at 2008/8/24), following image shows that card that working (right) and not working (left) one.

Also, AT&T's new SIM card (left) will work with the Freerunner. It has been tested on om2008. On right is the same non-working SIM as the one shown in the above picture.
