{{Note|Tcsh users should use 'setenv VAR val' instead of 'export VAR=val', and '. file' instead of 'source file'.}}

After downloading an [[OpenEmbedded Torrent]], there are two variables that need to be exported in the shell environment. 

<pre>
 export MACHINE=om-gta02
 export OE_HOME=${HOME}/oe
</pre>

The following three variables are set here for the purpose of generality. They should be included in the name of your torrent file. 

 DISTRO=angstrom-2008.1
 ARCH=x86_64-linux
 TIMESTAMP=20090214
 TARBALL_LOC=${HOME}

Please follow the following instructions for preparing the pre-compiled OpenEmbedded build environment.

<pre>
 mkdir -p ${OE_HOME}
 tar xpjf ${TARBALL_LOC}/openmoko-${MACHINE}-${DISTRO}-${ARCH}-${TIMESTAMP}.tar.bz2 -C ${OE_HOME}
 cd ${OE_HOME}
 echo ${OE_HOME}/build-${MACHINE}/tmp > ${OE_HOME}/build-${MACHINE}/tmp
 source setup-env
</pre>

The next step is to rebuild non-portable packages required for native and cross compilation. All of such packages are pulled in via dependency, when building the 'console-image' recipe. 

 bitbake console-image

That's it! You are now ready to do system development or application development to your heart's content!
