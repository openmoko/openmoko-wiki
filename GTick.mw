== About Gtick ==
From [http://www.antcom.de/gtick/ Gtick's homepage]:

"GTick is a metronome application written for GNU/Linux and other UN*X-like operting systems supporting different meters (Even, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4 and more) and speeds ranging from 10 to 1000 bpm. It utilizes GTK+ and OSS (ALSA compatible). It is part of the GNU Project.

This program has been originally written by Alex Roberts, but since he didn't have the time to develop and maintain it further, I (Roland Stigge) took it over (initially to package it for Debian, but there were too many "upstream" issues, so I decided to maintain the whole package). Since then, the program has been mainly rewritten (new DSP core, GTK+2 port, added features). "

== Installation ==

==== Package ====
I've created a new [http://www.file-upload.eu/download-1422942/gtick_0.1_armv4t.ipk.html package] . Now it checks for libsndfile1 and you'll get a nice desktop icon.

Please test it and add feedpack on this page.


Important:
Use 
<code>modprobe snd-pcm-oss</code>
to get /dev/dsp .

You can add this in GTick's preferences in the "execute on startup" field.

==== Problems ====

If you have speech-dispatcher installed (navit uses it) you may come upon this problem:[http://lists.openmoko.org/nabble.html#nabble-td2175057  speech-dispatcher blocking /dev/dsp] .
For a quick workaround just stop speech-dispatcher with <code>/etc/init.d/speech-dispatcher stop</code>

==== Source ====

You can get the source from [http://www.antcom.de/gtick/].

== usage ==
To make the sound louder either use the gui control for volume or increase "Headphone" and "PCM" setting with alsamixer.


Start it from the command line: <code>gtick</code>
or with ssh: <code>DISPLAY=:0 gtick</code>


Tip: Use the app in landscape mode.

== ToDo ==
feel free to make it better :)

* create package
* make the interface more finger friendly
