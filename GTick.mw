== About Gtick ==
From [http://www.antcom.de/gtick/ Gtick's homepage]:

"GTick is a metronome application written for GNU/Linux and other UN*X-like operting systems supporting different meters (Even, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4 and more) and speeds ranging from 10 to 1000 bpm. It utilizes GTK+ and OSS (ALSA compatible). It is part of the GNU Project.

This program has been originally written by Alex Roberts, but since he didn't have the time to develop and maintain it further, I (Roland Stigge) took it over (initially to package it for Debian, but there were too many "upstream" issues, so I decided to maintain the whole package). Since then, the program has been mainly rewritten (new DSP core, GTK+2 port, added features). "

== installation ==
Get source from [http://www.antcom.de/gtick/] and compile it.

It worked well for me on my SHR.

Use 
<code>modprobe snd-pcm-oss</code>
to get /dev/dsp .
Gtick has an option for executing commands on startup, so you start compatility mode there.

I had this problem:[http://lists.openmoko.org/nabble.html#nabble-td2175057  speech-dispatcher blocking /dev/dsp] . Killing the speech-dispatcher process helped.


I have created a [http://www.file-upload.eu/download-1421594/gtick-0.4.2_0.1_armv4t.ipk.html package] for testing. It's my first package, and I haven't checked it yet(e.g. for dependences), but it worked for me. Feel free to test it or make you own package and share it here.
Unsatisfied dependencies:
* libsndfile <code>opkg install libsndfile</code>

== usage ==

Tip: Use the app in landscape mode.

== ToDo ==
feel free to make it better :)

* create package
