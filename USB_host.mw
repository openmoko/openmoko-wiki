== The Neo1973 as a USB host ==
The Neo1973's mini-usb port can be configured to act as a usb host instead of a usb device. This opens up a range of possibilities, such as usb cameras and usb input devices.

This used to require a kernel patch [http://bugzilla.openmoko.org/cgi-bin/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=876 as an attachment in Bugzilla], but that same page now details how to do this <i>without</i> any kernel hacking:


Tell the device that it is logically a host:

<code>echo "host" > /sys/devices/platform/s3c2410-ohci/usb_mode</code>


Instruct the device to provide 5 volts:

<code>echo 1 > /sys/devices/platform/neo1973-pm-host.0/hostmode </code>


Note: This second command failed for me and I was unable to use <code>echo</code> to change the 0 to a 1. Using <code>vi</code>, however, worked as expected.

Note: You may want to run <code>ifconfig usb0 down</code> prior to switching to usb host mode, as the Neo's usb networking may not like having it's usb port disappear. You'll probably want to ssh into your Neo over WiFi or Bluetooth before starting all of this, alternatively use an on screen keyboard.

=== Three-Headed Cable ===
At the moment, you'll have to manufacture this one yourself. You need to make a cable with three ends:

* A mini-usb type B cable for the Neo itself
* A cable of whatever type to go to your usb device.
* A cable going to a +5V voltage source with enough power for your device and to charge the Neo. This could be a wall charger or even another usb plug.

You just connect the Data+ and Data- wires of the Neo and the device, and connect all of the ground wires together and all of the +5V wires together. This powers the Neo and the device, while letting the neo talk to the device.

Just for reference, the USB wires from left to right are:
*Black: Power -
*Green: Data -
*White: Data +
*Red: Power +

=== Console ===
Although you could use a USB keyboard, you may want to have a console while you're doing all of this. You'll probably want to use bluetooth in conjunction with pand to set up bluetooth networking.

See [[Manually_using_Bluetooth]]

=== Power Concerns ===
You'll need to force the Neo to go into fast charge mode, since it can't do its usual power negotiation over USB.

<code>echo -n "fast_cccv" >  /sys/devices/platform/s3c2410-i2c/i2c-adapter/i2c-0/0-0008/chgmode</code>
