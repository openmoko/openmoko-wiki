== The Neo1973 as a USB host ==
The Neo1973's mini-usb port can be configured to act as a usb host instead of a usb device. This opens up a range of possibilities, such as usb cameras and usb input devices.

In order to get this working, you need the proper patch (more on that in a few days), and a special cable.

=== Three-Headed Cable ===
At the moment, you'll have to manufacture this one yourself. You need to make a cable with three ends:

* A mini-usb type B cable for the Neo itself
* A cable of whatever type to go to your usb device.
* A cable going to a +5V voltage source with enough power for your device and to charge the Neo. This could be a wall charger or even another usb plug.

You just connect the Data+ and Data- wires of the Neo and the device, and connect all of the ground wires together and all of the +5V wires together. This powers the Neo and the device, while letting the neo talk to the device. 


=== Console ===
Although you could use a USB keyboard, you may want to have a console while you're doing all of this. You'll probably want to use bluetooth inconjunction with pand to set up bluetooth networking.

See [[Manually_using_Bluetooth]]

=== Power Concerns ===
You'll need to force the Neo to go into fast charge mode, since it can't do its usual power negotation over USB.
