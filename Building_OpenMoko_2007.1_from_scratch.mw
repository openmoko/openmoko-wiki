{{warning|This is still a preliminary version, which will take some more days until it has all the updates.}}

This is a guide describing how to set up a running OpenMoko
system from scratch.

If you just want to run OpenMoko applications on your PC, just perform the
"Obtaining OpenMoko SVN tree" step below and then go to
[[How to run OpenMoko Apps on PC]]. If you want to autoinstall all required tools and resources, consider using [[MokoMakefile]] -- script developed by Rod Whitby.

Do not treat this as a linear script! There are various configuration items you
need to set (or skip, as it may be), operations that depend on how your
host(s) is/are set up, and also on the hardware revision of the target platform
(i.e., the phone).

Instead, look at each step, read the instructions, copy and paste what
makes sense for you, and adapt what you disagree with. Links to original and
background material in the Wiki are included wherever useful.


== Preparation ==

===  Roles  ===

The build process may spread over multiple machines. They have the following
roles:

;'''BUILD''': build host, with quick access to the files and CPU power. Must have Internet access.
;'''LAB''': lab machine connected to the debug board (serial and JTAG) and to USB on the Neo (since this will probably be just a single machine, the roles are not further divided)
;'''CARD''': machine with a USB-attached SD/MMC card reader

All machines are assumed to share the same filesystem layout. At the beginning of
each of the sections below, the respective role is indicated. "('''all''')" is for
settings that apply to all machines, or that - for simplicity - can be
applied to all of them.


=== Directory layout ===
'''(Roles: all)'''

<pre>
$OMDIR (/home/moko)	base directory for the whole tree
  openmoko/		files from OpenMoko subversion (SVN) repository
  openembedded/		files from OpenEmbedded (OE) Monotone repository
  sources/		cached downloads of OE
  build/		OE build directory
</pre>


===  Environment variables ===
'''(Roles: all)'''

For simplicity, we just set these environment variables on all hosts
involved. If you're not comfortable with this, feel free to weed out the ones
you don't need.

Our base directory (configure this for local arrangements):

 export OMDIR=/home/moko

The search path for BitBake files. Note that the order is of vital
importance.

 export BBPATH=$OMDIR/build:$OMDIR/openmoko/trunk/oe:$OMDIR/openembedded


===  Permissions  ===
'''(Role: BUILD)'''

In order to perform the build process, you have to obtain the following
permissions:

* write access to the OpenMoko SVN repository (in principle, it should be possible to simplify this to read access. For further study.)


===  Build host prerequisites  ===
'''(Role: BUILD)'''

There must be at least 7 GB of free space on $OMDIR.

In addition to the traditional development tools (gcc, patch, etc.), the
following packages must be installed on the build host:

;subversion: version control system used by OpenMoko and others. 
;quilt:	patch management system used by the Linux kernel and others
;monotone: version control system used by OpenEmbedded. This should be a recent version, e.g., 0.32, although also 0.31 should work.
;diffstat: the OE build process wants this
;texi2html: this too
;git: version control system used by the Linux kernel and others. Do not confuse this with the "GNU Interactive Tools"

Furthermore, the following package can be installed optionally:
;psyco: Python just-in-time compiler. Speeds up OpenEmbedded builds (with BitBake) considerably. Strongly recommended.

==== Distro Specific Software Installation ====
;Gentoo: Gentoo users can obtain all this with (note that, at the time of writing, Monotone 0.32 isn't available without setting the ~x86 keyword):
<pre>
echo 'dev-util/monotone ~'`readlink /etc/make.profile | awk -F / '{print $6}'`\
  >>/etc/portage/package.keywords
emerge -u subversion quilt monotone diffstat texi2html dev-util/git psyco
</pre>
;Other Distos: [http://www.openembedded.org/wiki/OEandYourDistro  Instructions for installing prerequisites in other distributions]

===  Lab host prerequisites  ===
'''(Role: LAB)'''

The following package must be installed on the lab host:
;xc: a simple communications program for the serial port

Gentoo users can obtain this with:
 emerge -u xc

Note that similar communications programs, such as "cu" or "minicom", may be used as well.

===  Assumptions  ===
'''(Roles: LAB, CARD)'''

We make the following assumptions about hardware setup and devices:

* the serial console of the Neo phone is connected to /dev/ttyS0 on '''LAB''' (see [[Debug_Board]])
* the JTAG [[wiggler]] is connected to /dev/parport0 on '''LAB'''. See [[Debug Board]] and  [[Connecting_GTA01Bv2_with_Debug_Board]]
* cards inserted in the SD/MMC card reader appear as /dev/uba on '''CARD''' and can be mounted on /mnt/tmp (we'll specify the mount point explicitly, so the directory has to be there, but we don't need to specify the mount point in /etc/fstab). If in doubt,
 mkdir -p /mnt/tmp

== Obtaining Sources and build system ==

===  OpenEmbedded build: initial downloads  ===

First, we obtain a snapshot of the OpenEmbedded-based tree used by OpenMoko, plus the OE build tool called BitBake.


==== Obtaining OpenMoko SVN tree ====
'''(Role: BUILD)'''

Obtain the latest revision of the OpenMoko tree. Unfortunately, at some places, "current" versions of upstream packages may get included, thus the build may still fail. If it does, you may wish to inform the authorities.

The checkout should take about 45 minutes over an Internet connection with a round-trip time to svn.openmoko.org of 350 ms.

<pre>
cd $OMDIR
svn co http://svn.openmoko.org/ openmoko
</pre>

==== Installing BitBake ====
'''(Role: BUILD)'''

Install version 1.6 of BitBake, the build tool of OE. (This is quick.)

<pre>
svn co http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/bitbake/branches/bitbake-1.6/ bitbake
cd bitbake
./setup.py install
cd ..
</pre>


==== Obtaining OpenEmbedded snapshot ====
'''(Role: BUILD)'''

Obtain a snapshot of the Monotone repository of OpenEmbedded, then update it
to the latest version, and finally check out our "known to be good" revision.
We extract things into $OMDIR/openembedded. OE.mtn.bz2 is about 100 MB.

<pre>
wget http://www.openembedded.org/snapshots/OE.mtn.bz2
bunzip2 OE.mtn.bz2
mtn --db=OE.mtn pull monotone.openembedded.org org.openembedded.dev
mtn --db=OE.mtn checkout --branch=org.openembedded.dev \
  -r e2dbb52fe39df7ef786b6068f6178f29508dfded openembedded
</pre>

{{note|For advanced users: if you ever want to update to the latest version of the repository, you would do a "pull" (see above), followed by:
 cd $OMDIR/openembedded && mtn update}}


Set up the directories for the cache of upstream files and all material
related to local builds, then put our configuration file there (see also
[[OpenMoko#Setting_up_an_OpenMoko_SDK]]):

<pre>
mkdir -p sources build/conf
cat <<EOF >build/conf/local.conf
MACHINE = "fic-gta01"
DISTRO = "openmoko"
BUILD_ARCH = "`uname -m`"
EOF
</pre>

=== OpenEmbedded build: fixes ===
'''(Role: BUILD)'''

There are unfortunately some problems in the build process. 
The following fixes work around them:

 cd $OMDIR/sources
 mkdir -p ../build/tmp/stamps/armv4t-linux

* upstream moves old packages away, gratuitously breaking downstreams

 wget http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/js/older-packages/js-1.5.tar.gz
 touch ../build/tmp/stamps/armv4t-linux/js-1.5-r0.do_fetch

* us2.samba.org mirror has vanished

 wget http://us4.samba.org/samba/ftp/stable/samba-3.0.14a.tar.gz
 touch ../build/tmp/stamps/armv4t-linux/samba-3.0.14a-r15.do_fetch

* ghastly patch with CRLF and trailing blanks

 perl -pi.orig -e 's/ *$//;s/\r//g' \
   ../openembedded/packages/gcc/gcc-4.1.1/gcc-4.1.1-pr13685-1.patch


== Building ==

=== OpenEmbedded build ===
'''(Role: BUILD)'''

openmoko/trunk/oe/conf/site.conf expects the OpenMoko-specific OE packages in $OMDIR/oe

 cd $OMDIR
 ln -s openmoko/trunk/oe .

We're now ready to run the build. This will take a while.

 cd $OMDIR/build
 bitbake openmoko-devel-image

Note that the build will stop several times to ask for SVN access and whether
to accept certificates. If you're not quick enough to respond, the underlying
session may time out. In this case, just restart "bitbake
openmoko-devel-image" and it will pick up from where it left off.

The whole build process involves numerous downloads, takes about 7 hours
on an Athlon 64 3200+ (about 1.5h of delays were caused by ftp.debian.org not
working properly during this test run), and ends with a message like this:

 Build statistics:
   Attempted builds: 4

== Installation ==

=== Flash boot loader into NAND ===
'''(Role: LAB)'''

As a first step, we transfer the u-boot bootloader into NAND Flash, through
the JTAG interface. We use JTAG, since this is the most basic way for doing
this, ensuring that we only depend on as little to work on the Neo as
possible.

For this, the u-boot image for the right board version and the desired
build date must be chosen. E.g., an image built for a gta01bv2 board on
February 3, 2007 at 13:40:41 would be called
u-boot_nand-gta01bv2-20070203134041.bin

The name is composed as follows:
;u-boot: the name of the component
;nand: it is it be loaded from NAND (not directly from RAM, see also [[Bootloader#Using_JTAG_to_boot_from_RAM]])
;gta01bv2: the hardware revision of the board
;20070203134041: the build date and time
;.bin: this is a binary suitable for flashing/loading

If this is the first build, there will only be one image for each board
version, thus we can use wildcards. Change the gta01bv2 below to gta01v3 or
gta01v4, if necessary.

See also: [[Sjf2410-linux]]

<pre>
cd $OMDIR/build/tmp/deploy/images

( echo 0; echo 0; echo 0; echo 3; ) |
  ./sjf2410 -b -f `echo u-boot_nand-gta01bv2-*.bin`
</pre>

This will take approximately 12 minutes.


=== Copy kernel and root FS to microSD card ===
'''(Role: CARD)'''

There are several ways to provide the Neo with its kernel and the root file
system. (See [[Bootloader]] for some of them.)
The most self-contained way is to put everything into NAND Flash.
To transfer the files to the Neo, we first place them on the microSD card.

Memory cards, including microSD, usually come pre-formatted with VFAT. We
prefer ext2 (e.g., because we may want to store a real Linux file system on the
card as well). The following steps are needed to convert the card from VFAT to
ext2:
<pre>
sfdisk -c /dev/uba 1 83
mke2fs -m0 /dev/uba1
tune2fs -c0 -i0 /dev/uba1
</pre>

Next, we copy the kernel uImage and the root file system image to the card.
As discussed in the previous section, we can use wildcards if this is our
first build.
<pre>
cd $OMDIR/build/tmp/deploy/images
mount /dev/uba1 /mnt/tmp
cp uImage-2.6-moko7-r1-fic-gta01-*.bin /mnt/tmp/uImage
cp openmoko-devel-image-fic-gta01-*.rootfs.jffs2 /mnt/tmp/rootfs.jffs2
umount /mnt/tmp
</pre>

Now, insert the microSD card into the Neo, but don't power it on yet.
(If you did anyway, don't worry. We'll power cycle it later.)


=== Serial console ===
'''(Role: LAB)'''

We use a serial console connecting through the debug board. This example uses
"xc", which is a small and simple communications program. Many people prefer
"cu" or the considerably more bloated "minicom", which will work as well.

* Prepare xc configuration
<pre>
cat <<EOF >$HOME/xc.init
set bps 115200
terminal
EOF
</pre>

* Connect to the target
 xc -l /dev/ttyS0 -t


=== Start the Neo and enter the boot prompt ===
'''(Role: LAB)'''

Our first interaction with the target. If this doesn't work, please check
that the debug board is connected properly to the serial port.

Disconnect power and USB from the phone, wait a couple of minutes, then connect power.
You may have to press and hold the power button on the Neo for a few seconds to turn it on.
The power button is located next to the USB port.

Some people have observed stability issues if the device was reset without
power cycling or if USB was not disconnected when power cycling, yet details of what is really happening aren't very clear yet.

On the serial console, a message like this should appear:
<pre>
U-Boot 1.2.0 (Feb  3 2007 - 13:07:21)
Press any key to enter the boot prompt:
GTA01Bv2 #
</pre>

Note that the boot prompt changes with the hardware revision you have. If the
message does not appear after a few seconds, try power cycling again.

If xc responds to pressing a button with
"Verify that you are trying to use a valid and operational tty port."
the port may be stuck, waiting for DCD to be asserted. The quickest way to
get out of this situation is to disconnect the serial cable from the debug
board, run the following command
 while ! stty -F /dev/ttyS0 clocal; do : ; done

stick something metallic, e.g., a paper clip or a screwdriver, into the plug on the cable,
and keep on fumbling with
it until DCD gets set and the loop above stops spitting out error messages.

=== Flash kernel and root FS into NAND ===
'''(Role: LAB)'''

We now load the kernel and the root FS from the microSD card into memory and
subsequently transfer them to NAND Flash. All this is done by entering
commands at the boot prompt.

Each time we want to write new data to the NAND Flash, we first have to erase
the previous content. We do this individually for each partition. While it would
also be possible to erase some or all relevant partitions in one step, this would
require the user to look up addresses from the partition table and to perform
calculations which are inconvenient at best.

See also: [[U-boot]]

* Initialize the SD/MMC interface. The "Product Name" shown will be just binary garbage. This is expected behaviour.

 GTA01Bv2 # mmc

* Load the uImage file into memory. "ext2load" stores the number of bytes read as a hexadecimal number in the environment variable "filesize".

 GTA01Bv2 # ext2load mmc 0 0x32000000 uImage

* Erase the kernel partition and write the uImage from memory to NAND Flash

 GTA01Bv2 # nand erase kernel
 GTA01Bv2 # nand write.e 0x32000000 kernel ${filesize}

* The root file system is next. We need to specify the correct size, which is shown at the end of "ext2load", e.g., "0x1608000)" in this case:

 GTA01Bv2 # ext2load mmc 0 0x32000000 rootfs.jffs2
 23101440 (0x1608000) bytes read
 GTA01Bv2 # nand erase rootfs
 GTA01Bv2 # nand write.e 0x32000000 rootfs ${filesize}

=== Configure the boot loader ===
'''(Role: LAB)'''

Last but not least, we have to set up the boot loader to automatically boot
from Flash. For this, we use the default environment settings, which we obtain
by erasing the old content of the environment, and letting u-boot restore the
settings after a restart.

Before touching the environment, you may have to update the environment offset.
Please see [[Migration_to_bad_block_tolerant_builds#Partition_sizing]] for details.
(We may simplify this particularly awkward and error-prone procedure in the
future.)

* First, remove erase the old environment:
 GTA01Bv2 # nand erase env

* We reset to force the boot loader to use the default settings.
 GTA01Bv2 # reset

Wait until the "U-Boot [...]" message, then hit a key. It will display 
 *** Warning - bad CRC or NAND, using default environment

* Re-generate the partition information in the environment variable "mtdparts":

 GTA01Bv2 # dynpart

* Save the restored settings in NAND
 GTA01Bv2 # saveenv

* Power cycle to boot the Neo (see remarks above)
