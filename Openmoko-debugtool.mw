This simple tool can be used to achieve some repetitive tasks without the need of the terminal. This is mostly useful to speedup the configuration of the phone or to execute the following tasks without the pen:
* Set fast charge mode
* Switch USB operation mode between host and device
* Set time
* Switch sound profile
* Set DNS configuration
* Enable Bluetooth hardware
* Scan Bluetooth devices
* Create a PAN networking connection with a BT device

The tool can be started from the "applications" menu. Some features are not implemented for the moment but some updates will be posted soon. The code will also be included after a cleanup. The tool is working with both versions of the kernel (2.6.22 and 2.6.24). In some cases it may fail to install because of unavailable dependencies. Before this problem is corrected, it is safe to install it using the -force-depends option of ipkg.
