== Overview ==
This page is intended for ordinary end users of [[OpenMoko]] smartphones.   It lists some of the cool applications provided by the Openmoko community that you can install and enjoy.   Freedom to share!    You can find many more applications here - http://projects.openmoko.org 

'''Please note that not all of these applications are in a finished format yet.   When they are complete you will be able to download them via a menu on the phone.    At the moment, following a recipe of commands in the console window may be needed to install.   This will of course improve with time :-) '''

'''Please also note that there is "some risk" in installing developing software or software from an unknown source!    However, if the license for the code is an open source license then you have the comfort that anyone in the OpenMoko community has the power to check the operation of the software and thus malicious or vulernable code is minimised'''

Any problems with the software below should be reported to the individual software developer rather than the OpenMoko core team.

== Note to application developers ==

No more than 8 featured OpenMoko Community Applications should be listed on this page at a time.     The main place for OpenMoko device owners to browse software remains http://projects.openmoko.org.      Applications listed here should have mass appeal as an advert of what the platform can do for Linux fans and ordinary smartphone users alike.

Please provide
* a link to your project page
* a short video if possible
* screenshots
* indicate whether your application is stable or still under development 
* state which models of OpenMoko phone the application is designed for.
* a short paragraph describing features
* the license the code is provided under

Please add your application to the bottom of the list
