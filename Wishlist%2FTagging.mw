Tags can be used by various applications. Requirement is interoperability for further enhancement. Tags should be applied to calendar events, mail/sms, calls, places(GPS) and files.

Tags could be used instead of contact groups, this way one contact could be a part of
 - Friends
 - Work
 - Emergency auto
Say, if I wanted to send an SMS or e-mail to my friends, the group could also include people whom I've gotten to know at work.
The Emergency auto tag would automatically pass the caller thorough the emergency call screening system, without the need for user input. (For more information on this feature, please see [[Wishlist:user screening]]
