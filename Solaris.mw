= Building on Solaris =

(Well, OpenSolaris)

After a few dead starts, the best way to build on Solaris is to use a BrandZ Linux zone, and install enough stuff into the CentOS-3 image to make it all work.

Using these directions for setting up the zone:

Try to install what you can from the package list in MokoMakefile

The rest, here's what I've had to install so far:

# apr-1.3.3/ -- for subversion
# apr-util-1.3.4/  -- for subversion
# bash-3.2/ -- the builtin cp doesn't take the -t option, the one in this newer bash does.
# diffstat-1.46/
# help2man-1.36.4/  -- build without NLS.
# git-1.6.0.2/
# ncftp-3.2.2/ -- to make CPAN happy about Locale::gettext
# neon-0.28.3/  -- for subversion
# Python-2.6/  -- for the proper sqlite support
# sqlite-3.6.3/  -- for python
# subversion-1.5.3/  -- yum didn't have this.
# texi2html-1.64/

Actually, whenever you have the option, --disable-nls in the configure scripts seems to make life a lot easier.

This is being written as I do it, so note that it'll change until I've gotten a full build (make image) done.  After that, it's dfu-util!
