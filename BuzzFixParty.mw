= Here you can find information about upcoming buzz-fix parties =

 Just as a nice gesture for those putting in so much effort organising these parties:
 When you attend a party or send your device via post, you could bring along or include
 in the package some local delicacies like sweets or cookies or a small souvenir.
 (This part is not written by one of the organisers.)

== Braunschweig ==

* '''When:''' May 1st - May 3rd, start will be 09:00
* '''Where:''' Student pub "Monkey Island" at Rebenring 64 in Braunschweig, Germany. The entrance is at the south-west corner of the dormitory "Affenfelsen" (see http://informationfreeway.org/?lat=52.27432513952919&lon=10.522477178117994&zoom=17&layers=B0000F000F). From Braunschweig main station you can take the lines M1, M2 or M19 and get off at "Hamburger Straße".
* '''What:''' Please indicate in the list how many devices you will bring. The rework itself will take about 40 minutes. Testing device before and after (including flashing) will take a couple of minutes, but can be parallelised. The day has 24 hours. You do the math. :-)
* '''How:''' Back up all your data! We will flash a testing image into the flash and there is a possibility that the Freerunner will get damaged during the process (Though I haven't broken any device yet). Exchange devices for the ones I might break will be there.
* '''Why:''' There will be other Freerunner users around. Use the time to get to know each other in person, share problems, fixes, ...
