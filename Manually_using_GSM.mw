Thankfully, this may now be partially obsolete.
The dialer now works!

This is a short guide how to manually get GSM going.

== Requirements ==

* GTA01Bv2 or GTA01Bv3 with very recent u-boot bootloader, providing usbtty (serial over USB) support)
* Do not connect any debug board!

== Walk-Through ==

=== Booting the system ===

* Make sure the rootfs you use has 'auto usb0' in /etc/network/interfaces
* Configure the host's usb0 interface to 192.168.0.200 netmask 255.255.255.0
* ssh to root@192.168.0.201

=== Disabling the getty ===

Our default images all have a getty running on /dev/ttySAC0, please edit /etc/inittab and disable the getty on that port

=== Reducing the loglevel ===

{{note|You don't need this in kernel builds with patchset
