opimd is a PIM suite for FSO.

To get some help, check this mail: http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2009-May/048064.html

At the moment main developer of opimd is dos1. You can find him at IRC on #openmoko-cdevel freenode channel.

==Reference client implementation==
pim.py [http://openmoko.opendevice.org/svn/opimd/pim.py] is general script which can be used for testing, and to understand how it's done (code) :) ATM it supports querying, adding, editing and deleting contacts, and querying messages. I hope --help say everything about usage :)
==Test scripts==
opimd-resolve.py [http://openmoko.opendevice.org/svn/opimd/opimd-resolve.py] is simple script which can resolve given in arguments phone numbers to names from contacts.

pimm-gui.py [http://openmoko.opendevice.org/svn/opimd/pimm-gui.py] is ATM some kind of playground. It displays messages in elementary Bubbles. It is going to be opimd feeded chat-style messages app.
==Troubleshooting==
At the moment SIM backends has to be inited manually. You can do it by InitAllSources method ("./pim.py c init" or "./pimm-gui.py init")
