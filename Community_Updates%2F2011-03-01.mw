== Hardware ==
=== GTA04EA (Early Adopter) ===
Since the last community update there has been some progress in the project. Nearly all critical components arrived. The only missing part should now be the CPU, so they even got the very critical POP-memory which was hard to find. So the component "changelog" is the following:
* MT29C4G96MAZAPCJG-5 IT (512 MB RAM, 512 MB NAND Flash)
* DM3730CBP (800 MHz version)
* TPS65950A3 (latest version of the power controller)
* TFDU6301 (IrDA module substitutes the previous HSDL3602)
Due to two reasons the PCB layout is being reworked:
* canceling out power supply issues
* add shielding and tunnels for the most critical audio signals to make sure there is no buzz-fixes are needed.
