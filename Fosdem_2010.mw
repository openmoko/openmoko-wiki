Fosdem is a great FOSS developers conference located in Brussels, Belgium. For those who don't know fosdem, check the site (scroll down). For those who do know fosdem: I (pieterc) have entered a dev room request (2009/10/27) for openmoko.

1/12: Update: dev room request was declined

This however, should not be a reason why we should be absent. There were a lot of devroom requests, and openmoko could be filed under: Mobile+Embedded devroom. So if someone has an idea, please bring it forward, and maybe we'll be able to bring it to a wider audience.
