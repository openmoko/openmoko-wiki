[[USB]] CDC (Communications Device Class) ACM (Abstract Control Model) is a vendor-independent publicly documented protocol that can be used for emulating serial ports over USB.

CDC ACM is used to access the U-boot bootloader prompt over USB (see: [[U-boot#Using_usbtty_from_Linux]]).

== Hardware specifics ==

=== Neo1973 and CDC ACM ===

The Neo1973 [[u-boot]] boot loader contains support for obtaining the boot loader prompt over USB CDC ACM.

The Openmoko kernel also contains CDC ACM device support, contained in the '''g_serial.ko''' kernel module.

=== Host PC and CDC ACM ===

==== Linux ====

Linux has a generic CDC ACM host-side implementation in the kernel module '''cdc_acm.ko'''

On 2.6.25 this is at "Device Drivers -> USB support (USB_SUPPORT [=y]) -> Support for Host-side USB (USB [=m]) -> USB Modem (CDC ACM) support (USB_ACM)"

==== Windows ====

FIXME

==== MacOS X ====
See the [[MacOS_X#USB_Serial|USB Serial section in the MacOS X article]].
