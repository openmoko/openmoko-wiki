==Presentation==
Qtmail is the mail application on om2008.8
==configuration for encrypted mail==
qtmail is already installed by default so we don't need to install it
but it doesn't support ssl/tls by default...so we will make it use ssl/tls
 cd /usr/lib
 ln -s libssl.so.0.9.7 libssl.so
 ln -s libcrypto.so.0.9.7 libcrypto.so
then we need to import our certificate...
I use no-log.org so the settings will be for it:
on your desktop computer do:
 openssl s_client -connect :143 -showcerts
copy the part between(and including ):
 -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
 -----END CERTIFICATE-----
put it in a file,that you will put on a folder,then do
 c_rehash /path/to/the/folder
then copy the content of the folder to /opt/Qtopia/etc/ssl/certs/

then it should work...you only need to configure it according to your mail provider settings
