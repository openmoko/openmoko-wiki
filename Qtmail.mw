{{Application|Qtmail}}

Qtmail is the default mail application on Om 2008.8. It is called ''Messages'' on the main screen. Qtmail supports POP3, IMAP, SMTP, SMS, MMS, EMS. 

== Basic setup ==

To send e-mail you need to set up at least one outgoing e-mail account. After this setup you can start sending e-mails from your Contacts list too.

* Start Messages
* Click Options and choose Account settings...
* Click Options and choose Add account...
* Configure your e-mail account and outgoing server settings

==Configuration for encrypted mail==

qtmail is already installed by default so we don't need to install it
but it doesn't support ssl/tls by default...so we will make it use ssl/tls
 cd /usr/lib
 ln -s libssl.so.0.9.7 libssl.so
 ln -s libcrypto.so.0.9.7 libcrypto.so
then we need to import our certificate...
change myprovider accorging to your settings:
on your desktop computer do:
 openssl s_client -connect myprovider:port -showcerts

examples:
*gmail:
**myprovider:imap.googlemail.com
**port:993
*yahoo
**myprovider:?
**port:?


copy the part between(and including ):
 -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
 -----END CERTIFICATE-----

you will need the c_rehash script, which is not in the OM repositories. as it is a perl script, it can be copied direct from your desktop/laptop. it will be in /usr/bin . copy it to the same location on your neo, ensure it is permitted to execute, then:

put it in a file,that you will put on a folder,then do
 c_rehash /path/to/the/folder
then copy the content of the folder to /opt/Qtopia/etc/ssl/certs/

then it should work...you only need to configure it according to your mail provider settings
