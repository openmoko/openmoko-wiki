One of good ways to get started developing is getting rootfs working on host machine, since most of us doesn't have real hardware.

Xoo is a graphical wrapper around Xnest, the nested X server. You can make Xnest look like a particular device's display and set up buttons on that device. This is useful for embedded developers who want to simulate a target device on their desktop machine.

Please see [[Getting OpenMoko working on host with Xephyr]] which might contain more up-to-date information.

== Getting rootfs ==
Use the [[MokoMakefile|Building OpenMoko using the MokoMakefile]] to get rootfs, just before make openmoko-devel-image run 
 # sed -i 's/fic-gta01/x86/' build/conf/local.conf
than just run make openmoko-devel-image. After a while(half of day) you should have in build/tmp/image/ file openmoko-devel-image-x86-$(DATE).rootfs.tar.gz mine is here [http://www.ms.mff.cuni.cz/~kupem6am/openmoko-devel-image-x86-20070227064250.rootfs.tar.gz].

=== Build issues ===

[http://bugzilla.openmoko.org/cgi-bin/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=264 Please see this bug tracker issues] if you have problems getting libelf compiled (do_stage fails).

== Install Xoo on your host ==
For gentoo users run just
 # emerge xoo
Debian/Ubuntu
 # sudo apt-get install xoo xnest
For Fedora (package has been submitted to Fedora for approval, see https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=236297):
 # ftp://ftp.xelerance.com/xoo/

for any other find a way how to do it in your distro.

== Making X cooperate ==
* Make sure your iptables do not prevent you from connecting to port 6000(x11) on localhost

* Make sure your X is listening on port 6000(X11) on localhost (netstat is friend)

* Enable conection from localhost
 # xhost localhost
== Preparing rootfs ==
* Unpack rootfs file in any directory and cd to that dir.

* Get dev files in rootfs
 # sudo mount --bind /dev/ rootfs/dev/

* Chroot to rootfs
 # sudo chroot rootfs /bin/sh
== Getting it up ==
In another term start xoo, good idea is to download [http://www.datenfreihafen.org/~stefan/OpenMoko/neo1973-xoo-device.tar.bz2] and run
 # xoo --device neo1973.xml
In chrooted enviroment export display to connect to started xoo
 # export DISPLAY=localhost:1.0
and start window manager.
 # x-window-manager
By this time you should have matchbox running in Xoo window.
