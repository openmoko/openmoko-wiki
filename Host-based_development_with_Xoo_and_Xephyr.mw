This page introduces you to the most efficient way to create new software for the Openmoko platform. Note that there is a VMware image where this environment has been prebuilt for you.
''Does anyone know where to find this VMWare image??''

==Host-based development==

This term means you develop most of your application in your standard desktop environment until it's almost finished. Then you can use a [[Toolchain]] to cross-compile your application for the Neo1973. Host-based development is incredibly more efficient since you can use your (typically) fast computer, large monitor, ... Compiling for your host also means that your edit-run-debug turnaround cycles are much faster, because you can skip the uploading-to-neo step.

==Xoo and Xephyr==
[http://projects.o-hand.com/xoo/ Xoo] is a GTK2 based graphical wrapper around a ‘Windowed’ X Server.  The X server is typically '''Xnest''', the nested X server, or [http://projects.o-hand.com/xephyr Xephyr].  It is intended for embedded developers that want to simulate a target device (with an '''accurate''' display size, working hardware buttons, etc) on a desktop machine. 

Note that Xoo is not required to simulate Openmoko hardware - it just improves the presentation.

==Prerequisites==

===Part I (precompiled software)===

You need to install some software that is usually not present on a desktop system, but used on the Neo1973. Some of this software has already been precompiled by your friendly distribution packager, so you don't need to compile it yourself. Most likely you can install the following packages from your distribution repository:

* gtk-doc-tools
* libstartup-notification0-dev
* libapm-dev
* libgpgme11-dev
* libgtk2.0-dev
* libebook1.2-dev
* libecal1.2-dev
* libnotify-dev
* libpulse-dev
* libcurl4-openssl-dev (or libcurl4-gnutls-dev)
* matchbox-window-manager
* matchbox-keyboard
* pulseaudio
* xephyr ( package is called xserver-xephyr on ubuntu and debian )
* xoo


Ubuntu-Specific Packages
* gnome-common (does this belong above?)
* ubuntu-mobile-dev (this depends on many other development packages; some are necessary, others optional)


Other Useful Packages
* libasound2-dev (needed to compile openmoko-dialer2 ([[User:Tomjoad]]))


Gentoo users run just
 # emerge <package>

''note'': To get the Xephyr package installed Gentoo users have to rebuild the x11-base/xorg-server package with the "kdrive" use flag enabled ([http://gentoo-wiki.com/Scratchbox#Xephyr_support link])


Debian/Ubuntu
 $ sudo apt-get install <package>
For Fedora, you can use
 # yum install <package>
For Mandriva, you may try
 # urpmi <package>

for any other find a way how to do it in your distro.

===Part II (building from source)===

You also need some software that is typically not found in your distribution repository, either because it's too new, too specific, or unheard of.

Most likely you will need to compile the following packages for your distribution:

* matchbox-panel-2
* libjana
* libipkg

To compile and install matchbox-panel-2:

 mkdir -f /local/pkg/ohand
 cd /local/pkg/ohand
 svn co http://svn.o-hand.com/repos/matchbox/trunk matchbox
 cd matchbox/matchbox-panel-2
 ./autogen.sh
 make
 sudo make install

To compile and install libjana:

 mkdir -f /local/pkg/ohand
 cd /local/pkg/ohand
 svn co http://svn.o-hand.com/repos/jana/trunk jana
 cd jana
 ./autogen.sh
 make
 sudo make install

To compile and install libipkg:

 mkdir -f /local/pkg/handhelds.org
 cd /local/pkg/handhelds.org
 wget http://downloads.openmoko.org/developer/sources/ipkg-0.99.163.tar.gz
 tar xzf ipkg-0.99.163.tar.gz
 cd ipkg-0.99.163
 ./configure
 make
 sudo make install

==Building the Openmoko core==

First we download the Openmoko subversion repository:

  mkdir -f /local/pkg/openmoko
  cd /local/pkg/openmoko
  svn co http://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/src src

Then you compile the software contained there, e.g. you will definitely want to compile at least:

In directory src/target/:
* [http://svnweb.openmoko.org/trunk/src/target/gsm/ gsmd]
* [http://svnweb.openmoko.org/trunk/src/target/opkg/ opkg]

In directory src/target/OM-2007.2/artwork:

* [http://svnweb.openmoko.org/trunk/src/target/OM-2007.2/libraries/libmokojournal2/ libmokojournal2]
* [http://svnweb.openmoko.org/trunk/src/target/OM-2007.2/libraries/libmokogsmd2/ libmokogsmd2]

In directory src/target/OM-2007.2/daemons/:

In directory src/target/OM-2007.2/panel-plugins/:

* [http://svnweb.openmoko.org/trunk/src/target/OM-2007.2/panel-plugins/openmoko-panel-bt/ openmoko-panel-bt]

In directory src/target/OM-2007.2/applications:
* [http://svnweb.openmoko.org/trunk/src/target/OM-2007.2/applications/openmoko-today2/ openmoko-today2]
* [http://svnweb.openmoko.org/trunk/src/target/OM-2007.2/applications/openmoko-dialer2/ openmoko-dialer2]
* [http://svnweb.openmoko.org/trunk/src/target/OM-2007.2/applications/openmoko-calculator2/ openmoko-calculator2]
* [http://svnweb.openmoko.org/trunk/src/target/OM-2007.2/applications/openmoko-appmanager2/ openmoko-appmanager2]

Each of these packages can be compiled with the well-known-triple of:

 ./configure (or ./autogen.sh, if it's the first time)
 make
 make install

==Data files==

Some of the data files are not yet installed. We will create links so that Openmoko finds the data files and uses them directly from the svn directories that you have checked out. To create the links:

  mkdir /usr/local/share/matchbox
  cd /usr/local/share/matchbox
  sudo ln -s /local/pkg/openmoko/src/target/OM-2007.2/misc/openmoko-today2-folders vfolders

  cd /usr/share/themes
  sudo ln -s /local/pkg/openmoko/src/target/OM-2007.2/artwork/themes/openmoko-standard-2

==Starting the nested Openmoko==

We have prepared a script for you that starts Xoo and all the necessary X clients in one run. The script is online at 
* [http://svnweb.openmoko.org/trunk/src/host/xoo/om-launch om-launch]
