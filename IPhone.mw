Native software can only be created by unauthorized hacking ([http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/01/12/0430200&from=rss Source]); Apple's official answer is that their web browser has very good AJAX support and that apps should use that. As of March 6 2008, Apple offers an official native SDK ([http://developer.apple.com/iphone/ on Apple's website], with registration), but applications developed with it run only in a sandbox and are limited in API they can use.
