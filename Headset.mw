There's a four-ring 2.5mm stereo jack which provides connectivity to old-fashioned wired headsets.

The headsets used by Motorola smartphones (A780,A1200, ...) and the V-360 have a compatible configuration.

The headsets used by some Nokia phones (N95, ...) have the same jack but they are incompatible. For technical information about rewiring them visit [[Analog wired Headset Nokia]].

|Â Koss KSC-35 headphones, Altec Lansing inMotion iM4 speakers and car audio via AUX - all work great, if the mixer settings are changed like guided below. One can notice the lack of real quality sound with the headphones, but it's mostly fine for any casual listening. Definitely the output is not ideal/natural because of the high-pass filtering effect from the hardware issue and then artificially boosting low frequencies to compensate.

You probably want to fix mixer settings to overcome the poor low-frequency output, see [[FreeRunner Hardware Issues#Known.2FAccepted_Issues|FreeRunner Hardware Issues]] for instructions.
