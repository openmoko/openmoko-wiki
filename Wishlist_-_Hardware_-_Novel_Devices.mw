This page details hardware some would like in future OpenMoko devices that are very different from the [[Neo1973]]. DVD/media players, cameras, ...

=== Hard Drive ===
Providing a hard drive, will allow storing music, movies, etc. Add USB storage device capability to use the device as an external hard drive.

=== OpenMoko-branded modem card ===

A 3G modem card for use with other computing hardware, in particular PCs. Probably an internal expansion card such as an ExpressCard or Compact Flash card, with an alternative external (USB) unit for computers without internal slots. (In fact, a PCI-factor internal card for desktop computers might be reasonable too; see below.)

There are already CardBus and external USB 3G modems available. In hardware terms, OpenMoko's modem could well be a simple rebranding of one of these existing products. But, at least in some areas, the 3G modem products available to end-users tend to be tied to a particular telco and bundled with that telco's software. They also have a mysterious tendency not to actually allow voice calls over the modem, even when the modem hardware appears to be quite capable of it. An OpenMoko modem that simply provided open drivers, no lock to a particular telco, good support for various operating systems, and simple support for voice and video calls over the modem, all out of the box, would already have some fairly unique selling points. (Since video conferencing is now taking off on personal computers, hardware that allows your desktop computer to make video calls to 3G mobile phones might well have a market, which is one reason why a PCI-factor card might not be so crazy.)

But more than that, any software or services that OpenMoko develops to overcome the tricky problems of juggling and integrating different Internet and phone connections and different email, IM, VoIP and telephone-number identities on Internet-enabled phones would be available to users of the OpenMoko modem too. That would be a powerful selling point for the modem if and when OpenMoko has compelling solutions to these problems. In fact, the increased integration with PCs would make all OpenMoko devices more attractive. ("Whenever I'm logged in to my laptop all my calls go there, even when I'm not in range of WiFi.")

Since [[FIC]] already has well-established relationships in the PC world, it could presumably make good use of those connections in selling the modems.

* Obviously the OpenMoko modem faces much the same problems with getting reasonably open access to 3G hardware that are delaying 3G for the [[Neo1973]] series 

* Naturally a 3G Neo1973 or other OpenMoko phone would (or should) be able to provide many of the same advantages when acting as a modem for a PC. But there will still be a place for dedicated modems, if only because yoking a full mobile phone to your computer isn't always the best solution 

* Just like full phones, modems would benefit from support for multiple SIMs (see [[Wish_List_-_Hardware#Ability_to_use_multiple_SIMs.2Fnetworks]]) if they're going to be used for (non-VoIP) voice

* Bonus points if the hardware provides a POTS landline connection and the software can juggle it along with 3G and Internet connections...

=== PCMCIA slot ===
Extensibility would be nice. Standard pcmcia would be great for allowing wireless too. And pcmcia cards tend to be very low power.
*1. can be used for a spare battery (is this possible?)
*3. i can use my [http://www.echoaudio.com/Products/CardBus/IndigoIO/index.php Echo Audio Indigo I/O]
*2. can be used for different cards around

This is certain not to happen in a production phone, it's simply far too large, and requires complex support in hardware, which does not exist in most system on a chip devices as are used in phones. 
Even for the [[Expansion_Back]] it would be too large. --[[User:Speedevil|Speedevil]] 06:05, 28 February 2007 (CET)

== Cameras & Imaging ==
==== See [[Wish_List_-_Hardware#Camera]] for additional/updated info on camera suggestions ====
=== Interchangeable Camera Lenses ===

A camera phone with a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_mount lens mount] would allow swappable camera lenses and filters.  Camera phones are usually stuck with tiny fixed lenses that don't allow focusing.  Imaging being able to swap out the default lens with one that provides a better focus... or even a zoom!  

The C-Mount or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-mount T-Mount] would be a good choice.  Both are standard lens mount with many supporting lenses.  Minolta, Canon, Nikon, Olympus, & most other lens manufacturers also have [http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/shop/300/Lens_Adapters_Mounts.html mount adapters] for their proprietary lenses. Then share lenses between your camera & cell phone.  The mount hole would need to be about 1 inch in diameter and go about 1/4 inch into the camera-phone (with the focal plane array chip at the bottom of this hole).

CS-Mount would actually be better than a c mount because it requires 12.52mm from surface to imaging chip, instead of the 17.52mm required for c mounts.

 '''Added bonus If you work somewhere that doesn't allow cameras:'''
 The lens could be removed and a blank insert could be screwed in.
 The camera capability would be physically disabled!

=== Business Card Reader ===
This is probably technically difficult if not impossible, maybe you could do it with the embedded camera hardware & software

I want to be able to place a business card face down on the the screen, and have the device automatically read the card and enter the info in the contacts.
* There is no simple way of reading something placed on the screen, for the basic reason that the screen is in the way.
* Of course you could always just take a picture of the card with a camera-phone.  Then store it as it is or image recognition software could do character recognition & extract the information.

=== Solar Panels ===
My old pocket calculator had solar panels, why not my phone?
See also: [[Expansion_Back#Ideas which require slight modifications of the phone.]]

Here is my Solar Panel Mod for the Neo1973(GTA01)

May be not so bad idea when you are somewhere in mountains and cannot easily charge the battery. This may at least prolong the battery life. [[User:AudriusA|AudriusA]] 17:56, 12 July 2008 (UTC)

=== Fuel Cell ===
Some people want to put them in laptops & fuel cells are the way of the future.

===TV Out===
With help of mouse and keyboard, a TV output may be very useful.
Or to watch photos taken with a digital camera on holidays.
Or for showing a slide presentation off.


=== Larger Screen ===

A model with a larger screen would be of use to many, especially with multi-touch. Higher resolution is probably less important than size until the DPI drops below 150 or so.


=== Tiny Video Projector - "Beamer" ===

At the [http://www.sid.org/conf/sid2007/sid2007.html DisplayWeek2007] several embeded video projectors for phones were presented. 
 Those projecting devices are not much bigger than a cell phone. A LED-laser projects a sharp image at variable distance
Could such a device be connected by bluetooth?
 [http://www.explay.co.il/ Explay] uses two a red and a green laser-LED as well as a conventional blue LED in its "oio".
 Blue laser-LED are to expensive for customer products. The light passes a transmissive WVGA-LCD(640x480) and goes on 
 to the screen. Its frequency is 60Hz and the projecting distance can be varied from 20cm(8inch) to 2m(80inch) with 
 a sharp picture. It consumes about 5W and its light power is about 6 lumen. As the sharpness does not depend on
 distance, one can project the image on screens that are not plane. Like someones t-shirt.

 [http://www.microvision.com/ Microvistions] PicoProjektor however uses soley laser-LEDs. It is also 60Hz though 800x600px or 800x640.

 Potential problems might become the approval of a laser class 3 device.

 Final prices could be about $300.

===HMD===
Possibility to use something like [http://www.aeinnovations.com/projects/ver0/ Eyeglass Mounted Display].

Or a HUD for use in a car windscreen. Needs a small projector attached to the phone. The phone is placed in front of the steering wheel on the console and displays information projected against the windscreen.

===Multi I/O adapter===
*VGA, standard Jack (line in & out), standard USB

===Credit Card Swiper/Reader===
*A credit card swipe function on the device, so that business operators can use the device to accept payments. In some markets a 'chip+pin' card reader may be an alternative. Existing devices are very expensive. Transaction information is sent over the internet, transaction "hub" services like 1stData could receive the data and reply with email receipts to the merchant, who could then forward the receipt to customer's email, or print a receipt on a bluetooth printer.

===Modular hardware design / interchangeable components===
It would be great to have several interchangeable components on the 'bus' of the device. Imagine opening the case and being able to add GPS to an empty internal bay or swap an Accelerometer for 3G support.  
Similar to the PCI hardware model of desktop PCs -- let savvy users swap and upgrade internal components by intentionally designing swappable components on some standardized bus.

 Unfortunately, this is a big problem for compact devices.
 To take the above examples. An accelerometer module may be 5mm*5mm*2mm. 
 A 3G module 50mm*30mm*10mm, a GSM module 30mm*40mm*5mm and a GPS module 20mm*15mm*5mm. 
 Apart from the wasted space problems, this means also that each module has to be custom-built for FIC. 
 Then there is a second part - you have to have connectors and some way to clamp the module in place.
 
 This adds yet more weight and volume.

==Unsorted==

===Virtual laser keyboard===
see...
http://www.virtual-laser-keyboard.com/?an=google


== Different Shapes & Styles ==
==== See [[Wish_List_-_Hardware#Casing]] for case suggestions & case mods ==== 
The current shape is great and many people love it (and I myself plan on getting one).  Still, different strokes for different folks & we're allowed to muse about other options.


===Dump the '''''egg-shaped''''' case design and go '''''rectangular''''' for more screen space===
*I'm all for devices that look great and have great features - aside from that I really like the current design. Thus I'd like to comment that the design change request is probably not the majority's opinion. [[User:Abraxa|Abraxa]] 00:00, 18 February 2007 (CET)

There will be many OpenMoko devices, of different designs. --[[User:Speedevil|Speedevil]] 06:19, 28 February 2007 (CET)


===Clamshell===
Nuff said

===Twisting top===
Perfect for a multi-directional camera phone (for easier self photos & video conferencing)<br />
[[Image:Kg920phone.jpg]]<br />

===Alcohol Sensor===
Alcohol sensor adjacent to microphone.  It doesn't have to be accurate, just has to detect any amount of alcohol on the speaker's breath.  I understand this is a very narrow market, but alcohol is on every parent's mind.

I think those who drive cars might profit from this feature too. --[[User:Cedel|cedel]] 16:02, 20 February 2007 (CET)

:Although this is a good idea, you have to be very careful about liability here. If it gives a false positive (i.e. you're not over the limit), and you have an accident, the OpenMoko team might be liable.

::I guess the good alcohol sensor is very expensive, cheap very often give false outcome. However, they more often produce negative (no alcohol) while there is. And there's still the thing about guilt OpenMoko team would bear. --[[User:Tolein|tolein]] 18:01, 1 October 2007 (GMT+1)

===Bottle opener===
* including a bottle opener is very hard, but could be useful.
* [http://www.bokonzept.de/php/images/462.jpg example]
* It definitely is useful. A metal reinforced corner might be enough. While it is possible to open bottles with most cell phones, they don't look too good after opening a few cases.
* Every multi-tool has to have a cork screw

==Stackable Back Expansion plates==
A reference specification for creating add-on devices. The phone has a back where other backs can be added and removed as the user desires depending on the function needed at the time supplied by each back expansion device. 
A USB 2.0 port which can use all usb devices such as a USB Storage or a Printer Etc.
:Great idea, however it would require some other port, not USB. It should be thin, so it wouldn't take much space "inside" phone, and also should let you spin the add-on device, so it should be circular. --[[User:Tolein|tolein]] 18:02, 1 October 2007 (GMT+1)
