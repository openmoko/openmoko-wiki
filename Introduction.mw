OpenMoko is an attempt to create the world's first completely open mobile phone software stack.

We believe in standardization bottom-up (defined and implemented by the community), instead of top-down (defined by a consortium).

For a more thorough introduction see [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/announce/2007-January/000000.html this announcement]

OpenMoko is supposed to run on all kinds of Linux-capable mobile phones. The first fully supported OpenMoko phone is the FIC Neo1973.

This initative has been initiated by [[FIC|FIC Inc.]] and [http://www.openmoko.com OpenMoko, Inc.]
