::FIXME: Write short introduction here, make few images, ... just short briefing for anybody who came for the first time, no details, no specifications. 

"The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave
themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are
indistinguishable from it."

Mark Weiser wrote those words almost 15 years ago in a Scientific
American article titled, "The Computer for the 21st Century." In it, he
coined the term "ubiquitous computing", and proposed a set of ground
rules for  devices of the 21st century.

Temporally, we're here. Technologically, we're close. But everyone
still seems to be talking about ubiquitous computing like a mirage on
desert road: it's always the same distance away. Sometimes looking at
common every day objects with a fresh perspective yields interesting
new ideas.  Today we're going to propose that the foundation for
ubiquitous computing is already here. All that is stopping us from
going forward is change of context.

Almost everyone we know has a mobile phone. Mobile phones have become
part of the fabric of everyday life. Does this mean that the mobile
phone is  the ubiquitous computing device we've all waited for?
Currently, no. But with a subtle change we would argue, yes.

Mobile phones are closed environments created with a mobile context in
mind.  But this concept is limiting; a mobile phone has the potential
to be a platform that can do anything that a small computer with
broadband access can do. If mobile phones were based on open platforms,
they would have the potential to bring computing to people in a ways
traditional computers cannot. Mobile phones can become ubiquitous
computers.

Ubiquitous computing, however, does not simply mean computers that can
be carried to work, to the home, to the beach, and to the movies.
Ubiquitous computers must know where they are, and then must be able to
merge into the environment.

We put GPS functionality into the Neo1973, because when your phone
simply knows its location, it can adapt its behavior in significant
ways without even a hint of artificial intelligence.

How can devices disappear into the background? To be honest, we have
far more questions than answers here. But do we know what is needed for
exploring this idea. Developers must have unrestricted access to
hardware at all times.  Being able to control the microphone, for
example, will allow phones to sense ambient noise. A simple program
could prevent your phone from ringing while you're in a conversation.

We will always try our absolute best to give you devices that are as
open as possible. Our goal is freeing end-users and businesses alike
from proprietary constraints. We're about encouraging people to modify
and personalize their software to support their individual needs.
Building products as we do, we strive to enable people to connect and
communicate in new and relevant ways, using their own languages and
their own symbols.

Our company is unconventional, We openly share our roadmap. And today
we're going to share it with you. (Hopefully, by now, there isn't a
single person left on this list who thinks we're conventional ;-)

Your participation, in terms of actual code, hardware features,
suggestions, and usage-scenarios will shape product features of our
roadmap.

It is based on ...
