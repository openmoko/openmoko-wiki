Openmoko is a project to create mobile phones with an open software stack.

'''Openmoko Inc releases hardware''': phones to run the open source software stack. The first phone was the [[Neo 1973]], followed by the current model, [[Neo FreeRunner]]. Users may freely choose to run another operating system on their Openmoko smartphone -- please see [[Distributions]] to learn more.

'''Openmoko Inc releases software''': the operating system and applications for the Openmoko phones. The current software stack is the [[Om 2008.8]]. Newly purchased Neo FreeRunners, however, still ship with the older stack [[Om 2007.2]]. Openmoko runs on all kinds of [[Supported Hardware|Linux-capable mobile phones]] or in an [[Openmoko_under_QEMU|emulator]].

'''Free your phone''' mission allows users to customize the phone platform to their needs, modify existing software, and create or install any additional software. With [http://www.freesmartphone.org freesmartphone.org], Openmoko is working on a stable system services software back-end; freesmartphone.org is a collaboration platform for open source and open discussion software projects working on interoperability and shared technology for Linux-based smartphones. This [[OpenmokoFramework]] will be used in forthcoming Openmoko distributions.

The  - base of the Openmoko software stack - 
The Openmoko project has been initiated by FIC Inc and [http://www.openmoko.com Openmoko, Inc.]

The Openmoko stack, which includes a full X server, allows users and developers to transform mobile hardware platforms into unique products. Our license gives developers and users freedom to cosmetically customize their device or radically remix it; change the wallpaper or rebuild the entire house! It grants them the freedom, for example, to transform a phone into a medical device or point of sale device or the freedom to simply install their own favorite software. Beyond freeing the software on our devices we have also released our [http://downloads.openmoko.org/CAD/ CAD] files. And at LinuxWorld 2008, we announced the release of the [http://downloads.openmoko.org/schematics/ schematics for our products].
