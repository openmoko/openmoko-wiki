Openmoko is a project to create mobile phones with an open software stack.

We believe in standardization bottom-up (defined and implemented by the community), instead of top-down (defined by a consortium).

For a more thorough introduction see [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/announce/2007-January/000000.html this announcement]

Openmoko is supposed to run on all kinds of Linux-capable mobile phones. The first fully supported Openmoko phones are the [[Neo 1973]] and [[Neo FreeRunner]].

This initative has been initiated by [[FIC|FIC Inc.]] and [http://www.openmoko.com Openmoko, Inc.]
