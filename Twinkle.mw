'''{{Note|This is particulary trivial for the Debian distribution.}}'''

[http://www.twinklephone.com/ Twinkle] is a Voice over IP ( VoIP ) application. Its purpose is to make phone calls via the Internet, instead of using the telephony network. Here is a way to get the command line twinkle working on Debian.

===Debian and QtMoko===
<pre>
apt-get install twinkle
</pre>

It will install some dependencies (about 83.0 MB for me) but after Twinkle have the advantage to be quite ergonomic and lightweight! (about 15MB in memory)

If you have some trouble to change some settings like the sound, you can modify it by editing the file ~/.twinkle/twinkle.sys
for example, alsa:
<pre>
# AUDIO
dev_ringtone=alsa:default
dev_speaker=alsa:default
dev_mic=alsa:default
validate_audio_dev=yes
au_reduce_noise_mic=yes
alsa_play_period_size=128
alsa_capture_period_size=32
oss_fragment_size=128
</pre>

You will probably need to switch between some profil of sound!:
 # alsactl -f /usr/share/openmoko/scenarios/voip-handset.state restore

At the end of the utilisation you switch back using:
 # alsactl -f /usr/share/openmoko/scenarios/stereoout.state restore
{{Note|<b>([[QtMoko]])</b> If you encouter the problem that you have not enough memory on QtMoko to install Twinkle, you can delete some of the installed deb-package from directory 
   <tt> /var/cache/apt/archives</tt> 
and store them on 
   <tt>/media/card/archive</tt> 
(create directory if necessary)}}
