'''{{Note|This is particulary trivial for the Debian distribution.}}'''

Twinkle is a Voice over IP ( VoIP ) application. Its purpose is to make phone calls via the Internet, instead of using the telephony network. Here is a way to get the command line twinkle working on Debian.

<pre>
apt-get install twinkle
</pre>

It will install some dependencies (about 83.0 Mo for me) but after Twinkle have the advantage to be quite ergonomic and lightweight!(about 15Mo in memory)

If you have some truble to change some settings like the sound, you can modify it by editing the file ~/.twinkle/twinkle.sys
for example, alsa:
<pre>
# AUDIO
dev_ringtone=alsa:default
dev_speaker=alsa:default
dev_mic=alsa:default
validate_audio_dev=yes
au_reduce_noise_mic=yes
alsa_play_period_size=128
alsa_capture_period_size=32
oss_fragment_size=128
</pre>
