An annoying buzz which only the person you are talking to can hear has been an issue with the [[GTA02]].  It has been discussed in several posts on the community mailing list. One early one is here [http://lists.openmoko.org/nabble.html#nabble-td1509627|a1509627]. There is a fix for it, but it requires highly technical hardware skills.  The file [http://people.openmoko.org/joerg/GSM_EMI_noise/big-C_rework_SOP_rc2.pdf big-C_rework_SOP_rc2.pdf], which describes the soldering required to fix the buzz, can be found here [http://people.openmoko.org/joerg/GSM_EMI_noise/] as can a user's post of their result, here [http://anyotherkey.googlepages.com/c].  

[[OpenMoko]] has a program offering the big-C rework for owners of the model A5 and A6 FreeRunners in [http://sdgsystems.com/estore/cart.php?target=product&product_id=269&category_id=17 the United States] and [http://www.handheld-linux.com/wiki.php?page=Buzz-Rework the EU].  Please see [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2009-June/049106.html the mailing list announcement] for more details.  The A7 model includes the Big-C rework by default.  

Note that the "Big C" buzz fix only fixes the internal microphone; a wired headset mic will still cause buzz [http://lists.openmoko.org/nabble.html#nabble-td2509041].  A bluetooth headset may be one solution.
