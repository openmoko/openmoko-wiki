GSM buzz has been an issue with GTA02, it has been discussed in several posts on the community mailing list. One early one is here [http://lists.openmoko.org/nabble.html#nabble-td1509627|a1509627]. 

The big-C_rework_SOP_rc2.pdf can be found here [http://people.openmoko.org/joerg/GSM_EMI_noise/] as can a user's post of their result, from here [http://anyotherkey.googlepages.com/c]

Openmoko will support those offering a diy and encourage hardware volunteers. Fix it / buzz fix parties have been taking place.

There is still a problem though, as the wired mic causes buzz [http://lists.openmoko.org/nabble.html#nabble-td2509041]

A bluetooth headset may be one solution.
