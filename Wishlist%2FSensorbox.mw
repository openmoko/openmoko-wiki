During out SYSTEMS fair presentation, an idea was born: an external sensor box!

There is an initial discussion (in German):

== Features ==
* analog sensors
* connected as USB (host)
* battery extender (?)

== Sensors ==
* Temperature
* Humidity
* Barometer
* Magnetic compass
* Light intensity / Colorimeter
* Laser / Ultrasonic distance
* Voltmeter / Simple Oscilloscope (?)

== Other proposed extensions ==
These ideas go beyond the original Sensorbox idea but some of them can be easily added:
* LED lamp
* GPS Antenna
* Battery pack
* Camera
* USB Hub
* RJ45

== Mechanics ==
There is currently some discussion if it should be a Jacket or an external box.

== Electronics ==
* a low cost, low power single chip processor with USB and ca. 8 x ADC (which one? Please go to discussion page)
* power comes through USB
* USB A/f so that the standard client cable can be connected

== Software ==
* Device is addressed as a simple serial interface over USB
* allows to switch on/off each sensor (so that power drainage can be controlled)
* sends every 0.1 seconds a data block with latest data values
* User-Interface runs on the Freerunner
