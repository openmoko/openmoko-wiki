* analog sensors
* connected as USB (host)
* battery extender (?)

== Sensors ==
* Temperature

* Light intensity / Color
* Laser / Ultrasonic distance
* Voltmeter (?)

== Other proposed extensions ==
* pocket lamp

== Electronics ==
* should be a PIC with USB and 8 x ADC
* power comes through USB
* USB A plug (?)

== Software ==
* Device is addressed as a simple serial interface over USB
* allows to switch on/off each sensor (so that power drainage can be controlled)
* sends every 0.1 seconds a data block with latest data values
* User-Interface runs on the Freerunner
