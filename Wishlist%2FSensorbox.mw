During out SYSTEMS fair presentation, an idea was born: an external sensor box!

There is an initial discussion (in German):

http://freeyourphone.de/portal_v1/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=661&p=6966#p6966

== Features ==
* analog sensors
* connected as USB (host)
* battery extender (?)

== Sensors ==
* Temperature
* Humidity
* Barometer
* magnetic compass
* Light intensity / Color
* Laser / Ultrasonic distance
* Voltmeter (?)

== Other proposed extensions ==
These ideas go beyond the original Sensorbox idea but some of them can be easily added:
* LED lamp
* GPS Antenna
* Battery pack
* Camera
* USB Hub
* RJ45

== Mechanics ==
There is currently some discussion if it should be a Jacket or an external box.

== Electronics ==
* a PIC with USB and 8 x ADC (which one, link??)
** Please use the ARM processor (32bit address space) - it has no [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_switching Bank switching]; ARM has a big linear directly addressable memory. Can get flashed by this open source tool: [http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/lpc21isp/ lpc21isp], [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/lpc21isp/files/ yahoo download (after user registration)].
*** Look e.g. on the cheap LPC214x (LPC2144-LPC2148 has 14 ADC multiplexed channels - two internal ADCs). Chip price: [http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?Detail?name=568-1763-ND digikey.com: LPC2144 US$ 8.4], [http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?Detail?name=568-1765-ND LPC2148 US$ 11.2]. The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture ARM architecture] is "old" (from 1983), wildly known, used, efficient(high mips/watt) and uses low power (different kind of deep sleep).
***Test/development/production boards:
****USB powered through USB-flash port, only mentions 2 ADC-ports: [http://www.embeddedartists.com/products/education/edu_2148.php embeddedartists.com: LPC2148 Education Board] (two USB ports - one for programming via a ftdi-chip(USB<->serial) - and one directly connected to LPC2148)
****[http://www.mikrocontroller.net/articles/ARM_MP3/AAC_Player ARM MP3/AAC Player] Quote: "...This is my MP3/AAC player project. The difference to most other players is that decoding is not done on a specialized IC (like VS1001), but directly on the microcontroller. It can play MP3 (all bit rates) and AAC (up to ~256 kbps) from SD card in real time. The project is work in progress..."

* power comes through USB
* USB A/f so that the standard client cable can be connected

== Software ==
* Device is addressed as a simple serial interface over USB
* allows to switch on/off each sensor (so that power drainage can be controlled)
* sends every 0.1 seconds a data block with latest data values
* User-Interface runs on the Freerunner
