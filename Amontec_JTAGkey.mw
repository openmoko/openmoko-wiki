The Amontec JTAGkey is a USB to JTAG adaptor sold by the [http://www.amontec.com/ Swiss company, Amontec].  [http://www.amontec.com/ Amontec] also offer a very inexpensive variant called JTAGkey Tiny, which is more or less the same hardware, but without level shifters. This means that low-voltage signals might not be picked up. 

However, on the [[:Category:Neo1973 Hardware | Neo1973 Hardware]], the JTAG voltage is 3.3Volts, so no level shifter is required, and the JTAGkey Tiny can be used.

Please note that encourage using the new official [[Debug Board]] over other JTAG boards.
