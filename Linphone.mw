Linphone is a Voice over IP ( VoIP ) application. Its purpose is to make phone calls via the Internet, instead of using the telephony network. Here is a way to get the command line linphone working on OE based distros (tested on Qtopia, but should work on 200x.x and others). Ideally this could be interfaced with the dialer somehow.

<pre>
echo "src/gz celtune http://rabenfrost.net/celtune/ipk/armv4t" >/etc/opkg/general-feed.conf
opkg update
opkg install libmediastreamer0
opkg -nodeps install linphone
opkg -nodeps install liblinphone2 linphonec linphone-rings
opkg install libexosip2

cd /etc/
wget http://www.koolu.org/asound.conf
wget http://www.koolu.org/voip-handset.state

alsactl -f voip-handset.state restore # This step required to set proper audio parameters

linphonec
soundcard use 0
proxy add
</pre>

<pre>
''Enter proxy sip address:'' sip:sip.provider.com
''Your identity for this proxy:'' sip:xxxxxxxxxx@sip.provider.com
''Do you want to register on this proxy (yes/no):'' yes
''Specify register expiration time in seconds (default is 600):''
''Expiration:'' 600 seconds or so
</pre>

Initial testing of this had the audio routed properly through the earpiece and good audio from the microphone. There was some echo on the non-Freerunner side, and on initial connection, a bit of a beeping sound. Otherwise, it's a go. Linphone uses only about 10-12% CPU (was using a PCM codec). Sound was decent to a cell phone in Canada using a Wifi connected Freerunner based in Costa Rica.

Here is a quick and dirty how-to. Enhancements can be made to both the voip-handset.state and asound.conf files (these were my initial working scripts). Thanks to Celtune for the excellent repository that is used below.

If you want to avoid installing linphone you can use the [[FDOM]] image. This includes the linphone installation. You just have to enter your sip-account details.
