==Official case schematics==

Openmoko has released the CAD files for the case schematics for the OpenMoko [[Neo1973]] (GTA01) and Neo FreeRunner. These are available in the original Pro/E (.asm/.prt) format and alternative formats created from the originals.

We welcome your assistance in providing other formats. If you are able to convert CAD files from Pro/E format to other formats, please contact [mailto:michael@openmoko.org]. We are especially interested in the DXF format and in images rendered from these files.
