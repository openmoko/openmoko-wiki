==Official case schematics==

Openmoko has released the CAD files for the case schematics for the OpenMoko [[Neo1973]] (GTA01) and Neo FreeRunner. These are available in the original Pro/E (.asm/.prt) format and alternative formats created from the originals.

We welcome your assistance in providing other formats. If you are able to convert CAD files from Pro/E format to other formats, please contact [mailto:michael@openmoko.org]. We are especially interested in the DXF format and in images rendered from these files.

==Artistic Renderings==

A basic 3D rendering has been created for ''artistic'' use.  It has also been used to make a short *.mov animation in '''Art of Illusion'''.  Feel free to edit it to conceptually illustrate case ideas or provide more exact measurements so we can refine the model.
