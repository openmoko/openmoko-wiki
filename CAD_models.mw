Openmoko has released the CAD files for the [[Neo 1973]] and [[Neo FreeRunner]]. These are available in the original Pro/E (.asm/.prt) format and have also been converted to IGES and STEP formats.

We welcome your assistance in providing other formats. If you are able to convert CAD files from Pro/E format to other formats, please contact [mailto:michael@openmoko.org]. We are especially interested in the DXF format and in images rendered from these files.

= Questions =

What free software can be used to read these files? Is BRL-CAD the only one? Could somebody who knows how to use BRL-CAD record a short (2 minutes) introduction video?
