=Files=

Openmoko has [http://openmoko.com/download-cad.html released the CAD files] for the [[Neo 1973]] and [[Neo FreeRunner]] under [http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8117 Creative Commons BY-SA license]. These are available in the original Pro/ENGINEER (.asm and.prt) format and have also been converted to IGES (.igs) and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Step_file STEP] (.stp) formats.


We welcome your assistance in providing other formats. If you are able to convert CAD files from Pro/E format to other formats, please contact [mailto:michael@openmoko.org]. We are especially interested in the DXF format and in images rendered from these files.

=Software=
The following software is able to deal with these files containing the CAD models.

== Pro/ENGINEER==
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProEngineer Pro/ENGINEER] Wildfire 3.0 has been used originally to design the models. Note that this is proprietary software. See also [http://www.ptc.com/products/proengineer/ official site]

==gCAD3D==
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCAD3D gCAD3D] is able to import the IGES and STEP files. This is free and open source software. See also [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/158249 Ubuntu package request].

An easy way to get started is to instal gCAD3D in /opt/ as /opt/gCAD3D/ and in its /opt/gCAD3D/dat/ directory make a symbolic link to the unpacked Neo_FreeRunner_GTA02_casing directory. Then start from /opt/gCAD3D/ the application with ./gCAD3D and via 'Open Model' in the 'File' menu you are able to select NEW-DIR and go to the step or iges directory and select either load gta02-mme01_asm.stp or gta02-mme01_asm.igs. While doing this, gCAD3D will something about DIR-1, simply click 'yes'. Note that both imports are done differently and both have their own particular buffer overflow errors. Try them both from a freshly started gCAD3D.

Loading the models will take some time, just let the application do its thing. Please improve these instructions when possible or contribute to the packaging process of this software for Ubuntu.

==VariCAD

VariCAD viewer is free to use, however VariCAD draw application is available in a trial version for one month or can be purchased for longer use.
