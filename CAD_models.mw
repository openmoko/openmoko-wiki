Schematics of the existing case/internals have been requested from FIC, but this will take some time, so for the time being the existing case will need to be measured and schematics uploaded here by an owner of a Neo1973.
Even though we don't have schematics or accurate dimensions, a basic 3D rendering has been created for artistic use.  It has also been used to make a short *.mov animation in '''Art of Illusion'''.  Feel free to edit it to conceptually illustrate case ideas or provide more exact measurements so we can refine the model.
