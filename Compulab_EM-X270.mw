The EM-X270 is an embedded computer board, produced by [http://www.compulab.co.il/x270em/html/x270-em-datasheet.htm  Compulab], an Israel-based company specialising in Single Board Computers (SBC). The board has a range of optional components which can be specified for full mobile phone capabilities, and more (to a level similar to that of the [[Neo1973]]), as detailed below:

=Main components=

==Touchscreen==
3.5" VGA (640x480)

==Processor==
Intel Xscale PXA270, 312/520MHz

==System memory==
128MB SDRAM, 100MHz, 32bit

==Onboard storage==
===NOR memory===
4MB, non-volatile (generally for uBoot or other bootloader)

===NAND memory===
128MB - 512MB , non-volatile (generally for majority of the OS/applications/user files)

==Operating System==
===uBoot===

===Angstrom Linux===
[[http://www.compulab.co.il/x270em/download more info]]

==Connectivity==
===GSM/GPRS===
Quad-band Telit GE864 module

===WiFi===
802.11b with a Philips chipset<br>
Not yet supported by Linux (planned for December)

===Bluetooth===
Bluetooth v2.0 + EDR

===GPS===
Navman Jupiter 32 [[http://www.navman.com/Documents/OEM_docs/Jupiter%2032/LA000267D_Jupiter32_DataSheet.pdf Data Sheet]], with NMEA output

==Battery==
Li-Ion, charged over USB

==Peripheral connectivity==
===SD socket, with SDIO capability===

===USB===
USB 1.1, with host and slave capabilities

===Serial port===
RS232, 16550 compatible

===GPIO===
up to 16 dedicated lines, shared with keypad (if present)

===Camera interface===
Support for adding a digital still (up to 2048 x 2048)/video camera (15fps, vga).

=Availability=
==Modules==
Compulab has a strict sales policy: only to companies, only in large quantities, only if one evaluation board is bought

=Dimensions (including battery and screen)=
Size: 97 x 66 x 17mm

Mass: 270g

To make this device available for the open source developer community, there is an idea for a group purchase (Features EM-X270-C520-W-H-K + LCD35+KEYPAD+BAT10) organized by the [[http://www.handheld-linux.com Handheld Linux Shop]] which would come to approx. 649 EUR (incl. VAT) / 750 US$ (excl. Tax) if 100 units are reached (20% less if 500 units). Contact: mailto:sales@handheld-linux.com

See the [[Talk:Compulab_EM-X270|Talk]] page for more info and possible buying alternatives

== Case==
The PDA module has no case. So we should find someone who can design and manufacture a robust polymer/metal case. Alternatively, we could produce files allowing users to make their own. Schematics for the dimensions of the Compulab circuitry are provided [http://compulab.co.il/x270em/html/x270-em-developer.py here] along with various other development friendly files.
