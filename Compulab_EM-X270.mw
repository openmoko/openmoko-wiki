The EM-X270 is an embedded computer board, produced by [http://www.compulab.co.il/x270em/html/x270-em-datasheet.htm  Compulab], an Israel-based company specialising in Single Board Computers (SBC). The manufacturers provide Angstrom (a variant of Debian Linux upon which Openmoko is based) as the operating system, with full support for all listed peripherals (Wi-Fi support coming in December 2007).<br>
The board has a range of optional components which can be specified for full mobile phone capabilities, and more (to a level similar to that of the [[Neo1973]]), as detailed below:

=Dimensions (including battery and screen)=
Size: 97 x 66 x 17mm

Mass: 270g

==Modules==
Compulab has a strict sales policy: only to companies, only in large quantities, only if one evaluation board is bought

To make this device available for the open source developer community, there is an idea for a group purchase (Features EM-X270-C520-W-H-K + LCD35+KEYPAD+BAT10) organized by the [[http://www.handheld-linux.com Handheld Linux Shop]] which would come to approx. 649 EUR (incl. VAT) / 750 US$ (excl. Tax) if 100 units are reached (20% less if 500 units). Contact: mailto:sales@handheld-linux.com

[[http://www.handheld-linux.com Handheld Linux Shop]]  has now officially started the Group Buy. Please refer to [[http://www.handheld-linux.com/wiki.php?page=CompuLab%20PDA%20Module]] for details.

See the [[Talk:Compulab_EM-X270|Talk]] page for more info and possible buying alternatives

== Case==
The PDA module has no case. So we should find someone who can design and manufacture a robust polymer/metal case. Alternatively, we could produce files allowing users to make their own. Schematics for the dimensions of the Compulab circuitry are provided [http://compulab.co.il/x270em/html/x270-em-developer.py here] along with various other development friendly files.

There has been a quite similar discussion for alternate cases for the Neo 1973: [[Hardware:Neo1973:Alternate Cases]]
