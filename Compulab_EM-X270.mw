CompuLabs has a quite strict sales policy: only to companies, only in large quantities, only if one evaluation board is bought

To make this device available for the open source developer community, there is an idea for a group purchase organized by the [[http://www.handheld-linux.com Handheld Linux Shop]] which would come to approx. 649 EUR (incl. VAT) / 750 US$ (excl. Tax) if 100 units are reached (20% less if 500 units). Contact: mailto:sales@handheld-linux.com
