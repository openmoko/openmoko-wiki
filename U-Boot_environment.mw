{{Bootloader}}

The bootloader environment configures the [[bootloader]]. Between reboots, the environment is stored with a checksum in the internal flash [[Partitions|partition]] called "u-boot_env". On the bootloader console, there are [[bootloader commands#Environment|bootloader commands for environment manipulation]].

== Typical environment ==

<pre>
baudrate=115200
bootargs=rootfstype=jffs2 root=/dev/mtdblock4 console=ttySAC0,115200 console=tty0 loglevel=8 dyntick=enable lpj=252416
usbtty=cdc_acm
bootdelay=10
stdout=serial
stderr=serial
stdin=serial
mtdparts=mtdparts=neo1973-nand:0x00030000(u-boot),0x0000c000(u-boot_env),0x00200000(kernel),0x00130000(splash),0x03c94000(rootfs)
mtdids=nand0=neo1973-nand
bootargs_base=rootfstype=jffs2 root=/dev/mtdblock4 console=ttySAC0,115200 console=tty0 loglevel=8 dyntick=enable lpj=252416
bootcmd=setenv bootargs ${bootargs_base} ${mtdparts}; nand read.e 0x32000000 kernel; bootm 0x32000000
pcf50606_int1=0x40
filesize=160C000
partition=nand0,0
mtddevnum=0
mtddevname=u-boot
</pre>

== Timeouts ==

If the boot loader menu is on the screen, the phone will power off when there hasn't been activity for a while. This is not nice if you are working on the boot loader console, but you can make the time longer:
<pre>
setenv boot_menu_timeout [seconds]
</pre>

After the phone is powered on, there is a short period of time when you can connect to the console and cancel the automatic boot without going to the menu:
<pre>
setenv bootdelay [seconds]
</pre>

== Menu ==

You can add items to the boot menu by setting environment variables of the form ''menu_<number>'' to values of the form ''<Title>: U-Boot-Commands''.

For example the following command will add a boot menu entry that switches to autofast charging and turns off the backlight:
setenv menu_6 Autofast-Charge and Backlight Off: neo1973 charger autofast\; neo1973 backlight off

While in this state, your Neo1973 can be charged with a generic USB charger. You also need to set boot_menu_timeout to 65000 to keep it from powering down, though.

=== Booting to the menu ===
To stop in the NAND menu, press and hold the AUX key after pressing the power button at startup. In recent versions of u-boot (builds from august 5 200?), you can also permanently enter the menu by setting the <tt>stop_in_menu</tt> environment variable to <tt>yes</tt>:

setenv stop_in_menu yes
saveenv

to restore normal startup, unset this variable or set it to <tt>no</tt>.

== Console ==

To get access to the bootloader console over USB with e.g., [[NeoCon]], the following settings need to be made:
<pre>
GTA01Bv2 # setenv stderr usbtty
GTA01Bv2 # setenv stdout usbtty
GTA01Bv2 # setenv stdin usbtty
</pre>
