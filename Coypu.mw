==Introduction==
Coypu is a utility for send file via Bluetooth. For now work only from openmoko to other device.
You have to install obexpush from angstrom repository [http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/feeds/2008/ipk/glibc/armv4t/base/obexpush_1.0.0-r3.1_armv4t.ipk]
For now this software has a lot of problems.

There are several obex programs allowing file transfer, all in console at the moment. Obexpush installs obextool, and opd daemon:

 opkg install obexpush

Default receiving path (editable in /etc/default/opd_args ) doesn exist, so create it

 mkdir /var/obexpush

Files are then received automatically, no notice, no confirmation... they just silently appear in /var/obexpush

To send some files, first scan for devices:

 hcitool scan
 Scanning ...
 	00:16:41:F5:A5:BC	laptop

Then send it onto bt address found in the scan:

 obextool push image.jpg 00:16:41:F5:A5:BC 10

The console tools are for testing the interface (see [[SHR User Manual]]).

==Installation==
You can download opk fils from following link

 http://minucci.net/file/opkg/coypu_0.1_all.opk

and then:

 opkg install coypu_0.1_all.opk

or directly:

 opkg install http://minucci.net/file/opkg/coypu_0.1_all.opk

Or you can use repository http://minucci.net/file/opkg/ . For add repository follow this command:

 cd /etc/opkg
 wget http://minucci.net/file/gecco-feed.conf
