Most handheld platforms have some sort of bible, or religeous text reader. An excellent example would be bible+ for the palm platform. A good generic approach so that the reader was designed to read any religeous text would be a good idea.

:''This is probably redundant if a good generic ebook [[reader]] can be be found/developed. What are compelling advantages of a "bible reader" over an "ebook reader"?

::Most religeous texts are broken into separate books. Another issue is that individuals may want to see dual language versions with a religeous text (IE, for the new testament, greek/english). Beyond the segmentation into books, each verse of a religeous text is usually noted. If I were reading a traditional book, I wouldn't care what verse I was reading, but with a religeous text, the verse/line pairing is important. I am fairly sure that these approaches are true of all abrahamic religeons, however, I would suspect that they are also true of other religeons as well.

I've registered at the sword-devel list and got links to two python sword projects [http://hurdygurdy.dyndns.org/maemosword/], [http://hurdygurdy.dyndns.org/maemosword/]. First Step to get a good biblereader for openmoko is to think about the interface, because the rest is already ready in other projects I think, the only difference is the interface. A very important point for me is, it should be usable without pen! --[[User:White gecko|White gecko]] 01:53, 6 September 2008 (UTC)
:QPSword looks good, but we need a fingerinterface. --[[User:White gecko|White gecko]] 15:41, 6 September 2008 (UTC)


== GoBible ==
Work has started to port the [http://code.google.com/p/gobible/ GoBible Reader] to the Openmoko, code is in the GoBible repository. It is based on Java (jamvm, classpath and swt). A couple of screenshots:

== Linux desktop bible readers ==
A very nice enviroment is the sword project: [http://www.crosswire.org/sword/]

Here are the applications runing on Linux (desktop):

* [http://www.crosswire.org/jsword/ JSword] - Java
* [http://gnomesword.sourceforge.net/ GnomeSword] - GTK+/GNOME
* [http://www.bibletime.info/ BibleTime] - Qt/KDE 
* [http://www.crosswire.org/bibledesktop/ BibleDesktop] - Java, based on JSword
* [http://code.google.com/p/bpbible/ bpbible] - wxPython, based on Sword
* [http://hurdygurdy.dyndns.org/maemosword/ Rapier] - pygtk, biblereader for maemo, based on Sword
* [http://www.crosswire.org/qpsword/ QPSword] - qtopia, biblereader for qtopia, i think this is our favorite


maybe one of this can be ported to Openmoko.
:I think we need a special interface for openmoko, with no menus and view buttons on one screen-view --[[User:White gecko|White gecko]] 01:58, 6 September 2008 (UTC)
