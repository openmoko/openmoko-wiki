Most handheld platforms have some sort of bible, or religeous text reader. An excellent example would be bible+ for the palm platform. A good generic approach so that the reader was designed to read any religeous text would be a good idea.

This is probably redundant if a good generic ebook reader can be be found/developed. What are compelling advantages of a "bible reader" over an "ebook reader"?

A "Bible Reader" may have better handling of regular reading practices, for instance someone who wishes to do a daily devotion, or similar. bible+ does not seem to have this function, however, so perhaps a more fully-featured program such as Gnomesword would be a better inspiration.
