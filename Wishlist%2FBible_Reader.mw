Most handheld platforms have some sort of bible, or religeous text reader. An excellent example would be bible+ for the palm platform. A good generic approach so that the reader was designed to read any religeous text would be a good idea.

This is probably redundant if a good generic ebook reader can be be found/developed. What are compelling advantages of a "bible reader" over an "ebook reader"?

Most religeous texts are broken into separate books. Another issue is that individuals may want to see dual language versions with a religeous text (IE, for the new testament, greek/english). Beyond the segmentation into books, each verse of a religeous text is usually noted. If I were reading a traditional book, I wouldn't care what verse I was reading, but with a religeous text, the verse/line pairing is important. I am fairly sure that these approaches are true of all abrahamic religeons, however, I would suspect that they are also true of other religeons as well.


A "Bible Reader" may have better handling of regular reading practices, for instance someone who wishes to do a daily devotion, or similar. bible+ does not seem to have this function, however, so perhaps a more fully-featured program such as Gnomesword would be a better inspiration.
Perhaps this should be in "talk", also.
