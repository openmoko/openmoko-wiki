Most handheld platforms have some sort of bible, or religeous text reader. An excellent example would be bible+ for the palm platform. A good generic approach so that the reader was designed to read any religeous text would be a good idea.

This is probably redundant if a good generic ebook reader can be be found/developed. What are compelling advantages of a "bible reader" over an "ebook reader"?
