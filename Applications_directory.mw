The purpose of this page is not to be exhaustive, but simply to provide an easy shelter where everybody can add links for Openmoko-related programs. Applications, scripts, projects, distributions, images at all maturity levels are welcome, especially if they are not on http://projects.openmoko.org. Please limit each entry to one line. You may create a new wiki page or just provide an outgoing link.
