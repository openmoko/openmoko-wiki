From [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UMTS Wikipedia UMTS]: '''Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS)''' is a mobile standard of the ''third-generation (3G)'''.

The [[Neo 1973]] does not support UMTS.
The [[Neo FreeRunner]] will not support UMTS.

In [[Neo1973_compatible_cellphone_providers#Japan|Japan, only UMTS]] is available, no GSM network exists there. For this and other reasons, support for UMTS is very desirable. This can be accommodated in the device itself or externally with '''supported''' peripheral hardware via [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UMTS#3G_Handsets_and_Modems UMTS tether mode] using USB, Bluetooh, WiFi or infrared. The 2nd generation of Apple's iPhone (iPhone 3G) supports now UMTS, too.

== Ideas for a workaround for the Freerunner ==

If you have installed a distribution like debian you could get UMTS running with a simple USB-Modem and a low-cost usb gender changer. The stick should be recognised as a mass storage but with [http://umtsmon.sourceforge.net UMTSmon] crosscompiled you should be able to use it as a modem. A list of supported devices is found [http://umtsmon.sourceforge.net/cards/ here]. 

If you have still problems using the card as a modem have a look at the [http://packages.debian.org/sid/usb-modeswitch USB-Modeswitch] within the sid/unstable tree.

If your Neo then detects the stick as a modem you could use [http://packages.debian.org/sid/wvdial WvDial] or similiar tools to establish a connection.

Some instructions could be given by [http://translate.google.de/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ccc-mannheim.de%2Fwiki%2FLinux_UMTS&sl=de&tl=en&hl=de&ie=UTF-8 this] page.
