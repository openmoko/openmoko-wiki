{{Hardware Wishlist}}

Use cases that can be satisfied with a VGA fixed-focus or macro camera.
* I want to take pictures of items in shops, along with their price labels. This allows easy comparison shopping without writing down all of the details.
* I want to take pictures of any accidents I may be involved in, to ease insurance claims. (accelerometer or GPS logs may be of use too)
* Reading barcodes, or 2D barcodes. For example to enable automatic ordering as you use barcoded products.
* Scanning Barcodes.
* Scanning 2D barcodes.
* Noting positions of hardware when dissasembling.
* Seeing over tall fences.
* Seeing into confined access spaces - in some cases an LED flash would be required.
* Adding thumbnail pictures to contact lists.
* Taking pictures with the GPS position logged, with [[Openstreetmap]] to help with mapping or Upload to Google earth.
* Gesture interfaces.
* Capturing business card images for OCR.
* General OCR (higher res is better).
* Taking pictures of drunk people, a system that allows near-instantaneous grab phone, take picture interaction

Use cases that require more.

* Printable photos.
* Optical Zoom to distant objects.
* Low light photography.
* Astrophotography.
* Quality web-page photos.
* HDR Photography



* Principal 5MPixels camera and secondary camera for video-conference.


=== Camera interface ===

The [[Neo1973_Hardware#Processor|current Neo1973 processor]] does not have a camera interface. A chip with the [http://www.mipi.org/ MIPI] Camera Serial Interface (CSI-2) might be used as a future proof solution. The standard is available to companies who have joined the alliance.

A chip that complies to the open [http://www.smia-forum.org/ Standard Mobile Imaging Architecture (SMIA)] Compact Camera Port (CCP2) serial interface may be (more) desirable. The [http://www.framos.de/www.dir/en/hersteller/micron/sensors/image/prod.dir/2286/index_en.html Micron MT9D012] is a 2 Megapixel chip and one of many that complies to these standards.

There are [http://www.micron.com/products/cmos/ 3.1, 5 and 8 Mega Pixel chips] available as well but I don't know if they comply to the above standards. Either way a 2 Mega pixel chip would be basic by the time it was ever implemented into a newer model.

===Liquid Lens camera===
* A [http://www.varioptic.com/en/products/products01.php Liquid Lens] camera for small, low power, electronically controlled autofocus. <br />Also available as part of an SMIA compatible camera module!


===Telescope===
* A removable [http://mobile.brando.com.hk/MobilePhoneTelescope-Nokia.php telescope] or telephoto lens.

===Tripod===

A tripod socket would make a camera more usable.

===Interface to external camera===
Even if Gen1 Neos have no camera, it would be nice to get interfaces with external cameras to allow applications like GPS tagging of photos, barcode reading, and OCR to be up and running.  Are there plans to write software to interface with cameras directly via USB?  Bluetooth?  WiFi?
