Where is my FreeRunner?  In order to give you an idea of when your FreeRunner will be shipped, this is a list of order numbers against shipping confirmation email dates.  These numbers have been taken from the community mailing list and the #openmoko IRC channel.   

Note that there may be gaps in the order numbers, and the assumption here is that lower order numbers ship first.  Also note that the tracking email has a subject similar to "UPS Ship Notification, Tracking Number ..." and is from "auto-notify@ups.com" or "pkginfo@ups.com" so you may miss it if you're searching for "moko" as a keyword.

Here are example mail headers:

 From pkginfo@ups.com  Fri Jul 11 21:10:55 2008
 Return-Path: pkginfo@ups.com
 From: UPS Quantum View <auto-notify@ups.com>
 Reply-To: auto-notify@ups.com
 Subject: UPS Ship Notification, Tracking Number 1Z0000000000000000
