Where is my FreeRunner?  In order to give you an idea of when your FreeRunner will be shipped, this is a list of order numbers against shipping confirmation email dates.  These numbers have been taken from the community mailing list and the #openmoko IRC channel.   

Note that there may be gaps in the order numbers, and the assumption here is that lower order numbers ship first.
