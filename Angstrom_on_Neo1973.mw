This page describes the process on getting the [http://www.angstrom-distribution.org Ångström distribution] running on Neo1973-GTA01. These instructions will evolve as better support is added - for now this is just a quick list on the required steps.

{{note|These instructions will not result in a proper installation supporting the device. There will be no power management, no GSM, no GPS, etc. This is just for hacking and fun.}}


== Flashing ==

* Download kernel: http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/unstable/images/fic-gta01/20070709/uImage-2.6.21.3-moko10-r3-fic-gta01.bin (link dead)
* Download root-image: http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/unstable/images/fic-gta01/20070709/Angstrom-console-image-glibc-test-20070709-fic-gta01.rootfs.jffs2 (link dead)
* Flash these via dfu-util as explained on [[Flashing the Neo 1973]].

== Connecting to the internet ==

* Boot up the phone - the kernel should boot, and after that graphical boot will continue. Wait until graphical boot is complete.
* Connect the phone to your computer with the USB cable
* Set up a connection to the internet for your phone, details in [[USB Networking]]
* <tt>ssh root@192.168.0.202</tt>
* Add some working nameservers to <tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt>

== Adding packages ==

* Run <tt>ipkg update</tt> - New package lists should be downloaded
* Run <tt>ipkg install xserver-kdrive-fbdev</tt> - This should install the X server
* Add packages to taste, for example <tt>ipkg install task-base-extended angstrom-x11-base-depends angstrom-gpe-task-base angstrom-gpe-task-settings libesd0</tt>
* Reboot the phone

== Done ==

After rebooting X should start at the end of the graphical boot and the first application to start up should be stylus calibration and then creating the first user account.
