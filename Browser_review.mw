== Ewww ==
'''Introduction''' Actually just a test/demo app that has been lately renamed to Eve.<BR>
'''Tested version / Latest version''' 	<BR>
'''Engine''' 	<BR>
'''Installation'''<br>
 ''2008.12+Kustomizer:''
 cd /
 wget http://downloads.tuxfamily.org/3v1deb/openmoko/e17-illume%2bsvn20090109.tar.bz2
 wget http://downloads.tuxfamily.org/3v1deb/openmoko/ewww-libeWebKit%2bgit20090109.tar.bz2
 tar jxf the files above
 DISPLAY=:0 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/e17/lib /usr/e17/bin/ewww
'''Start View''' Google.com. previous/next/refresh buttons, address bar and configuration button. 	<BR>
'''Typing in an URL''' Select the old address in the address bar & type the address. Works nice!<BR>
'''Back / Forward, Stop, Home, Refresh''' Back/Forward and Refresh work nice<BR>
'''Popups''' No popups with popuptester.<BR>
'''Tabs''' Don't know. Might support but there's no way to open new tabs.<BR>
'''Frames''' Works nice!<BR>
'''Bookmarks'''	Has a button for it but doesn't work.<BR>
'''HTML Forms''' Works nice! <BR>
'''Gmail''' won't load gmail.google.com<BR>
'''Google calendar''' won't load calendar.google.comoho<BR>
'''Cookies''' Works nice! <BR>
'''SSL''' Won't load the page<BR>
'''Password''' Doesn't remember<BR>
'''Javascript''' Works, test result 6554 ms<BR>
'''CSS''' Yes except the popup telling the time<BR>
'''ACID''' ACID3: 99/100<BR>
'''Notes''' Rendering works very nice & smooth. Scrolling the pages is easy. Too bad the gmail and secured pages and bookmarks are not implemented. If you need to quickly check the bus timetables, this works nice for it (especially if you've created your own link page in the internet). Remember that this is just a test browser and already replaced by Eve (not avaible for tests?)<BR>

== Dillo ==

tested on SHR-testing (2009-03-03)

'''Introduction''' Very fast lightweight browser. start-up time less than 1 second (fastest Freerunner application). Configured by editing ~/.dillo/dillorc. Not well suited to finger navigation.<BR>
'''Tested version / Latest version''' 	dillo-ssl_2.0-r0_armv4t.opk/2.0 (changelog mentions 2.1, but only 2.0 is available for download)<BR>
'''Engine''' 	FLTK2<BR>
'''Installation''' 	<BR>
 ''SHR-testing:''
 cd /usr/lib
 ln -s libssl.so.0.9.8 libssl.so.0.9.7
 ln -s libcrypto.so.0.9.8 libcrypto.so.0.9.7
 ldconfig
 wget http://misc.andi.de1.cc/dillo/dillo-ssl_2.0-r0_armv4t.opk
 opkg -nodeps install dillo-ssl_2.0-r0_armv4t.opk
'''Start View''' 	Its own local index page with help.<BR>
'''Typing in an URL''' 	Easy, directly at the address line.<BR>
'''Back / Forward, Stop, Home''' 	Work all right.<BR>
'''Popups''' 	No popup window appears.<BR>
'''Tabs''' 	Tabs work quite well, however, new tab can be opened from the File menu only. loading in the background can be set in dillorc with focus_new_tab.<BR>
'''Frames''' 	Frames do not work - dillo offers you to choose which frame to display.<BR>
'''Bookmarks'''	Bookmarks are handled by its own local dynamic web form which allows to add/delete bookmarks and organize them in sections.<BR>
'''HTML Forms''' 	Forms work ok.<BR>
'''Gmail''' 	Cannot log in :-(  Dillo just displays annoying warning about meta refresh tag and clicking it does not go anywhere.<BR>
'''Google calendar''' 	No - the same problem as with Gmail.<BR>
'''Cookies''' 	Cookie test successful.<BR>
'''SSL''' 	Annoying message "The remote certificate cannot be verified (code 20)" for each https page load. But after "Continue" works ok (but not the page from Template - it does nothing, don't know why).<BR>
'''Password''' 	No.<BR>
'''Javascript''' 	No Javascript. <BR>
'''CSS''' 	Some "alpha" CSS support is in. This feature seems to be in development right now (March 2009).<BR>
'''ACID''' 	 Do not pass (or just partly - requires Javascript?). <BR>
'''IPv6''' 	No.<BR>
'''Notes''' 	Good for pages with mostly text and some pictures - works very fast.<BR>
'''More information''' 	http://www.dillo.org/<BR>
