'''Om 2008''' was the third major revision of the Om distribution released by Openmoko. It was the sucessor to [[Om 2007.2]] and had '''ASU''' as a codename.

Om 2008 uses EFL for the launcher, custom UI applications and [[Qtopia on X11]] for telephony. The distribution  was the first step from GTK+ on X11 , which was used on [[Om 2007.1]] and [[Om 2007.2]] to using multiple toolkits in combination.

Compared to 2007.2 that had a longer development history, Om 2008 was definitely a .0 major release. So think KDE 4.0 vs. 3.5, not Linux 2.6.23 vs. 2.6.22. There were daily updates, some good some bad.

The initial version named ''[[Om 2008.8]]'' was [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-August/025619.html released] on '''August 08, 2008'''. Updated images  labelled ''[[Om 2008.9]]'' and ''[[Om 2008.12]]'' were released later that year. 

== What was new compared to 2007.2 ? ==

The main user-visible changes introduced in 2008 were:

* The user interface was fully revised with a new window manager [[illume]]. It is visually richer, and can be customized further by using [[Edje]] files.
* '''[[Om2008.8_Installer|A graphical installer]]''' allows to easily add new applications, [[Themes]] and functionality.
* A new [[Om2008.8_Locations|Locations]] application is provided, to save your favorite spots and share them with friends via sms.
* Power management has been improved: The Aux button now locks the screen, the Power button suspends and the red LED behind the Aux button lights up when charging.
* The [[Om2008.8_Keyboard| keyboard]] was changed to the Qtopia one (whether this is an improvement has been [[Keyboard_Debate|hotly debated]]).

For developers, the main changes were:
* Multiple toolkits: '''Om 2008.8''' supports [http://www.enlightenment.org/ EFL], [http://trolltech.com/products/qtopia Qtopia] and [http://www.gtk.org GTK+] applications.
* A [[Community Repository]] has been set up, it is integrated in the ([[Om2008.8_Installer|Installer]]).
* '''Source Codes''' are publicly available, allowing for customization all the way down to low level systems.
