... is a playground for me. I wanted to test some things: without reinventing the wheel again and again, using existing resources like windowmanager (openbox) and desktop-iconsoftware (idesk). ~

My hope was to fasten and simplify handling.

I used shr unstable with all updates until 2009-10-15 and made some changes on it.

* windowmanager: openbox and obconf (patched few lines of code)
* desktop-software(icons): idesk
* keyboard: literki
* screenlock: xtrlock (modified)
* desktop-status: xminimokostatus (new written)

* Update-Package from 1. Version to actual [http://openmoko.huber-computer.de/minimoko_update.tbz]http://openmoko.huber-computer.de/minimoko_update.tbz (~1 MB)

= Install =
untar it onto an ext3-sdcard. nothing more is to do.
boot with qi.

= Usage =
It bases on shr, so the base is shr-like. If you want to get illume, just rename .Xsession to .Xsession.unused

== Tips ==
* When you use obconf, the configuration is "copied" into .config/openbox/rc.xml and furthermore used from there
* Minimized Windows are excluded from the slide function, you have to bring them up with menu -> windows
* To bring the keyboard up, slide from bottom right up and slide down to bring it down

== Knobs, touches ... ==
* single click on an icon starts the program which lays behind .idesktop/<application>.lnk
* AUX locks the screen with xtrlock. Pressing one more AUX unlocks the screen
* POWER short pressed suspends
* POWER for more or equal 2 Seconds shuts the system down with init 0
* Slide(drag to the right, for example) on the top bar of an application switches to the next application
* Double Click on the topbar of an application shows the Main Menu 
* Double Click on the empty desktop shows the Main Menu
* On the left of the topbar is the knob for minimizing the app, on the right topbar is the close knob

== Menus ==
if you installed new applications and want the menu updated, use:
  /usr/bin/makemenus
after that, you can remove unused menuitems in /etc/xdg/openbox/openmoko.menu

= Sources / Patches / Binaries =
* openbox needed to have a little patch because of the behavior of the om-applications: client.patch [http://openmoko.huber-computer.de/client.patch client.patch] and prompt.patch [http://openmoko.huber-computer.de/prompt.patch prompt.patch]
