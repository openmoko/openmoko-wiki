... is a playground for me. I wanted to test some things: without reinventing the wheel again and again, using existing resources like windowmanager (openbox) and desktop-iconsoftware (idesk). ~

My hope was to fasten and simplify handling.

I used shr unstable with all updates until 2009-10-15 and made some changes on it.

* windowmanager: openbox (patched few lines of code)
* desktop-software(icons): idesk
* keyboard: literki
* screenlock: zedlock (modified)

= Download =
[http://openmoko.huber-computer.de/minimoko.tbz]http://openmoko.huber-computer.de/minimoko.tbz (full image, ~80 MB)

= Install =
untar it onto an ext3-sdcard. nothing more is to do.
boot with qi.

= Usage =
It bases on shr, so the base is shr-like. If you want to get illume, just rename .Xsession to .Xsession.unused

== Knobs, touches ... ==
* single click on an icon starts the program which lays behind .idesktop/<application>.lnk
* AUX locks the screen with zedlock. Pressing one more AUX unlocks the screen, but also a large Z, painted  on the screen
* POWER short pressed suspends
* POWER for more or equal 2 Seconds shuts the system down with init 0
* Slide(drag to the right, for example) on the top bar of an application switches to the next application
* Double Click on the topbar of an application shows the Main Menu 
* Double Click on the empty desktop shows the Main Menu
* On the left of the topbar is the knob for minimizing the app, on the right topbar is the close knob

== Menus ==
if you installed new applications and want the menu updated, use:
  /usr/bin/makemenus

= Sources / Patches =
* openbox needed to have a little patch because of the behavior of the om-applications: client.patch [http://openmoko.huber-computer.de/client.patch] and prompt.patch [http://openmoko.huber-computer.de/prompt.patch]
* i wrote a little helper, which places text on the root window: [http://openmoko.huber-computer.de/xroottext.tgz] Lic: GPL_Newest
