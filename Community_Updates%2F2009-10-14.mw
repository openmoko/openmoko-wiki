{{ApplicationBox|
Name=sgt-puzzles|
Description=This package is a port of Simon Tatham's [http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/ Portable Puzzle Collection], for SHR and similar distros for use on the Neo FreeRunner. This package includes a shell script that lets users disable/enable individual desktop icons, making it possible to reduce the number even without installing a launcher. It also includes some basic support for launchers, automatically removing the desktop icons when a compatible launcher is installed, except those icons that have been explicitly enabled (so you can have both a launcher, and your favorite games on the desktop for quick access). [http://ipk.edorfaus.info/armv4t/sgt-puzzles-launcher_10_armv4t.ipk Examle launcher] is also created, and packaged separately. It is fairly simple, just displays a grid of plain buttons, but space is so limited due to the number of games.|

Name=[[Advanced Geocaching Tool for Linux]] 0.4.0|
Description=AGTL makes geocaching paperless! It downloads cache locations in the area visible on the map including their description, hints, difficulty levels and images. Searching for caches in your local db is a matter of seconds. The currently selected cache is shown on the map (and also all the others if you want) and there's a traditional compass-like view that always points at the cache. A manual exists [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Advanced_Geocaching_Tool_for_Linux on the wiki]. 0.4.0 version contains lots of new features:
* Added cool command line interface! See below for features. 
* Completely new search feature
* New "marking" feature: Mark interesting geocaches and get back to them quickly.
* Added upper bound for visible caches to improve speed
* Added upscaling of missing map tiles
* Changed image loading*
* Don't redraw map on movement if your position isn't shown anyway
* Changed quality indicator to see how exact the shown position is. Shows if DPGS-Satellites (SBAS) are in sight.
* Recursive retrieval of geocaches. Download more geocaches with one click.
* bearing-hold function now works.
* better map drawing: see faster, which tiles are missing
* better hint decoding
* added python-json dependency
* Faster downloading of geocaches. 
* Removed exporting function until it is adapted to the new downloader 
* Smaller default size for use on netbooks|
