Name=sgt-puzzles|
Description=This package is a port of Simon Tatham's [http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/ Portable Puzzle Collection], for SHR and similar distros for use on the Neo FreeRunner. This package includes a shell script that lets users disable/enable individual desktop icons, making it possible to reduce the number even without installing a launcher. It also includes some basic support for launchers, automatically removing the desktop icons when a compatible launcher is installed, except those icons that have been explicitly enabled (so you can have both a launcher, and your favorite games on the desktop for quick access). [http://ipk.edorfaus.info/armv4t/sgt-puzzles-launcher_10_armv4t.ipk Examle launcher] is also created, and packaged separately. It is fairly simple, just displays a grid of plain buttons, but space is so limited due to the number of games.|

A manual exists [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Advanced_Geocaching_Tool_for_Linux on the wiki]. 0.4.0 version contains lots of new features:
* Added cool command line interface! See below for features.

* bearing-hold function now works.
* better map drawing: see faster, which tiles are missing
* better hint decoding
* added python-json dependency
* Faster downloading of geocaches.

==Community==
* Sadly for FreeRunner community, Rod Whitby decided to leave us and started a new community [http://www.webos-internals.org/wiki/Main_Page webos-internals] , which does open source Linux-based development for the [http://www.palm.com/us/products/phones/pre/ Palm Pre]. On his good bye [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.hardware.smartphones.userland/1768 email], he wished everyone continuing down the OpenMoko path the best of success in the future. One of his great jobs was developing [[Mokomakefile]].
* The European Union has opened its [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Geostationary_Navigation_Overlay_Service EGNOS] navigation augmentation system for public use. According to [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.handhelds.openmoko.community/50865 this thread], FreeRunner might be able to use EGNOS.
* David Samblas has [http://www.tuxbrain.com/en/content/om-showroom-something-show showed] some work he has done for now regarding OM-Showroom. It still needs more work, both on the server and in the code before it can go online, but there are some screenshots to show the work in progress. Comments and of course collaboration are welcome.
* Christoph Mair did a great job of adding a pressure sensor to FreeRuner! The BMP085 chip from Bosch Sensortec is a small (5x5x1.5mm) chip which includes a pressure and a temperature sensor. Power and I2C is enough to get it working. You can glue it easily next to the Bluetooth antenna. The [[I2C_Pressure_Sensor]] wiki page contains some pictures.
* Because of heavy load of traffic, Radek Polak decided to move QtMoko downloads to new location at [https://sourceforge.net/projects/qtmoko/files/ sourceforge.net]. There is also mirror of GIT tree, but use it only as backup, main development will remain on github. Other SF services, like mailing list, also can be used if needed.
* Sean Moss-Pultz announced birth of [http://thewikireader.com/ WikiReader].
* As usual you can track progress ofgta02-core project on Álvaro Lopes [http://gta02-core-news.blogspot.com/ blog]. Álvaro does his best to update it every week.

* [http://chitlesh.fedorapeople.org/FEL/ Fedora Electronic Lab] announced support for openmoko hardware development. Hence for Fedora-12 release, they have included the trunk version of kicad, openocd, and fped. Thus openmoko developers can now work out of the box with this software.
