== Sport tracker ==

The idea of this program is to help a user to track the distance/velocity they have traveled.

== Use Cases ==

* I am going running.  I start the tracker at the beginning of the run, and stop the tracker when I'm done.  The tracker tells me how far I've run, how long it took, calories burned, and average pace (as well as max and min pace?).

* I want to time myself on a run of a certain distance, but I don't feel like running at the track.  I pick a course where I can run an arbitrary distance, start the tracker (after specifying how far I want to run) and take off.  The tracker begins tracking distance and time.  The phone vibrates/rings to notify me that I have completed the run and it automatically stops the timer.

* I want to run at a certain pace.  I input my desired pace in the sport tracker and begin running.  The sport tracker informs me visually and/or audibly when I go over a certain (configurable?) threshold faster or slower than the desired pace.  It would help to learn what the desired tempo feels like.
