== Sport tracker ==

The idea of this program is to help a user to track the distance/velocity they have traveled.

== Use Cases ==

* I am going running.  I start the tracker at the beginning of the run, and stop the tracker when I'm done.  The tracker tells me how far I've run.

* I want to time myself on a run of a certain distance, but I don't feel like running at the track.  I pick a course where I can run an arbitrary distance, start the tracker (after specifying how far I want to run) and take off.  The tracker begins tracking distance and time.  The phone vibrates/rings to notify me that I have completed the run and it also stops the timer.

* I want to run at a certain pace.  I input my desired pace in the sport tracker and begin running.  The sport tracker informs me visually and/or audibly when I go over a certain (configurable?) threshold faster or slower than the desired pace.  It would help to learn what the desired tempo feels like.
