{{OM2007.2}}
I've been literally playing with my Moko lately, and figured I'd put fingers to keyboard with a little overview. Some of this is just stubs, and some are more informative. The first round of this is a recent (Jan?) build of OM.

===Black Box===
Played on a checkerboard type grid. The central board is where the discs(?) are hiding. There is some information displayed surrounding the board, in a flap like extension of the board. More research needed.

===Bridges===
A classic bridge building game, I think. A bunch of circles (islands?) populate the playing area, with the inside of each circle denoting how many connections that circle supports. You can't cross connections, and only two connections are permitted directly between each pair of circles. Connect pairs by dragging a connection between them. Drag a third time to reset connections to zero.
Seems to "get mad" sometimes, and turns a circle red and stops allowing any drawing, and means you have to restart that map. Overall fun and easy to play.

===Cube===
Giant cube rolls around, picking up blue paint and depositing it on different squares. The objective is to completely paint cube.

===Dominosa===
Grid of numbers, which you are allowed to pick in pairs. Goal is apparently to use all of the pairs up with none left over. More research needed.

===Fifteen===
One of those little moving tile puzzles from when you were a kid. Features 15 tiles which interlock, with one free space so that you can slide the tiles around. Goal is to arrange the numbers from lowest to highest, starting with the top left and then going left to right and then down each row. Lots of fun.

===Flip===
Grid with a picture, which shows how the "flipping" works. Tiles are two sided, with a grey and a white side, and clicking "flips" the tile. The goal is to have all the tiles with their white side up.

===Guess===
Akin to Mastermind. You are trying to figure out the 4 choices, in the correct order, from a possible choice of 6 different colored pegs. The pegs may be repeated. Each "guess" results in clues -- black pegs mean correct color and position, white pegs denote proper color in the wrong position. You drag a color to the position you want to try -- either from a color palette on the side, or from another guessed peg. Click on the 4 small side pegs to see the results of your guess. 10 guesses to get it right. Very good, quite playable.

===Inertia===
Played in a crossword like grid, there are diamonds, mines and dotted circles scattered around the board. Mines kill you, diamonds are the treasure you seek. The dotted circles capture you, as the name of the game implies, from  your inertia, as do walls. The surface is akin to ice, in that if you start to move, you'll continue to do so until you stop. Trickier then it seems at first glance, it's good for a few minutes of fun.

===Lightup===
Based on eight-queens chess puzzle. You need to place the bulbs so there is light on entire board. In addition there are black squares that stops light and black squares with numbers, this number says how many bulbs must be placed around that square.

===Loopy===

===Map===
The classic computer science problem - given a map with n areas and 4 colors, paint the areas in such a way such that no two adjoining areas have the same color. Simply drag colors from the pre-existing areas to color new areas. If you color an area wrong, just drag the new replacement on top. Easy to play, and can be entertaining.

===Mines===
Ever heard of Minesweeper? Same game, different name. I haven't figured out how to mark mines, but other then that, this is a great timewaster.

===[[User's Manual/Games/Net|Net]]===
Arrange the grid of pipes so that every blue box is connected to the black box in the center. Rotate any element by taping on it.

===Netslide===
A variation of Net, this time the tiles around the source slide around, and walls prevent direct connections between some adjacent tiles. More involved then Net, but very playable and still fun.

===Pattern===
Also known as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram Nonogram], the goal of the game is to reconstruct the pattern on the grid from the description. Every number stands for a continuous line in the respective row or column.

While remaining playable the game gets a lot harder without a right mouse button because one can't mark empty cells.

===Pegs===
I played this game as Hi-Q (or some similar name. In the rough shape of a plus sign, you are supposed to use one peg to jump another peg. While this is easy to understand, you are supposed to have as few pegs remaining when you are done as possible. Simply drag to jump pegs. Playable, and still fun, after all these years.

===Rect===
Rect is a rectangle game, where you are trying to enclose a certain square (with a number on it) with that number of total squares. I haven't figured out all of the restrictions, but it's a good and simple game.

===Same Game===
3 different color tiles are combined. Goal is to eliminate all of the tiles, but you can only eliminate tiles where there are 2 or more of the same color adjacent to each other.  As you eliminate some tiles, remaining ones "collapse" together.

===Sixteen===
Variation of Fifteen, but the tiles all slide horizontal or vertically in a row.

===Slant===
More research needed.

===Solo===
Sudoku game. No Idea how to get the numbers in.

===Tents===
Grid, where you have to layout tents. Numbers along the side tell you how many tents go in each row/column, and there are trees where you can't place tents. Simple, yet can be fun.

===Twiddle===
More research needed.

===Untangle===
Lines are all tangled up between various points. Your job is to untangle the web, ensuring that no lines cross between the points. Mostly entertaining, but picking the point with your finger can be a little fiddly.
