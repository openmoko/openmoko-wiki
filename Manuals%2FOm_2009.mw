'''Om 2009''' is the third version of the Linux distribution developed by Openmoko. 

==Installation==


=== Preparation ===
==== GSM firmware ====

If you don't have Moko11 as your GSM firmware yet, you should update it: See [[GSM/Flashing]]

==== bind-home ====

You can add a bind-home directory to the first partition (must be ext2 or ext3 ) of your SD card. On the Om 2009 boot it will be mounted as /home/root. This way you can reflash your phone without losing anything in your home directory ([[Paroli]] contacts and settings, maps, etc)

Make sure there isn't a bind-home directory first 
 ls /media/card/bind-home
If this exists you are already using bind-home, otherwise keep following the directions below and reboot after this
 mv /home/root /media/card/bind-home
 mkdir /home/root

==== Boot loader ====

Also update to the latest versions of [[qi]] or [[Bootloader|uboot]] bootloaders
The latest boot loader files are available at http://downloads.openmoko.org/distro/testing/

=== Om 2009 Installation on Flash ===

Installing Om 2009 is simple as flashing an image. Well, that's what you need to do..

# Download! You need the correct fso-paroli-image and uImage.bin files for your device. There are also rootfs tarballs for installing onto an SD card. [http://downloads.openmoko.org/distro/testing/NeoFreerunner Freerunner] or [http://downloads.openmoko.org/distro/testing/Neo1973 Neo1973]
# Flash! Detailed instructions for [[Flashing_the_Neo_Freerunner|Freerunner]] and [[Flashing_the_Neo_1973|Neo1973]].
# Start! The image will boot into fullscreen Paroli and all of the features listed above will be available. To learn more about Paroli, see [[Paroli]]

Boot AND REBOOT! The first time it boots there some problems might occur but they're gone after the second boot.

=== Installation on uSD ===
Make sure you use ext2 or ext3 as your file system on uSD. Then check this here: [[Paroli-developer-setup#Upgrading_Paroli_on_a_uSD_card_installation_of_OM2009]] or [[Booting_from_SD#Prepare_the_SD_card]].
