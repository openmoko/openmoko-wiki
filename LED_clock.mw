When an OpenMoko is sitting unused at night, turn it into an alarm clock with large red 7-segment digits on a black background in landscape mode.

This differs from the regular clock in that it's intended to be readable from a distance or with unfocused eyes, similar to commercial LED alarm clocks.

Since it's not limited to a single-colour display, it can do a few neat things like changing 'LED' colour to signify the hour before an alarm, or hue changing through night, or gradually brightening the whole display in the time preceding an alarm to simulate a dawn and provide gradual wake-up.

This provides an alternative to having the OM sitting in normal desktop mode while in a bedroom at night (which is too much unwanted illumination for no purpose), and an alternative to putting it into sleep mode (make it do something useful, make it easier to find)

== Installing ==

Download python file from:

http://projects.openmoko.org/projects/ledclock/

There is no .desktop file for it yet (could someone create one, and an installer or opkg or something?)
