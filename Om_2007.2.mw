'''OM 2007.2''' is the second version of the Openmoko distribution.  Development began on 2007-07-26.

Goals of the new version are an improved set of PIM applications, improved theming that fixes a lot of the usability problems of the 1st generation design, more formalized UI guidelines and a number of changes in the build system. The latter should introduce more recent software by staying closer in sync with upstream org.openembedded.dev.

An official announcement was made by Sean Moss-Pultz on August 20:
* http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/announce/2007-August/000018.html

(Initially this was named OM-2008 in SVN but renamed shortly after that.)

==FAQ==

=== Q: What are differences between 2007.1 and 2007.2? ===

* UI redesigned for small and recessed screen

=== Q: Where are official releases? ===

No official releases yet, just official snapshots. The first release is targetted for October, 2007.

=== Q: My mrxvt (terminal) fonts are huge. ===

Edit src/feature.h to set MIN_XFT_FONT_SIZE to lower value:
 #define MIN_XFT_FONT_SIZE           (2)
and rebuild mrxvt & openmoko-devel-image.

End edit /etc/mrxvt/mrxvt.conf
 Mrxvt.xftSize: 4
 Mrxvt.xftHint: 1

==Building 2007.2==

=== Why to build ===

Before getting your feet wet, step back a moment and ask yourself why you want to build the Openmoko distribution image. Chances are you are a kernel and application developer and just want to develop on your package -- in that case building Openmoko is completely unnecessary and a waste of time. You may rather want to use the Openmoko [[Toolchain]] and build only the stuff that is interesting to you.

=== How to build ===

The MokoMakefile is now able to build OM-2007.2 images.  If you use this new version of the MokoMakefile, you can ignore everything below and just continue building OM-2007.2 in the same way that you previously built images (i.e. according to [[MokoMakefile]]).  Make sure you set the generation correctly at the top of the file.

Follow the [http://www.openembedded.org/wiki/GettingStarted getting started] steps of OpenEmbedded. It is suggested to use Bitbake 1.8.8 at least.

{{note|Instead of using '''monotone.openembedded.org''' (as indicated in OE GettingStarted), please make sure to use '''monotone.openmoko.org''' as [[MonotoneServer|monotone server]].  This ensures you have a working revision of the metadata and will render a successful build}}

Put the following in your local.conf

 BBFILES = "${HOME}/oe/org.openembedded.dev/packages/*/*.bb"
 
 MACHINE = "om-gta01"
 DISTRO = "openmoko"
 
 ENABLE_BINARY_LOCALE_GENERATION = "1"
 GLIBC_GENERATE_LOCALES = "en_GB.UTF-8"

For multi-core machines, the following additions can be used for a speed-up (numbers should be tweaked based on the actual number of cores):

 PARALLEL_MAKE = "-j 4"
 BB_NUMBER_THREADS = "4"

To free disk space after builds, add:

 INHERIT += "rm_work"

Replace "${HOME}/oe" with the path to where your "org.openembeded.dev" folder lives. For the other entries have a look at ''conf/local.conf.sample'' about their meaning.

Run ''bitbake <package name>'' (e.g. openmoko-devel-image).

=== How to enable autorev ===

First apply the following patch to bitbake.

http://lists.linuxtogo.org/pipermail/openembedded-devel/2007-September/003035.html

Add the following line to your local.conf

  require conf/distro/include/moko-autorev.inc

Then run bitbake as normal. Openmoko will now build with latest SVN checkouts.

=== Build issues ===

==== Wrong certificate ====
You may get something like this while the bitbake recipes are parsed:

 Error validating server certificate for 'https://libw100.svn.sf.net:443':
  - The certificate hostname does not match.
  Certificate information:
   - Hostname: *.svn.sourceforge.net
   - Valid: from Fri, 27 Oct 2006 12:05:58 GMT until Sun, 28 Oct 2007 13:05:58 GMT
   - Issuer: Equifax Secure Certificate Authority, Equifax, US
   - Fingerprint: f2:6c:fe:bb:82:92:30:09:72:dd:1c:b3:e7:56:69:c7:7a:df:67:3e

That is an issue in a bitbake file. One should not use the short-name for sourceforge (sf.net) when certificates are only for exact host names. Accept the certificate and everything is fine for now.

==== openmoko-libs FTBFS ====
Some applications have not been fully modified to build with the new libraries of Openmoko and still need the old-style ''openmoko-libs'' package. ''libmokogsm'' which is needed for ''openmoko-libs'' then fails to build. As a workaround you can remove the not yet ported applications that need ''openmoko-libs'' making it unneccessary itself. To do this edit ''packages/tasks/openmoko-taks.bb'' and find the following lines:

 .
 .
 .
  openmoko-terminal \
  matchbox-panel-2 \
  matchbox-panel-2-applets \
  matchbox-applet-inputmanager \
 #  openmoko-appmanager \
  matchbox-keyboard \
  matchbox-stroke \
  openmoko-keyboard \
 .
 .
 .

Now put a hash (''#'') before ''openmoko-terminal'' and ''openmoko-keyboard''. You can verify that ''openmoko-libs'' is not needed any more by issuing ''bitbake -g openmoko-devel-image'' (= creates a dependency graph). There should be no mentioning of ''openmoko-libs'' in the file ''task-depends.dot''. '''Please note that the graphicall terminal and the virtual keyboard will be missing now.''' You can still have terminal access by following the [[USB Networking]] guide. For keyboard input in Qemu add the ''-usbdevice keyboard'' switch.


==== gtk+ fails building w/ gtkcombobox.c ====

If you get these errors:

Go to your /build/tmp/work/fic-gta01-angstrom-linux-gnueabi/gtk+-2.10.14-r3/gtk+-2.10.14/gtk directory, and patch gtkcombobox.c with the following:

==== Building glibc fails with a segfault in QEMU ====

If your build aborts and you see something like this:

 NOTE: package glibc-2.5: started
 NOTE: package glibc-2.5-r6: task do_package: started
 NOTE: preparing tree for binary locale generation
 NOTE: generating locale en_US (UTF-8)
 qemu: uncaught target signal 11 (Segmentation fault) - exiting
 
 ...
 
 NOTE: Tasks Summary: Attempted 271 tasks of which 0 didn't need to be rerun and 1 failed.
 ERROR: '/home/moko/oe/org.openembedded.dev/packages/glibc/glibc_2.5.bb' failed

Try editing your local.conf file.  Change:

 ENABLE_BINARY_LOCALE_GENERATION = "1"

to

 ENABLE_BINARY_LOCALE_GENERATION = "0"

and restart the build.  This may have some effect on internationalization (you will see a warning indicating that), but at least the build will continue.  Thanks to rwhitby for the tip.

Alternatively, as suggested by XorA in #openmoko, if you are running a 64-bit host distribution, try forcing a different QEMU rev, also in local.conf:

 PREFERRED_VERSION_qemu-native = "0.9.0+cvs20070701"
 SRCDATE_qemu-native = 20070701


==== libxml2-native fails with xmlCatalogPtr errors ====

Go to your build/tmp/work/i686-linux/libxml2-native-2.6.29-r1/libxml2-2.6.29/include/libxml/ directory and patch xmlversion.h with the following:

On my system the libxml2-native-2.6.29-r1 directory is in a directory named i686-linux, yours may be different. I believe this patch to be a workaround to make libxml2-native build. I am not yet sure what the consequences of enabling XML catalogue support are.




== Pre-built images ==

* http://buildhost.openmoko.org/OM2007.2/tmp/deploy/glibc/images/fic-gta01/ (broken link!)
* http://buildhost.openmoko.org/snapshots/2007.08/ (Official snapshots and ipkg repository)

=== Buildhost directory structure ===

The content of the Openmoko build server directory is available at
* http://buildhost.openmoko.org/OM2007.2/tmp/

It contains
* cache
** Internal caching data, not for human interpretation
* cross
** The cross-compilation toolchain used. You can download this and use it on your local machine.
* deploy
** deploy/images
*** The filesystem, kernel and bootloader images to be flashed into NAND
** deploy/ipk
*** the .ipk packages
* rootfs
** the extracted root filesystem. Please use the images from deploy/images instead
* staging
** no user servicable parts inside
* stamp
** internal state data
* work
** the actual build trees (including patches source code and binaries) of the individual packages

== Updating your image ==

Now that you have a functional 2007.2 image on your Neo, you will want to keep it updated.  Fortunately, ipkg is already set up to pull updated packages from the openmoko buildhost.

On the phone, in the terminal (or via ssh), if you have a live internet connection and DNS resolution set up in /etc/resolv.conf:

 ipkg update && ipkg upgrade

will bring your installed packages up to the most recent versions. Also have a look at alternative/additional ipkg sources at [[repositories]].

If you are also building your own images and packages, you can also run a simple httpd on your build host and serve your own ipkg files to the Neo.

On the build host, for example:

 thttpd -d <path_to_moko/tmp/deploy/glibc/ipk> -p 8080

will serve your packages on port 8080.

Then, on the neo, make a new file at /etc/ipkg/local-feed.conf with these contents:

 src/gz local-all http://192.168.0.200:8080/all
 src/gz local-armv4t http://192.168.0.200:8080/armv4t
 src/gz local-om-gta01 http://192.168.0.200:8080/om-gta01

and ipkg on the Neo (update-upgrade) will pick up files from your local build host's repository (assuming its IP address is 192.168.0.200, as is default in the [[USB Networking]] setup) in addition to the openmoko buildhost.

Or better yet, change the 192.168.0.200:8080 addresses above to the eth0 IP address of your build machine (instead of the usb0 IP address), and then you can access your local repository with your Neo plugged into any machine on your local net, or even via bluetooth.

Also if you are building your own packages or packages from the OE database that aren't part of Openmoko by default, you can install those packages as follows.

On the build host:

 bitbake <name_of_package>
 bitbake -crebuild package-index

Then on the Neo:

 ipkg update
 ipkg install <name_of_package>

The new package might not show up in the program menu until you reboot or restart X.
