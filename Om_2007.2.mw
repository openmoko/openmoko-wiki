'''Om 2007.2''' was the second version of the Openmoko distribution. Development began on 2007-07-26. This distribution is not developed anymore.

Goals of this version were an improved set of PIM applications, improved theming that fixes a lot of the usability problems of the first generation design, more formalized UI guidelines and a number of changes in the build system. The latter had the goal of introducing more recent software by staying closer in sync with upstream org.openembedded.dev.

An official announcement was made by Sean Moss-Pultz on August 20:
* http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/announce/2007-August/000018.html

(Initially this was named OM-2008 in SVN but renamed shortly after that.)

== Known Issues ==

For the very latest status, see [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/search?q=2007.2 all tickets with 2007.2] in the bug tracker.

===Missing Esc key===

With the default image you can't escape edit mode in vi due to the missing Esc key. You need to [[Switching_Keyboards|install a new on-screen keyboard]], and in order to do this you'll need to set up USB networking first. You can then SSH into the FreeRunner from your computer and use the keyboard on that computer to edit files in vi. 

Alternative on-screen keyboards feature an escape key.

If you are stuck in vi you can type <tt>:q</tt> or <tt>:q!</tt> to exit without saving, or <tt>ZZ</tt> to save and exit.

===Missing /, | and > keys===

These keys are missing from the 0 button. This can be fixed by editing <tt>/etc/multitap-pad/im-multipress.conf</tt>, see [[Switching_Keyboards#Fix_Default| this page]], but unfortunately you need vi, or some other editor to do so. Therefore you need to SSH in and [[Getting_Started_with_your_Neo_FreeRunner#Set_up_USB-based_networking_and_update|set up USB networking]] first.

Alternative on-screen keyboards should have these characters.

==="Signature Check Failed" errors when running `opkg update`===

The signatures are missing from the repository.

Workaround: If the Packages.gz files are downloading ok you can ignore this error.
After your first <tt>opkg upgrade</tt> you should get these signatures.

===The SSH / Dropbear connections over the USB link frequently freezes===

This happens when the phone goes to sleep after a few minutes. To unfreeze, unplug and replug the USB cable. To stop this from happening, press the Power button to get the Power menu, then choose Power Management: Disabled.

===My device is unresponsive. How do I perform a hard reset?===

For different boot methods, see [[Booting the Neo FreeRunner]].

===No GUI for controlling sound volume===

As of this writing, there is no way to adjust the volume from the screen.

Workaround:
Run the terminal application or [[USB_Networking|log in via usb]], and run the [[Neo alsamixer]] application. To see all the options, including Mic2, run
:alsamixer -V all
The mixer is simpler than it looks. Use the left and right arrow keys to select "headphone" or "PCM" and use the up and down arrow keys to adjust the volume.  You can also adjust your microphone volume with the "mic2" adjustment. Press ESC when finished. Then exit the terminal application or log out of the USB login.

You may need to update configuration files in 
:/usr/share/openmoko/scenarios/ 
to make the microphone setting permanent. type
:alsactl -f ''path-to-statefile'' store
to do this.

The default files are as follows (in /usr/share/openmoko/scenarios/): 
:gsmhandset.state
:gsmheadset.state
:gsmspeakerout.state
:headset.state
:stereoout.state

These correspond to the various Sound Profiles accessible in the Debug Tool under Applications.

To manually restore one of the state files,
:alsactl -f ''path-to-statefile'' restore

One way to increase the volume of the microphone is to do the following:
# ssh into your FreeRunner
# vi /usr/share/openmoko/scenarios/gsmhandset.state
# search for "Mic2"
# change to "value 3"
If people report not being able to hear you when you call, then setting the Mic2 value to 2 or 3 should fix that.

'''Question: I am using headphones but only the right speaker work the left don't work how can I fix this ?'''

This should be set correctly by restoring gsmheadset.state.
Pull and replug the headset jack to make sure the correct state-file is restored.
To manually control the switch between Speaker and headset:
Start alsamixer, scroll along to the right until you find "Amp Spk" and mute it (m), the sound will then come out from both channels of the 
headphones and not out of the speaker.

== Installing ==

If you want install this software distribution to your device, you have to follow these steps:
* Download the recent image of Om2007.2 .
* [[Flashing the Neo FreeRunner|Flash]] to your Neo FreeRunner

[[Image:Openmoko2007.2 home screen.png|thumb|right|home screen of Om 2007.2]]

==Building 2007.2==

=== Why to build ===

Before getting your feet wet, step back a moment and ask yourself why you want to build the Openmoko distribution image. Chances are you are a kernel and application developer and just want to develop on your package -- in that case building Openmoko is completely unnecessary and a waste of time. You may rather want to use the Openmoko [[Toolchain]] and build only the stuff that is interesting to you.

=== How to build ===

The MokoMakefile is now able to build Om 2007.2 images.  If you use this new version of the MokoMakefile, you can ignore everything below and just continue building Om 2007.2 in the same way that you previously built images (i.e. according to [[MokoMakefile]]).  Make sure you set the generation correctly at the top of the file.

Follow the [http://wiki.openembedded.net/index.php/Getting_Started getting started] steps of OpenEmbedded. It is suggested to use Bitbake 1.8.8 at least.

{{note|Instead of using '''git.openembedded.net''' (as indicated in OE GettingStarted), please make sure to use '''git://git.openmoko.org/git/openmoko''' as [[MonotoneServer|monotone server]].  This ensures you have a working revision of the metadata and will render a successful build}}

Put the following in your local.conf

BBFILES = "${HOME}/oe/org.openembedded.dev/packages/*/*.bb"

MACHINE = "om-gta01"
DISTRO = "openmoko"

ENABLE_BINARY_LOCALE_GENERATION = "1"
GLIBC_GENERATE_LOCALES = "en_GB.UTF-8"

For multi-core machines, the following additions can be used for a speed-up (numbers should be tweaked based on the actual number of cores):

PARALLEL_MAKE = "-j 4"
BB_NUMBER_THREADS = "4"

To free disk space after builds, add:

INHERIT += "rm_work"

Replace "${HOME}/oe" with the path to where your "org.openembedded.dev" folder lives. For the other entries have a look at ''conf/local.conf.sample'' about their meaning.

Run ''bitbake <package name>'' (e.g. openmoko-devel-image).

=== How to enable autorev ===

First apply the following patch to bitbake.

http://lists.linuxtogo.org/pipermail/openembedded-devel/2007-September/003035.html

Add the following line to your local.conf

require conf/distro/include/moko-autorev.inc

Then run bitbake as normal. Openmoko will now build with latest SVN checkouts.

=== Build issues ===

==== Wrong certificate ====
You may get something like this while the bitbake recipes are parsed:

Error validating server certificate for 'https://libw100.svn.sf.net:443':
- The certificate hostname does not match.
Certificate information:
- Hostname: *.svn.sourceforge.net
- Valid: from Fri, 27 Oct 2006 12:05:58 GMT until Sun, 28 Oct 2007 13:05:58 GMT
- Issuer: Equifax Secure Certificate Authority, Equifax, US
- Fingerprint: f2:6c:fe:bb:82:92:30:09:72:dd:1c:b3:e7:56:69:c7:7a:df:67:3e

That is an issue in a bitbake file. One should not use the short-name for sourceforge (sf.net) when certificates are only for exact host names. Accept the certificate and everything is fine for now.

==== openmoko-libs FTBFS ====
Some applications have not been fully modified to build with the new libraries of Openmoko and still need the old-style ''openmoko-libs'' package. ''libmokogsm'' which is needed for ''openmoko-libs'' then fails to build. As a workaround you can remove the not yet ported applications that need ''openmoko-libs'' making it unnecessary itself. To do this edit ''packages/tasks/openmoko-taks.bb'' and find the following lines:

.
.
.
openmoko-terminal \
matchbox-panel-2 \
matchbox-panel-2-applets \
matchbox-applet-inputmanager \
#  openmoko-appmanager \
matchbox-keyboard \
matchbox-stroke \
openmoko-keyboard \
.
.
.

Now put a hash (''#'') before ''openmoko-terminal'' and ''openmoko-keyboard''. You can verify that ''openmoko-libs'' is not needed any more by issuing ''bitbake -g openmoko-devel-image'' (= creates a dependency graph). There should be no mentioning of ''openmoko-libs'' in the file ''task-depends.dot''. '''Please note that the graphical terminal and the virtual keyboard will be missing now.''' You can still have terminal access by following the [[USB Networking]] guide. For keyboard input in Qemu add the ''-usbdevice keyboard'' switch.


==== gtk+ fails building w/ gtkcombobox.c ====

If you get these errors:

gtkcombobox.c: In function 'gtk_combo_box_size_request':

Go to your /build/tmp/work/fic-gta01-angstrom-linux-gnueabi/gtk+-2.10.14-r3/gtk+-2.10.14/gtk directory, and patch gtkcombobox.c with the following:

==== Building glibc fails with a segfault in QEMU ====

If your build aborts and you see something like this:

NOTE: package glibc-2.5: started
NOTE: package glibc-2.5-r6: task do_package: started
NOTE: preparing tree for binary locale generation
NOTE: generating locale en_US (UTF-8)
qemu: uncaught target signal 11 (Segmentation fault) - exiting

NOTE: Tasks Summary: Attempted 271 tasks of which 0 didn't need to be rerun and 1 failed.
ERROR: '/home/moko/oe/org.openembedded.dev/packages/glibc/glibc_2.5.bb' failed

Try editing your local.conf file.  Change:

ENABLE_BINARY_LOCALE_GENERATION = "1"

to

ENABLE_BINARY_LOCALE_GENERATION = "0"

and restart the build.  This may have some effect on internationalization (you will see a warning indicating that), but at least the build will continue.  Thanks to rwhitby for the tip.

Alternatively, as suggested by XorA in #openmoko, if you are running a 64-bit host distribution, try forcing a different QEMU rev, also in local.conf:

PREFERRED_VERSION_qemu-native = "0.9.0+cvs20070701"
SRCDATE_qemu-native = 20070701


==== libxml2-native fails with xmlCatalogPtr errors ====

Go to your build/tmp/work/i686-linux/libxml2-native-2.6.29-r1/libxml2-2.6.29/include/libxml/ directory and patch xmlversion.h with the following:

On my system the libxml2-native-2.6.29-r1 directory is in a directory named i686-linux, yours may be different. I believe this patch to be a workaround to make libxml2-native build. I am not yet sure what the consequences of enabling XML catalogue support are.

== Updating your image ==

'''REVIEW this section - buildhost is down, replaced. '''

Now that you have a functional 2007.2 image on your Neo, you will want to keep it updated.  Fortunately, ipkg is already set up to pull updated packages from the Openmoko buildhost.

On the phone, in the terminal (or via ssh), if you have a live internet connection and DNS resolution set up in /etc/resolv.conf:

ipkg update && ipkg upgrade

will bring your installed packages up to the most recent versions. Also have a look at alternative/additional ipkg sources at [[download]].

If you are also building your own images and packages, you can also run a simple httpd on your build host and serve your own ipkg files to the Neo.

On the build host, for example:

thttpd -d <path_to_moko/tmp/deploy/glibc/ipk> -p 8080

will serve your packages on port 8080.

Then, on the neo, make a new file at /etc/ipkg/local-feed.conf with these contents:

src/gz local-all http://192.168.0.200:8080/all
src/gz local-armv4t http://192.168.0.200:8080/armv4t
src/gz local-om-gta01 http://192.168.0.200:8080/om-gta01

and ipkg on the Neo (update-upgrade) will pick up files from your local build host's repository (assuming its IP address is 192.168.0.200, as is default in the [[USB Networking]] setup) in addition to the openmoko buildhost.

Or better yet, change the 192.168.0.200:8080 addresses above to the eth0 IP address of your build machine (instead of the usb0 IP address), and then you can access your local repository with your Neo plugged into any machine on your local net, or even via bluetooth.

Also if you are building your own packages or packages from the OE database that aren't part of Openmoko by default, you can install those packages as follows.

On the build host:

bitbake <name_of_package>
bitbake -crebuild package-index

Then on the Neo:

ipkg update
ipkg install <name_of_package>

The new package might not show up in the program menu until you reboot or restart X.
