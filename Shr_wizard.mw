This page discusses the needs and specifications for the shr wizard.

shr wizard is the "first launch wizard" for shr. It'll run the first time a user loads shr and helps him set many configuration values.

ATM I want it to set phoneutils, suggest installation of keyboard/locale but what else?

I suggest to let the user choose if he/she has a #1024 fixed phone or not (I keep forgetting to edit frameworkd.conf aftrt a clean install or upgrade and *suddenly* my battery drains rapidly)
