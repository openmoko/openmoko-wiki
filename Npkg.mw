This package manager was created to replace opkg in low memory environments. (openmoko/slugos/more?)

It will hopefully be both memory efficient and fast, though the emphasis is on memory efficiency, since we have unlimited time though not unlimited memory.

It is not yet in development, it's in the characterization stage. Please feel free to help, as this is the most important part.

Please read the introduction section

=Design choices=
It seems like using sqlite3 and libcurl are the best solutions for our purposes.
I'm considering using glib as well for data structures, though about that I'm still not sure and would like someone to help me think about pros and cons.

In conclusion:

Probable dependencies:
  # sqlite3
  # libcurl
