'''Troubleshooting:'''

Altough this statefile is supposed to be "the one" it seems it doesn't work perfectly for all models. Here are some hints you can try if you still have problems with audio during phonecalls:

* In case the other end complains about a rustling noise (like a flee would sit in the mic and move around) try correcting the "Mono Playback Volume" down. I have changed the value in the file to 89 and the phonecalls are now clear as they should be (On buzz-fixed A5).

* Some people reported it helps to set the Playbackvolume in FSO down a bit:
This will set the volume to 68%:
 mdbus -s org.freesmartphone.ogsmd /org/freesmartphone/GSM/Device org.freesmartphone.GSM.Device.SetSpeakerVolume 68
To read the current value:
 mdbus -s org.freesmartphone.ogsmd /org/freesmartphone/GSM/Device org.freesmartphone.GSM.Device.GetSpeakerVolume

* If it still doesn't work try fiddling around with the "Speaker Volume" in your statefile.
