== Timezone ==

To change the timezone on your Freerunner you have to 

 opkg install tzdata

and then install one of these

 tzdata-africa
 tzdata-americas
 tzdata-antarctica
 tzdata-arctic
 tzdata-asia 
 tzdata-atlantic
 tzdata-australia
 tzdata-europe
 tzdata-misc
 tzdata-pacific
 tzdata-posix  
 tzdata-right   

after that you have to change the TZ="UTC" in your /etc/profile
to the timezone you want

for Germany for example is it TZ="Europe/Berlin"
for France TZ="Europe/Paris"
and so on

after restart of your x-server with 

 /etc/init.d/xserver-nodm restart

you have the right timezone
