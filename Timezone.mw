== Timezone ==

At this time, there is no preferences application to set the timezone of your Openmoko device.

For now, either open the terminal application or log in to your Openmoko over the USB networking
connection and change the timezone via commandline commands.

To change the timezone on your FreeRunner you have to 

 opkg install tzdata

and then install one of these

 tzdata-africa
 tzdata-americas
 tzdata-antarctica
 tzdata-arctic
 tzdata-asia 
 tzdata-atlantic
 tzdata-australia
 tzdata-europe
 tzdata-misc
 tzdata-pacific
 tzdata-posix  
 tzdata-right

after that, you should create a symlink named /etc/localtime which points to the appropriate file in /usr/share/zoneinfo.  For example, if you're on the East Coast of the U.S., the following command will link the correct zoneinfo file to your /etc/localtime, giving you the correct time:

 ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York /etc/localtime

for Germany for example it is TZ="Europe/Berlin"
for France TZ="Europe/Paris"
and so on

Alternatively, you can take the more invasive approach and change the TZ="UTC" in your /etc/profile
to the timezone you want.

Once the timezone is set, restart of your x-server with 

 /etc/init.d/xserver-nodm restart

you should now have the right timezone.

In the future, expect the time zone to be set automatically by the telephone stack once connected to the network.

See also [[Date]] for setting the date and time.

===Debian===
Just use <code>dpkg-reconfigure tzdata</code>.
