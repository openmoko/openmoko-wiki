== Timezone ==

To change the timezone on your Freerunner you have to 

 opkg install tzdata

and then install one of these

 tzdata-africa
 tzdata-americas
 tzdata-antarctica
 tzdata-arctic
 tzdata-asia 
 tzdata-atlantic
 tzdata-australia
 tzdata-europe
 tzdata-misc
 tzdata-pacific
 tzdata-posix  
 tzdata-right

after that, you should create a symlink named /etc/localtime which points to the appropriate file in /usr/share/zoneinfo.  For example, if you're on the East Coast of the U.S., the following command will link the correct zoneinfo file to your /etc/localtime, giving you the correct time:

 ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York /etc/localtime

for Germany for example it is TZ="Europe/Berlin"
for France TZ="Europe/Paris"
and so on

Alternatively, you can take the more invasive approach and change the TZ="UTC" in your /etc/profile
to the timezone you want.

Once the timezone is set, restart of your x-server with 

 /etc/init.d/xserver-nodm restart

you should now have the right timezone.

See also [[Date]] for setting the date and time.
