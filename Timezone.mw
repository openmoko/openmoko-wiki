== Timezone ==

To change the timezone on your Freerunner you have to 

 opkg install tzdata

and then install one of these

 tzdata-africa
 tzdata-americas
 tzdata-antarctica
 tzdata-arctic
 tzdata-asia 
 tzdata-atlantic
 tzdata-australia
 tzdata-europe
 tzdata-misc
 tzdata-pacific
 tzdata-posix  
 tzdata-right   

after that you have to change the TZ="UTC" in your /etc/profile
to the timezone you want

for Germany for example is it TZ="Europe/Berlin"
for France TZ="Europe/Paris"
and so on

after restart of your x-server with 

 /etc/init.d/xserver-nodm restart

you have the right timezone

A second, less invasive method (unless you <i>like</i> modifying /etc/profile) is to symlink the appropriate timezone config file to /etc/localtime.  For example, if you're on the East Coast of the U.S., the following command will link the correct zoneinfo file to your /etc/localtime, giving you the correct time:

 ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York /etc/localtime

A x-server restart is still necessary for the window manager to pick up the new timezone.
