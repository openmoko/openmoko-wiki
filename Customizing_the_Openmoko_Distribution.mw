== What's the goal? ==

The goal of this page is to teach you how to take an application that you've coded (or the sample app) and properly get it included in your rootfs. This article is a bit of an aggregate page, it's going to take information from [[MokoMakefile]] [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/User:CesarB/Using_a_local_overlay Using_a_local_overlay] [[Building_a_hello_world_application]] and [[Create_a_package_from_existing_sources]]. So as you can see the goal is for it to be a very thorough introduction, and will take you from "Idea to Inclusion" of your application.
