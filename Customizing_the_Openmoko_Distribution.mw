== What's the goal? ==

The goal of this page is to teach you how to take an application that you've coded (or the sample app) and properly get it included in your rootfs. This article is a bit of an aggregate page, it's going to take information from [[MokoMakefile]] [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/User:CesarB/Using_a_local_overlay Using_a_local_overlay] [[Building_a_hello_world_application]] and [[Create_a_package_from_existing_sources]]. So as you can see the goal is for it to be a very thorough introduction, and will take you from "Idea to Inclusion" of your application.


== Setting Up the OpenMoko Environment ==

This part of the tutorial is going to be pretty basic. I absolutely love [[MokoMakefile]], it's fantastic, the creator has done and continues to do a fantastic job with this. I see absolutely no reason not to use it. However I cannot for the life of me understand why they create their working directory in /home/moko, the home directory is for home directories for users of your system, not for a development directory. I put my OpenMoko development directory in /home/bryce/mokodev/ and that works great for me, and also makes more sense so that multiple users on my machine could develop with no attempt to overlap.

To get your environment setup please get it setup according to [[MokoMakefile]] however if you do have the build environment setup manually and you're sure you know what you're doing then feel free to go forward with this.
