== Overview, what the hell is this page??? ==
This article focuses on configuring SHR(-unstable) image for a daily use in a german speaking area.
the author is Austrian so the main focus is on Austrian use.
with help of other users it is also useable for germany, switzerland.

to-do:
* get more feedback from people !!!
* get some of this stuff into main SHR branch


focus points (some are not provided by out-of-the-box SHR):
* GTA02 (sorry i dont have a GTA01)
* stable use as daily phone (calls, sms)
* keep install and use as simple as possbile
* keep reboot and crash frequency at 1/per day maximum (meaning only have to reboot once a day at most!)
* stable use as navigation device in german-speaking area, with understandable german speech
* only need to recharge once a day (meaning battery should hold 1 day in normal use)
* prevent neo usage from driving you crazy, because some litte things just don't work
* have all show-off and games stuff removed (it's fun for a while, but just a waste for everyday use)

== Installing ==
* have at least 1,5 hours of time ready, for the whole procedure
* have fast internet, you need to download lots of stuff

=== Downloading Bootloader, Kernel, Root Image ===
* download exactly these versions of '''[[SHR]]''' from z0ph
     '''1.''' [http://work.zoff.cc/openmoko/shr/de_at/qi.udfu] qi boot loader (~30 KB)

     '''2.''' [http://work.zoff.cc/openmoko/shr/de_at/uImage.bin] kernel (kernöl ~2 MB)

     '''3.''' [http://work.zoff.cc/openmoko/shr/de_at/rootfs.jffs2] root image (~70 MB)

These are the original names of the files:
 qi-s3c2442-1.0.2+gitr3b8513d8b3d9615ebda605de4bda18371aa3f359.udfu

 shr-lite-glibc-ipk--20090808-om-gta02.rootfs.jffs2

 uImage-2.6.29-oe11+gitr119838+2d158aae9d8d36f575504f59884ed8e80802efe2-r3.5-om-gta02

===Flashing Neo===
* flash '''[[qi]]''', '''[[kernel]]''' and root image to your neo (i tested this on '''[[GTA02]]'''v6). Detailed instructions for [[Flashing_the_Neo_Freerunner|Freerunner]]
The installation should be flashing like (do it in DFU mode of NOR u-boot):
  dfu-util -a u-boot -R -D qi.udfu
  dfu-util -a kernel -R -D uImage.bin
  dfu-util -a rootfs -R -D rootfs.jffs2

* HINT:
i have found that (against what others say!) using the NAND for root-fs is the fastest and most relyable way. having the root-fs on the SD-card is slower and also files get suddenly lost or corrupt.

===if you have an SD-card with ext2/ext3 partitions (optional step!!)===
Maybe you installed other [[Distributions]] on your OpenMoko before and you have EXT2 or EXT3 partition on you SD card and want FAT partition, then install <tt>dosfstools</tt> on your Neo to have <tt>mkfs.vfat</tt> available.
  opkg install dosfstools

Format SD card (resp. partition) if and only if the format is not FAT and you want a FAT partition on your SD card.
  mkfs.vfat -v -n maps-data /dev/mmcblk0p1

== Startup ==
* boot up your neo, and let it run until you are logged in to your GSM net

on 1st boot, when asked choose:

<== put nice screenshots here ==>

 Language --> choose: english --> press next
 Profile --> choose: Illume SHR --> pres next
 Menus --> choose: System Default --> pres next
 Quick Launch --> check NO box !! --> pres next
 Ok :-)

* then shutdown the neo (press and hold power button for a few seconds)
* boot up your neo again, and let the neo log in to your GSM network again.

==Customization Package==
===Preparing your SD card (you need to do this!)===
login to your neo as root
and make the base dir
 cd /media/card
 mkdir "____shr_testing"

===Customization Pack WITHOUT Maps for Navit===
download customize pack without navit maps and transfer this file to your Freerunner via sftp.
     [http://work.zoff.cc/openmoko/shr/de_at/customize_pack_shr_no_maps.tar.gz customize pack without maps] (11 MBytes)
Or use wget from your neo if you have internet connection (e.g. via USB established)
  cd /media/card/____shr_testing
  wget http://work.zoff.cc/openmoko/shr/de_at/customize_pack_shr_no_maps.tar.gz # 11 MBytes

===Unpack Customization Pack===
transfer the customize pack to your SD-Card (to /media/card/____shr_testing/)
then login to your neo as root

 cd /media/card/____shr_testing/
 gzip -d customize_pack_shr_no_maps.tar.gz
 tar -xf customize_pack_shr_no_maps.tar

===Download the Navit Maps===
login to your neo as root
to download (or update!!) the austrian map file do (you need fast internet on your neo):
 cd /media/card/____shr_testing/navit/
 ./get_austria.map.sh # this will download about 350 MBytes!!

for germany:

 cd /media/card/____shr_testing/navit/
 ./get_germany.map.sh # this will download about 380 MBytes!!

for switzerland:

 cd /media/card/____shr_testing/navit/
 ./get_germany.map.sh # this will download about 80 MBytes!!

or to download your map manually, visit:
 http://maps.navit-project.org/download/
and put it in this directory /media/card/____shr_testing/navit/
and navit will use it automatically


or have a look at some preconfigured downloads:
 http://maps.navit-project.org/api/map/


at the moment you can have '''ONLY 1 .bin''' map file in that directory.
i guess this is a navit bug?

== Localize it ==
* for '''GOD's sake try NOT to get any phonecalls''' while you do this part
* now connect your neo with usb and login via ssh
* you '''NEED internet on your neo''' for this, otherwise dependent packages can't be downloaded
* start (as root on your neo):

 cd /media/card/____shr_testing/
 ./init_shr_testing.sh

* this will take some time !! have coffee ready :-)
* wait for the customize script to finish
* now at least reboot 1 time (better 2 times)
* '''[UG1]''' now start (also as root on your neo):
 opkg update
 opkg upgrade -force-defaults

* dependency issue
(Sep. 28th 2009) upgrade stop with the following collected errors:
  ERROR: Cannot satisfy the following dependencies for fsousaged:
    libfso-glib0 (>= 0.2.1+gitr47+7608c8d98bb65bb5beca6621eb86920b71df1bc9) *

to fix this try:
 opkg update
 opkg install libfso-glib0
 opkg upgrade -force-defaults
or:
 opkg update
 opkg install http://build.shr-project.org/shr-unstable/ipk/armv4t/libfso-glib0_0.2.1+gitr47+7608c8d98bb65bb5beca6621eb86920b71df1bc9-r0_armv4t.ipk
 opkg upgrade -force-defaults


* '''[UG2]''' when finished start as root:
 cd /media/card/____shr_testing/
 ./do_upgrade_shr.sh
* hopefully no errors have occured
* '''[UG1]''' '''[UG2]''' repeat those 2 steps every few days, if you want (dare) to receive all the bleeding edge updates

== Test it ==
* reboot your neo, and let the neo login to your GSM network
* now navit should have austrian maps, and speak in german to you :-)
* you can suspend/resume anytime! even when navit is speaking! yeah really, it works
* date and time should also be correct
* press AUX button quick and zedlock should come up, draw a big "Z" to unlock again
* hold POWER button for 2 seconds, and neo will shutdown
* if shutdown with POWER button fails, go to illume home screen, pull down the menu and press the big red "X", a menu should appear

== Test it (german) ==
* Navit sollte alles in deutsch anzeigen, österreichkarten laden und vor allem der Neo sollte beim Laufen von Navit nicht blanken oder suspenden.

== Startup Times ==

{| style="color:#FCFCFC; cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" border="1"
|0:00
|press button to boot neo
|-
|0:17
|splash logo visible

|enlightenment splash screen visible
|-
|2:02
|illume topshelf visible
|-
|2:28
|illume desktop icons visible

those times seem pretty catastophic in comparison to a normal mobile phone
yet for the neo they are really not so bad :-)

== Feedback ==
* please give some [[Talk:Configure_SHR_for_Austrian_use|feedback]]

== Features ==

=== Installed Programs ===

* German keyboard, with German dictionary (word list)
* Gridpad keyboard (if you want this you can set it in the enlightenment config "wrench" under Keyboard section)
* Cellhunter
on first start choose language (german i guess), then enter name and password.
can be anything, and you really don't need to remember it later.
if you can't get AGPS working where you are, just wait for a GPS fix and upload that data to cellhunter. now you can instantly use it for AGPS, isn't that nice ...
* GPSagps
refresh agps data from u-blox.com (and [[cellhunter]]), you need an
[[GTA02_GPS#u-blox_Assist_Now_account_application|account]] there (its free)

you can configure it in /etc/agps-online.conf

sample /etc/agps-online.conf:
 [config]
 user=XX@YY.com
 password=mypassword

* Midori
small webbrowser, usable but not really the best
* <del>Moko...</del>
<del>mokomaze, you might know it from some mobile phones</del>
* Mokon...
Mokonnect, scans for WLAN networks, and does some other stuff (i have NOT yet successfully connected to any WLAN networks)
* [[Navit]]
Navit version from SVN. it shows full austria,german und switzerland map. speaks to you in german. it takes almost all CPU you have, so don't push it too far. otherwise it works very well.
* Settings
shr-settings from SHR. runs really fine. I just made some small changes
* Terminal
valaterm
* Water
Water level
* agpsUI
use this great program ONLY as a last resort. it does NOT play well together with FSO and frameworkd
* Intone...
Intone music player. put your music files in /media/card/music/ directory
* zedlock (no icon, use AUX button)
great screen locker. draw a big "Z" on the screen in 1 second to unlock screen
* gpe-scap (no icons, only command line)
login via ssh to your neo. start 
  export DISPLAY=:0 ; gpe-scap
on commandline to make a screenshot.
* sms-sentry (no icon, send sms)
Send sms with text "sentry<passwd>:location" to your neo, and get an sms with current position back. default passwd is '12345'. you can confiure it in /etc/sms-sentry

sample /etc/sms-sentry:
 [config]
 password=54321
