This article focuses on configuring SHR for german language. Localization for Austria is relevant according to the downloaded maps (navit) adn dictionary for Austria. Changing the script for downloading maps from e.g.
* Switzerland or
* Germany
will adapt this work for any german speaking country.

|first version with austrian stuff, and focus on everyday usability
|-
|2009-09-12
|based on SHR unstable, and with opkg upgrade support
|}

== Installing ==
* have at least 1,5 hours of time ready, for the whole procedure
* have fast internet, you need to download lots of stuff
===Downloading Bootloader, Kernel, Root Image===
* download exactly these versions of '''[[SHR]]''' from z0ph
     '''1.''' [http://work.zoff.cc/openmoko/shr/de_at/qi.udfu] qi boot loader

     '''2.''' [http://work.zoff.cc/openmoko/shr/de_at/uImage.bin] kernel (kernöl)

     '''3.''' [http://work.zoff.cc/openmoko/shr/de_at/rootfs.jffs2] root image

These are the original names of the files:
 qi-s3c2442-1.0.2+gitr3b8513d8b3d9615ebda605de4bda18371aa3f359.udfu

 shr-lite-glibc-ipk--20090808-om-gta02.rootfs.jffs2

 uImage-2.6.29-oe11+gitr119838+2d158aae9d8d36f575504f59884ed8e80802efe2-r3.5-om-gta02

===Flashing Neo===
* flash '''[[qi]]''', '''[[kernel]]''' and root image to your neo (i tested this on '''[[GTA02]]'''v6). Detailed instructions for [[Flashing_the_Neo_Freerunner|Freerunner]]
The installation should be flashing like (do it in DFU mode of NOR u-boot):
  dfu-util -a u-boot -R -D qi.udfu
  dfu-util -a kernel -R -D uImage.bin
  dfu-util -a rootfs -R -D rootfs.jffs2

===Customization Package===
* make the base dir
 cd /media/card
 mkdir "____shr_testing"
* download customize pack from z0ph
     '''Option 1:''' [http://work.zoff.cc/openmoko/shr/de_at/customize_pack_shr.tar.gz customize pack with maps] (48 MBytes)
Or use wget from your neo if you have internet connection (e.g. via USB established)
  cd /media/card/____shr_testing
  wget http://work.zoff.cc/openmoko/shr/de_at/customize_pack_shr.tar.gz
* you can instead download customize pack without navit maps, its a bit smaller

     '''Option 2:''' [http://work.zoff.cc/openmoko/shr/de_at/customize_pack_shr_no_maps.tar.gz customize pack without maps] (20 MBytes)
  cd /media/card/____shr_testing
  wget http://work.zoff.cc/openmoko/shr/de_at/customize_pack_shr_no_maps.tar.gz

* unpack the customize pack to your SD-Card (to /media/card/____shr_testing/). my /media/card partition is type VFAT

 cd /media/card/____shr_testing/
 gzip -d customize_pack_shr.tar.gz
 tar -xf customize_pack_shr.tar

* to download (or update!!) the austrian map file later do (you need fast internet on your neo):
 cd /media/card/____shr_testing/navit/
 ./get_austria.map.sh # this will download about 350 MBytes!!

== Startup ==
* boot up your neo, and let it run until you are logged in to your GSM net
* then shutdown the neo (press and hold power button for a few seconds)
* boot up your neo again, and let the neo log in to your GSM network again.

== Localize for AT ==
* for '''GOD's sake try NOT to get any phonecalls''' while you do this part
* now connect your neo with usb and login via ssh
* you '''NEED internet on your neo''' for this, otherwise dependent packages can't be downloaded
* start (as root on your neo):

 cd /media/card/____shr_testing/
 ./init_shr_testing.sh

* this will take some time !! have coffee ready :-)
* wait for the customize script to finish
* now at least reboot 1 time (better 2 times)
* '''[UG1]''' now start (also as root on your neo):
 opkg update; opkg upgrade -force-defaults
* '''[UG2]''' when finished start as root:
 cd /media/card/____shr_testing/
 ./do_upgrade_shr.sh
* hopefully no errors have occured
* '''[UG1]''' '''[UG2]''' repeat those 2 steps every few days, if you want (dare) to receive all the bleeding edge updates

== Test it ==
* reboot your neo, and let the neo login to your GSM network
* now navit should have austrian maps, and speak in german to you :-)
* you can suspend/resume anytime! even when navit is speaking! yeah really, it works
* date and time should also be correct
* press AUX button quick and zedlock should come up, draw a big "Z" to unlock again
* hold POWER button for 2 seconds, and neo will shutdown
* if shutdown with POWER button fails, go to illume home screen, pull down the menu and press the big red "X", a menu should appear

== Test it (german) ==
* Navit sollte alles in deutsch anzeigen, österreichkarten laden und vor allem der Neo sollte beim Laufen von Navit nicht blanken oder suspenden.

== Startup Times ==

{| style="color:#FCFCFC; cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" border="1"
|0:00

those times seem pretty catastophic in comparison to a normal mobile phone
yet for the neo they are really not so bad :-)

== Feedback ==

== Features ==

=== Installed Programs ===

* German keyboard, with German dictionary (word list)
* Gridpad keyboard (if you want this you can set it in the enlightenment config "wrench" under Keyboard section)
* Cellhunter
on first start choose language (german i guess), then enter name and password.
can be anything, and you really don't need to remember it later.
if you can't get AGPS working where you are, just wait for a GPS fix and upload that data to cellhunter. now you can instantly use it for AGPS, isn't that nice ...
* GPSagps
refresh agps data from u-blox.com (and [[cellhunter]]), you need an
[[GTA02_GPS#u-blox_Assist_Now_account_application|account]] there (its free)

you can configure it in /etc/agps-online.conf

sample /etc/agps-online.conf:
 [config]
 user=XX@YY.com
 password=mypassword

* Midori
small webbrowser, usable but not really the best
* Moko...
mokomaze, you might know it from some mobile phones
* Mokon...
Mokonnect, scans for WLAN networks, and does some other stuff (i have NOT yet successfully connected to any WLAN networks)
* [[Navit]]
Navit version from SVN. it shows full austria,german und switzerland map. speaks to you in german. it takes almost all CPU you have, so don't push it too far. otherwise it works very well.
* Settings
shr-settings from SHR. runs really fine. I just made some small changes
* Terminal
valaterm
* Water
Water level
* agpsUI
use this great program ONLY as a last resort. it does NOT play well together with FSO and frameworkd
* Intone...
Intone music player. put your music files in /media/card/music/ directory
* zedlock (no icon, use AUX button)
great screen locker. draw a big "Z" on the screen in 1 second to unlock screen
* gpe-scap (no icons, only command line)
login via ssh to your neo. start "export DISPLAY=:0 ; gpe-scap" on commandline to make a screenshot
* sms-sentry (no icon, send sms)
send sms with text "sentry<passwd>:location" to your neo, and get an sms with current position back. default passwd is '12345'. you can confiure it in /etc/sms-sentry

sample /etc/sms-sentry:
 [config]
 password=54321
