Video is problematic.

On the minus side.
*The CPU is certainly not fast enough to decode 480*640 video.
*The display is portrait, which means that an additional rotation step is needed for most landscape video, adding to CPU usage.
*Downloading an arbitrary video, and playing it without transcoding it, then playing it later will not be possible.
However.

On the positive side.
*The LCD can be switched to a 240*320 stretch mode, which is much less taxing.
*Re-encoding video to rotate it, and scale to 320*240, and encoding with a low CPU use codec such as MPEG-1 may well make half-screen doubled videos playable at 25fps.
*If not, then it almost certainly will be possible at 12fps.
*Playing most very small - postage stamp - videos as are sent by many phones should be possible.
*1G of storage should give several hours of mpeg4 video, as the quality can be reduced somewhat without being visible on the screen.

From a conversation with XorA, in the [irc://freenode.com/#openmoko IRC channel].

400kbps mpeg4 works on a 200Mhz neo (without sound) on prerotated 240*320 ffmpeg codec videos, at 25fps, using stock mplayer.

With sound, this drops to 18fps.

There are optimisations for mplayer that look promising to get 25fps with sound.
