Not a proper 'app' page, just an overview

=FreeRunner=
It plays mpeg-4 320x240 stretched fullscreen, however other formats will require transcoding.

==Playback==
The default media player doesn't seem to handle video very well, but mplayer does OK.

=== Using standard Mplayer ===
It can be installed with the following command:
opkg install mplayer

=== Using the Glamo XV acceleration ===
TBD, refer to: http://unadventure.wordpress.com/2008/06/08/accelerating-in-my-pocket/

=== Controlling MPlayer from the Touchscreen ===
Create a file in /home/root/.mplayer/input.conf with this content:
# Freerunner Optimizations
MOUSE_BTN0 vo_fullscreen
MOUSE_BTN0_DBL q
Now, you can toggle the fullscreen by tapping the screen and exit from mplayer by touble-tapping the LCD.
Accelerometers or hardware buttons could help more.

=== Playback helper script ===

Create a script named 'vidplay' in your home directory with the following commands:
#!/bin/sh
xrandr -display :0 --output default --mode 240x320
mplayer -vo fbdev "$1" > /dev/null
xrandr -display :0 --output default --mode 480x640
reset

Make the script executable:
chmod 755 /home/root/vidplay

Known issues with this approach:
*The output isn't in a proper window, so background stuff sometimes flickers through.
*When done on the local terminal the keyboard is obscured so you can't exit.  SSH works quite well.
*240x320 mode has some quirks:
**The gamma/brightness/contrast is weird.  Encoding adjustments into the media is a workaround.
**Vertical banding (as seen in landscape position) is quite noticeable.
*Using CTRL-C to exit vidplay doesn't reset the screen; use 'q' instead.

Despite these issues, it proves that the horsepower is there and it can be done.


=== Another derivated method : works like a charm for me ! ===
No ssh, no xrandr, no script needed, juste mplayer and qwerty keyboard :
Like it's said in the "Getting started with FreeRunner" wiki page, you have to install the full qwerty keyboard, see [http://www.ginguppin.de/node/15 these instructions].
After that, you can go to Terminal and type :
mplayer vid/my_video.avi
Mplayer starts in full screen, if your video is optimized like below 240x320 it's work like a charm and to quit just use the power button.

Only issue : You can't forward/backward/pause...

==Example - Big Buck Bunny==
===PC===
Download the source (no need to start with the giant full resolution version)
cd /tmp
wget http://proyectos.pixelamigo.com/open/movies/BigBuckBunny/unofficial_PSP/big_buck_bunny_480p_AVC_FW33.mp4

Test the video filter settings (-vf crop=...) often omitting the last "rotate=2" (Optional, but recommended for long videos).
mplayer big_buck_bunny_480p_AVC_FW33.mp4 -vf crop=720:480:-1:-1,scale=320:-2,rotate=2 -zoom

Transcode it
mencoder big_buck_bunny_480p_AVC_FW33.mp4 -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4:vhq:vbitrate=300 \
-vf crop=720:480:0:0,scale=320:-2,eq2=1.2:0.5:-0.25,rotate=2 -oac mp3lame -lameopts br=64:cbr \
-o big_buck_bunny_320.avi

or if it doesn't work(for me the image and the colours aren't ok) replace scale=320:-2 by scale=320:240

=== FreeRunner===
Transfer the resulting 27M file from the PC to the FreeRunner's MicroSD card
scp user@192.168.0.200:/tmp/big_buck_bunny_320.avi /media/card

Play it
/home/root/vidplay /media/card/big_buck_bunny_320.avi

==Other Info==

To rotate the screen:
xrandr -o 0
xrandr -o 1

=Neo1973=

Video is problematic on [[Neo 1973]].

On the minus side.
*The CPU is certainly not fast enough to decode 480*640 video.
*The display is portrait, which means that an additional rotation step is needed for most landscape video, adding to CPU usage.
*Downloading an arbitrary video, and playing it without transcoding it, then playing it later will not be possible.
However.

On the positive side.
*The LCD can be switched to a 240*320 stretch mode, which is much less taxing.
*Re-encoding video to rotate it, and scale to 320*240, and encoding with a low CPU use codec such as MPEG-1 may well make half-screen doubled videos playable at 25fps.
*If not, then it almost certainly will be possible at 12fps.

==Mode Switching==
For switching between QVGA and VGA mode do the following with a compatible kernel:
chvt 4 && echo qvga-normal > /sys/devices/platform/s3c24xx-spi-gpio.1/spi0.0/state && fbset qvga
vice versa:
echo normal > /sys/devices/platform/s3c24xx-spi-gpio.1/spi0.0/state && fbset vga && chvt 3
taken from http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/neo1973-hardware/2007-October/000267.html

To avoid console blanking type
echo -e '\033[9;0]' > /dev/ttyX
where 'X' is your terminal number - for example if you did chvt 4 then /dev/tty4 is your terminal.

To avoid kernel output in vt do
echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/printk

==User Reports==
From a conversation with XorA, in the [irc://freenode.com/#openmoko IRC channel].

400kbps mpeg4 works on a 200Mhz neo (without sound) on prerotated 240*320 ffmpeg codec videos, at 25fps, using stock mplayer.

With sound, this drops to 18fps.

There are optimisations for mplayer that look promising to get 25fps with sound.

==Playback using 480x640 / 640x480==

To get best speed on GTA01 (best size-speed-resolution-codec trade-off I could find - doesn't mean it's perfect though) crosscode using:
mencoder <sourcefile> -o <targetfile.avi> -ofps 13 -vf scale -zoom -xy 240 -af channels=1:0:0:1:0 -oac lavc -ovc lavc -lavcopts acodec=mp3:vcodec=h263p:autoaspect=1:vbitrate=300:abitrate=32

Also working okay:
mencoder <sourcefile> -o <targetfile.avi> -ofps 13 -vf scale -zoom -xy 352 -af channels=1:0:0:1:0 -oac lavc -ovc lavc -lavcopts acodec=mp3:vcodec=h263p:autoaspect=1:vbitrate=200:abitrate=32

You can playback the file using:
mplayer -sws 0 -nodouble -vo sdl -fs -framedrop <tagetfile.avi>

You may also want to use:
-autosync 30 -vf scale -zoom -xy 640 -vf rotate=1

=Transcoding=
To make your videos/DVDs compatible use mencoder like this:
Find out the -vf cropping parameters with
mplayer input.avi -vf cropdetect
let it run a few seconds and insert the given cropping values into this command
mencoder input.avi -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4:vhq:vbitrate=300 -vf crop=xx:xx:xx:xx,rotate=2,scale=-2:320 -oac mp3lame -lameopts br=64:cbr -o output2.avi
To encode a DVD first find out the -vf cropping parameters with
mplayer -dvd-device /path/to/dvd dvd:// -vf cropdetect -sb 50000000
let it run a few seconds and insert the given cropping values into this command
mencoder -dvd-device /path/to/dvd dvd:// -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4:vhq:vbitrate=300 -vf crop=xx:xx:xx:xx,rotate=2,scale=-2:320 -oac mp3lame -lameopts br=64:cbr -o output.avi
This will rotate the video/DVD, scale it and encode it to mpeg4 with a bitrate of 300kBit/s. Works like a charm.

=Frontend=
==gnome-mplayer==
'''Source Code released: No'''

As a nice GUI gnome-mplayer can be recommended.

On Debian you can install it from repository:
# apt-get install gnome-mplayer
