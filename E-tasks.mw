==Introduction==

 e-tasks is a task manager written in C and based on elementary and sqlite. 

Currently basic functionality works. I will be adding the ability to set reminders soon.

==Usage==
Usage Tips:
* Selecting a task shows its data in the topmost line where you can change the priority, task and date.
* To save changes, click on the save button or select another task. 
* Task Categories can be selected by clicking on the 'All Tasks' hover button. 
* The details button allows task editing as well as setting its category. This will soon also allow setting its reminder
* The Add button adds a task.
* The Category Hover ("All Tasks" button) lets you change the category of tasks being shown on the main page.
* From the category hover you can
  - see the deleted tasks.
  - edit the categories.
* Once the button is pressed - click anywhere else but on the buttons that show up - closes the hover.
