==Introduction==

 e-tasks is a task manager written in C and based on elementary and sqlite. 

Currently basic functionality works. I will be adding the ability to set reminders soon.

==Usage==

Selecting a task shows its data in the topmost line where you can change the priority, task and date.
To save changes, click on the save button or select another task. 
Task Categories can be selected by clicking on the 'All Tasks' hover button. 
The details button allows task editing as well as setting its category. This will soon also allow setting its reminder

==Libraries==

libelementary and libsqlite3.

===To Install===

opkg install libelementary0 libsqlite3-0 http://www.opkg.org/packages/e-tasks_0.10_arm.ipk
