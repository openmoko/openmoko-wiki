From the README:
The menu can  be controlled by clicking the frame borders. Touching the  inner
part  of the  screen is like a button  press. In the game  mode a  click
in  the upper right corner activates pause mode and the lower right
corner escapes to the menu.

The four corners of the screen and then the centre of the screen are 5 different "buttons". Trial and error means someone will eventually work out which is which and document it here.
