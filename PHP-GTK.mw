PHP-GTK is an extension for PHP, which enables you to write real applications with a GTK-interface. This works very well on the OpenMoko, and some applications have already been written.


[http://derickrethans.nl/who.php Derick Rethans] has ported PHP and PHP-GTK for the OpenMoko, which you can read more about on [http://derickrethans.nl/index.php his blog] in [http://derickrethans.nl/php_on_openmoko.php this post].


There has already been set up a repository called [[Knjrepository]], which includes these packages.
