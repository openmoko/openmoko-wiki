== What is it? ==

[http://gtk.php.net PHP-GTK] is an extension for [http://php.net PHP], which enables you to write real applications with a GTK-interface in PHP. This works really well on the Openmoko, and some applications have already been written.

== Hello World example ==
 <?php
  dl("php_gtk2.so");
  
  class MyWindow{
    function __construct(){
      $this->window = new GtkWindow();
      $this->label = new GtkLabel("Hello world");
      $this->window->add($this->label);
      $this->window->show_all();
    }
  }
  
  $my_window = new MyWindow();
  Gtk::main();
 ?>


== How to get it? ==

[http://derickrethans.nl/who.php Derick Rethans] has ported PHP and PHP-GTK for the OpenMoko, which you can read more about on [http://derickrethans.nl/index.php his blog] in [http://derickrethans.nl/php_on_openmoko.php this post].

There has already been set up a repository called [[Knjrepository]] by [[User:Kaspernj|Kaspernj]], which includes these packages amongst many others.
