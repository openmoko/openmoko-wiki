== Personal Wiki ==

The application I use most frequently on the Palm Pilot is [http://www.acrocat.com/AcroWiki/default.asp?lang=en AcroWiki].  It's a simple wiki that runs self-contained on the Palm Pilot.  It's major strength is that it uses the standard Memo Pad database, so the content is available to everything that uses the MemoPad database or synchronizes with it.  I also had it syncing with an corporate intranet, although that was a pain to set up.
