This describes how to update your openmoko to the latest software. We'll update the kernel, the root filesystem and the u-boot (new uboot is neccessary, because otherwise you get kernel crashes later -- with phase0 uboot, anyway).

Neccessary files are at http://buildhost.openmoko.org/tmp/deploy/images/ .

Download dfu-util, openmoko-devel-image-fic-gta01-20070501054014.rootfs.jffs2 , 
uImage-2.6.21.1-moko10-r0_0_1883_0-fic-gta01.bin, u-boot-gta01bv3-r5_9877d7dcd1eebe61aa5d8b8ffe9c048ea426e6f6_0_1910.bin for phase0 machine. You may want to take the latest versions.

You'll need to boot your openmoko into uboot menu (hold emergency button while pressing power button). Unplug all other usb devices from the host.

Double check that u-boot matches your hardware version. Flashing u-boot is really a critical part.

Use ./dfu-util -a 1 -R -D u-boot-gta01bv3-r5_9877d7dcd1eebe61aa5d8b8ffe9c048ea426e6f6_0_1910.bin to update the uboot.

Use ./dfu-util -a 3 -R -D ./uImage-2.6.21.1-moko10-r0_0_1883_0-fic-gta01.bin to update the kernel.

Use ./dfu-util -a 5 -R -D ./openmoko-devel-image-fic-gta01-20070501054014.rootfs.jffs2 to update the root filesystem. 

Old versions of uboot are buggy: You may have to press the aux button few times so that machine does not sleep while flashing. It also does not erase rootfs before flashing it... to do that, do minicom /dev/ttyACM0, then nand erase clean rootfs . Unfortunately, old versions of uboot are not really usable, because they fail to enable high 64MB of RAM, and you get nasty crashes after kernel boots.

Good luck!
