=== Problem: it takes a long time (10min+) before the Freerunner gets first GPS data ===

It was found that the OpenMoko FreeRunner GPS has a long Time To First Fix (TTFF) with the SD card in the phone. [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-July/021774.html This thread] indicates that there is interference from the SD card slot, as without the SD card inserted it the TTFF are much shorter.

::More specific: the GPS signal level drops by -20dBm, i.e. factor 100. Signal strength of a GPS satellite above your head is around -127dBm. Needed strength for a first fix is -145dBm with a minimum of three satellites. Once the GPS chip has a fix, it can operate at signal levels of -157dBm, thus making it possible to operate while there is data transfer from/to the SD card.
