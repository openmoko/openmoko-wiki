[[User:starox|I]] started a project named Mokofuel on openmoko to replace pfuel on palmos.
If you're interested in, please contact me at "fredo __please_replace_this_with_at_ starox.org".

Technically, it uses an ui glade file for ui and I'm digging sqlite for backend. One database file per vehicle.
I hope using .glade files, allow me to keep the same codebase to develop both pda and desktop application.

I'had moved, and currently, I'm without internet connection. But I can read and write mail as well surfing at work.

I'll be back asap and keep maintaining this page.

If you will or you had started a similar project, please inform me.
