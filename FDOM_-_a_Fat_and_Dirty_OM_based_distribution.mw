=== Description ===
A combination of apps and fixes to demo the capabilities of the Freerunner and to have a functional phone (sort of). This all while retaining the ability to update through the official feeds.

=== Development ===
I you want to come to the script kidding party :) join us at 

http://projects.openmoko.org/projects/fdom/

Serious developers are welcome too :) but remember  "if it's cool, it works(in some way),doesn't annoying(too much) rest of things and fits on the nand it's in" :) we will let scalability, stability, resource saving and so on to the OM guys :)  
 
=== Warnings ===
* If after an opkg update/upgrade dialer, contacts and other qtopia-x11 apps don't work and qpe shows an error window you should check whether the startup file is executable, or revert changes.

The following adds permissions of '''r'''ead and e'''x'''ecution to the qtopia startup session file:
 # chmod a+rx /etc/X11/Xsession.d/89qtopia

The following reverts last change to the qtopia startup session file:
 # cp /etc/X11/Xsession.d/89qtopia.bk~ /etc/X11/Xsession.d/89qtopia

Now reboot the neo.

==== 15 Sep Updates ====
* It seems that there were major updates today that caused dialer to not work , It does happen when you click on dialer and it does exit with Enlightenment error , qucik fix to this is 

 # ln /opt/Qtopia/bin/qcop /usr/bin/qcop -s

but i believe adding /opt/Qtopia/bin to global system path is better solution (How?).

=== Changelog ===
==== version  20080913 ====
* added Pidgin -> Instant Messaging multiprotocol, installed with plugins for irc and xppm/googletalk. More plugins are avaible on the amstrong repository. There are some gtk gliches, but messaging is functionally usable.
* added Remoko -> PC remote controler via bluetooth, with gestures it's easy to look like one is performing black magic conjurations, I recommend to train gestures with more subtle moviments ;)
