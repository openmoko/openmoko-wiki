=== Description ===
A combination of apps(a lot of) and fixes to demonstrate the capabilities of the Freerunner and to have a functional phone (sort of). This all while retaining the ability to update through the official feeds. 

Until now, flashing the phone was the only way to update to the last release of FDOM but since 20081023 version there is a script called FDOMizer able to update to the lastest version of FDOM any older version of FDOM and is able to tranform a brand new flashed OM2008.X  on the phone to a full bloated FDOM

* Notes:
**If you have updated your kernel, re-flash back to the default Om2008.9 kernel so that your kernels and modules are the same version.  Otherwise none of the device drivers load and you have no usb0 or other essential stuff.

=== Development ===
I you want to come to the script kidding party :) join us at 

http://projects.openmoko.org/projects/fdom/

Serious developers are welcome too :) but remember  "if it's cool, it works(in some way),doesn't annoying(too much) rest of things and fits on the nand it's in" :) we will let scalability, stability, resource saving and so on to the OM guys :)

The devel list is:
http://lists.projects.openmoko.org/mailman/listinfo/fdom-development

Thanks to armin, we have also a svn server svn://zoup.org/Fdom with an
2008.09 that we want to transform in a better FDOM.

=== Warnings ===
* If after an opkg update/upgrade dialer, contacts and other qtopia-x11 apps don't work and qpe shows an error window you should check whether the startup file is executable, or revert changes.

The following adds permissions of '''r'''ead and e'''x'''ecution to the qtopia startup session file:
 # chmod a+rx /etc/X11/Xsession.d/89qtopia

The following reverts last change to the qtopia startup session file:
 # cp /etc/X11/Xsession.d/89qtopia.bk~ /etc/X11/Xsession.d/89qtopia

Now reboot the neo.

==== 15 Sep Updates ====
* It seems that there were major updates today that caused dialer to not work , It does happen when you click on dialer and it does exit with Enlightenment error , qucik fix to this is 

 # ln /opt/Qtopia/bin/qcop /usr/bin/qcop -s

but i believe adding /opt/Qtopia/bin to global system path is better solution (How?).


==== 20080927 and Pidgin ====
* I forget to install the following packages to enable ssl (needed by msn) and irc
install the following to make it work 
 opkg -force-depends install http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/feeds/2008/ipk/glibc/armv4t/base/libpurple-plugin-ssl_2.5.0-r0_armv4t.ipk

 opkg -force-depends install http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/feeds/2008/ipk/glibc/armv4t/base/libpurple-plugin-ssl-nss_2.5.0-r0_armv4t.ipk

 opkg -force-depends install http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/feeds/2008/ipk/glibc/armv4t/base/libpurple-plugin-ssl-gnutls_2.5.0-r0_armv4t.ipk

 opkg -force-depends install http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/feeds/2008/ipk/glibc/armv4t/base/libpurple-protocol-irc_2.5.0-r0_armv4t.ipk
