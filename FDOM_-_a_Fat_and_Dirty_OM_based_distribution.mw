=== Description ===
A combination of apps(a lot of) and fixes to demonstrate the capabilities of the Freerunner and to have a functional phone (sort of). This all while retaining the ability to update through the official feeds.

Until now, flashing the phone was the only way to update to the last release of FDOM but since 20081023 version there is a script called FDOMizer able to update to the lastest version of FDOM any older version of FDOM and is able to transform a brand new flashed OM2008.X  on the phone to a full bloated FDOM

* Notes:
**If you have updated your kernel, re-flash back to the default [http://downloads.openmoko.org/releases/Om2008.9/Om2008.9.uImage.bin| Om2008.9 kernel] so that your kernels and modules are the same version.  Otherwise none of the device drivers load and you have no usb0 or other essential stuff.
