=== Description ===
A combination of apps(a lot of) and fixes to demonstrate the capabilities of the Freerunner and to have a functional phone (sort of). This all while retaining the ability to update through the official feeds.

Until now, flashing the phone was the only way to update to the last release of FDOM but since 20081023 version there is a script called FDOMizer able to update to the lastest version of FDOM any older version of FDOM and is able to transform a brand new flashed OM2008.X  on the phone to a full bloated FDOM

Any questions can be sent to David-Reyes Samblas Martinez david at tuxbrain dot com or at community list or local-openmoko-spain list, see [[Development_resources#Mailing_Lists|mailing lists]]. Co admins are Armin ranjbar aka [http://zoup.org Zoup] and Nacho Seijo aka himero.

* Notes:
**If you have updated your kernel, re-flash back to the default [http://downloads.openmoko.org/releases/Om2008.9/ Om2008.9 kernel] so that your kernels and modules are the same version.  Otherwise none of the device drivers load and you have no usb0 or other essential stuff.

=== Development ===
If you want to come to the script kidding party :) join us at

http://projects.openmoko.org/projects/fdom/

Serious developers are welcome too :) but remember  "if it's cool, it works(in some way),doesn't annoying(too much) rest of things and fits on the nand it's in" :) we will let scalability, stability, resource saving and so on to the OM guys :)

The devel list is:

'''Complete overview of assembling FDOM distribution'''

Index: '-' means that all is OK, '?' means that it is unknown if it is OK or a customisation is needed. Note that launcher name is made as short as possible so it is not abbreviated in Illume. The icons are to be optimised to 80x80 (not smaller and also not bigger) because this will make a very sharp experience of OpenMoko. The up and down scaling of icons is not optimised compared to doing it beforehand with a tool like GIMP.
