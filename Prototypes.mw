Prototypes are pieces of hardware such as boards, fully assembled devices, batteries, accessories that OpenMoko uses during the development of new hardware.

This page tracks such prototypes, in which condition their life started, and what happened to them during their lifetime.

Prototypes cannot be purchased. They will be loaned out on a case by case basis, and collected back for post mortem analysis.

If you believe you need a prototype of some upcoming hardware, please mailto:openmoko-kernel@lists.openmoko.org.
