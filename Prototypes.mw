Prototypes are pieces of hardware such as boards, fully assembled devices, batteries, accessories that OpenMoko uses during the development of new hardware.

This page tracks such prototypes, in which condition their life started, and what happened to them during their lifetime.

Prototypes cannot be purchased. They will be loaned out on a case by case basis, and collected back for post mortem analysis.

If you believe you need a prototype of some upcoming hardware, please mailto:openmoko-kernel@lists.openmoko.org.

=== #3 GTA02 A5 ===
current holder: Andy<br>
02 Feb 2008 I see similar behaviour to #15 today on battery + USB.  Appears to be related to, eg, starting LCM backlight making power problems resulting in immediate shutdown.  Current limit issue somehow?<br>
01 Feb 2008 Behaving well.<br>
