In addition to the [[Expansion Back]] there could be an Expansion front, taking care of people calling for extra buttons. For example, the little hole that goes through the phone, could be filled up with an analog joystick.<br />
Even touch strips for scrolling could be realized.<br />
Please note that a new front ''without'' the hole automatically needs a back that also comes without the hole, thus cutting your possibilities for using an expansion back.
