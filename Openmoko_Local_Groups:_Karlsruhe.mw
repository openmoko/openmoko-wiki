It would be great to have a local user group also in Karlsruhe. According this list [[GroupSales#Karlsruhe]] many people of the beatyful city of Karlsruhe were interested in the Moko Project. We could meet informally at one of Karlsruhes many bars.

Just add your name to the list and we will see if there is any interest in a Karlsruhe User Group.
