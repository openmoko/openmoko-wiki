The practical way to install software on OpenMoko is with the [http://handhelds.org/moin/moin.cgi/Ipkg Ipkg package manager], possibly via the graphical [[Application Manager]]. Naturally, you need to have obtained an OpenMoko system by other means initially.

For the latest ipk package files from buildhost put the following lines in your /etc/ipkg/base-feed.conf:
 src/gz all http://buildhost.openmoko.org/tmp/deploy/ipk/all/
 src/gz armv4t http://buildhost.openmoko.org/tmp/deploy/ipk/armv4t/
 src/gz fic-gta01 http://buildhost.openmoko.org/tmp/deploy/ipk/fic-gta01/

In the shell, "ipkg update" will update the list of available packages, "ipkg upgrade" will download and install all packages that have a newer version available" and "ipkg install new-app" will download and install "new-app".

== History ==

Ipkg re-implements for embedded systems the Debian tools dpkg, apt, and apt-get. For example, it uses much less disk space for the package metadata.
