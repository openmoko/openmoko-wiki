The practical way to install software on OpenMoko is with the [http://handhelds.org/moin/moin.cgi/Ipkg Ipkg package manager], possibly via the graphical [[Application Manager]]. Naturally, you need to have obtained an OpenMoko system by other means initially.

In the shell, "ipkg install new-app" will download and install "new-app", "ipkg update" will update the list of available packages, and "ipkg upgrade" will download and install all packages that have a newer version available.

Precompiled ipk package files are available at least at:
* http://downloads.openmoko.org/tmp/neo1973/ipk/
* http://buildhost.openmoko.org/snapshots/2007.04/ipk/

== History ==

Ipkg re-implements for embedded systems the Debian tools dpkg, apt, and apt-get. For example, it uses much less disk space for the package metadata.
