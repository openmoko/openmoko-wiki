Legendary First Person Shooter. Rafa shared a simple duke nukem 3d port for Neo which can be played using the accelerometer :)

* opkg install http://alasal.be/openmoko/repo/duke3d_0.1.1_armv4t.ipk
* [http://onlinedev.blogspot.com/2008/09/getting-duke-nukem-3d-on-your-neo.html HOWTO] about the package.

Note: Game will not run if you don't have accelerometers working properly (check with 'hexdump /dev/input/event2' and 'hexdump /dev/input/event3'. Also make sure PulseAudio isn't running: '/etc/init.d/pulseaudio stop', otherwise it will cause the following error: some people have reported that it will not run resulting in the error 'Unknown multivoc error' even when PulseAudio is not installed - waiting on a workaround. To use game without sound, edit ~/.duke3d/duke3d.cfg and change FXDevice = 0 to FXDevice = 13 under [Sound Setup]
