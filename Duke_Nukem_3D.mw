Legendary First Person Shooter. Rafa shared a simple duke nukem 3d port for Neo which can be played using the accelerometer :)

* opkg install http://alasal.be/openmoko/repo/duke3d_0.1.1_armv4t.ipk

Note: Game will not run if you don't have accelerometers working properly (check with 'hexdump /dev/input/event2' and 'hexdump /dev/input/event3'. Also make sure PulseAudio isn't running: '/etc/init.d/pulseaudio stop', otherwise it will cause the following error: some people have reported that it will not run resulting in the error 'Unknown multivoc error' even when PulseAudio is not installed - waiting on a workaround. To use game without sound, edit ~/.duke3d/duke3d.cfg and change FXDevice = 0 to FXDevice = 13 under [Sound Setup]

[[User:Chgros|Charles-Henri]]'s version:
* http://charles-henri.org/duke3d_1.0-r1_armv4t.opk
* http://charles-henri.org/duke3d-source.tar.gz
* http://charles-henri.org/Xglamo

The buttons are:
 jump            escape
 prev weapon     next weapon
 open/accept     fire

In menus, click to the left to go back.
In y/n menus, click "open" to accept / "escape" to cancel.
Saving / loading should work; to save, select a slot, use jump, prev weapon or next weapon to add a dummy name, then press accept.

The Xglamo binary fixes [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1244 this bug].

Sergiomtz.losa and Lindi:
'''Don't use the wiki to ask!'''

Is the game data DFSG free?
Answer: The data with the game is the shareware demo level.

I got the following error: ERROR: Cannot satisfy the following dependencies for duke3d: libsdl-ttf
Where is that lib? I haven't found it.
Answer: ask at the proper openmoko.org mailing list

These answers will be deleted tomorrow. Use the community mailing list or opkg.org to ask.
