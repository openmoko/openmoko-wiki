Thank You for your efforts to Free The Phone


And on the back side, the following Lao Tze quote :

Thirty spokes share the wheels's hub<br />
It is the center hole that makes it useful<br />
Shape clay into a vessel<br />
It is the space whithin that makes it useful<br />
Cut doors and windows for a room<br />
It is the holes which make it useful<br />
Therefore benefit comes from what is there<br />
Usefulness from what is not there.

Lao Tze
