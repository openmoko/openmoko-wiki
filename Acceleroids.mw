Acceleroids - a port of SDLRoids (an Asteroids clone).
The ship movement is controlled by an accelerometer while the cannon, shield and bomb can be activated by touching bottom-right, bottom-left and top-right corners of the screen accordingly. 

Shield+Shoot buttons can be pressed simultaneously as well as Shield+Bomb (some sort of multi-touch simulation).

.deb package is also available at the project's home page.
