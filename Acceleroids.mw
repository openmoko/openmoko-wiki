Hello!

I'm glad to present you a new fully Freerunner-adapted game - Acceleroids -
a port of SDLRoids (an Asteroids clone).
The ship movement is controlled by an accelerometer while the cannon, shield
and bomb can be activated by touching bottom-right, bottom-left and
top-right corners of the screen accordingly. Shield+Shoot buttons
can be pressed simultaneously as well as Shield+Bomb (some sort of
multi-touch simulation).

The released packages are tested only by myself, so you are welcome to
report about missing dependencies  ;) .
Have Fun.
