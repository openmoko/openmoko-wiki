== The problem ==

If you do a phone interview the sound quality of interviewed will be limited by the sound quality of the phone. This can be improved by having a high quality recording done locally in both ends, followed by mixing the 2 high quality recordings. One of the problems by doing this is to synchronize the high quality recordings, so they start at the same time.

== The idea ==

Both the interviewer (here after Alice) and the interviewee (here after Bob) have a smartphone (or PC) that runs the Synchronized High Quality Recording program. 

When Alice starts the interview she presses a button. This sends a signal (e.g. DTMF tones) to Bob's phone and then both phones starts a high quality recording exactly at the same time (the signal works like a clacker when filming). Alice will hear Bob in the normal phone quality, but Bob's phone will record the high quality. 

When Alice ends the interview she presses a button. This sends a signal to Bob's phone to end the recording.

After the interview is done, Bob will have to send his recording to Alice. This can be done through the Internet.

The format of the recording could include the low quality audio from the other end. In a stero sound file the high quality recording would be in the left channel and the low quality in the right channel. This will make it easy to do the final mixing.

== Applications ==

Podcasters can use this to virtually have people in the studio.

It may be usable for keeping a record of a teleconference.

It may be usable for making a radio theater without needing to have the actors come in.
