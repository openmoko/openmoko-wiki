== GSM 850 Field Test Results ==

'''TEST HAS STARTED'''

As many of you are aware the GTA01's GSM 850 is non-functional at this time. This test was designed by many in the OpenMoko community (thanks to Michael Shiloh) to rectify the situation. A GTA01 was modified and will be shipped around North America and the results will be posted here.

**** GSM Area/Band: 850Mhz and 1900Mhz according to UNICEL, however, I am unable to register, find operators, or make calls in Qtopia release or OpenMoko MokoMakefile build from Jan 15 2008, so the SIM may be the culprit (these are not "3G SIMS" AFAIK). They work fine in the Nokia 5700 Quad Band. Trying to get my hands on a T-mobile SIM.

== The Script ==

This section is used for the script that should/may be shipped within the GTA01-Modified

'''please comment well'''

    #Section to start and record re-playable GPS data !!!Information available to limited people!!
   
    exec /home/root/gllin/gllin & 
    cat /home/root/gllin/nmeaNP > /media/card/nmeareplay &
   
    # End GPS section
   
    #Section to record GSM signal quality !!Do math for QOS statistics!!
    #This Feature will be used to record signal quality ONLY no grep'ing for GSM commands 
    
    #End Section


''Replaying the NMEA data can be done easily''
Just copy the nmeareplay file to your machine (/home/username/nmeareplay)
in your GPS software change the gps port to the nmeareplay file (/home/username/nmeareplay)

:When running, gllin creates a log file already, so nmeaNP doesn't need to be reflected to /home/root. Also, running for about two hours will fill the available memory.  We need to record the log files on flash if we want to run for more than a few minutes.  I do not know how to turn off the logging of the nmea0183 messages from gllin.  On my device, I linked /home/root/gllin/logs to a logs directory on my removable flash. --[[User:Sagacis|Sagacis]] 08:52, 12 January 2008 (CET)

:I think the logging should contain more information than just raw data.  Something like the following, perhaps. --[[User:Sagacis|Sagacis]] 08:54, 12 January 2008 (CET)
 LAT. LON, SIGNAL_STRENGTH, CARRIER NAME, TIME

== The Executable ==

I've created a native openmoko gui application to display the gsm and gps information and log to a file.

[[Image:Dashboard-1.png]]

gsmd only gives us operator name, signal strength and connection status.  We cannot currently get band or cell ID (to tell when switching towers).   Likewise, gpsd didn't give me what I needed, so the program watches /dev/nmeaNP instead.  You will need to launch gllin manually before running openmoko-dashboard.

Give it a shot and give me feedback.  Version 0.9 is available as [http://sagacis.doesntexist.com/openmoko-dashboard_0.9_src.tar.gz source tarball] and as [http://sagacis.doesntexist.com/openmoko-dashboard_0.9_armv4t.ipk ipk installer]. --[[User:Sagacis|Sagacis]] 01:13, 14 January 2008 (CET)
