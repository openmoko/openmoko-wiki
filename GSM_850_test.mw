== GSM 850 Field Test Results ==

'''TEST HAS STARTED (In PA)'''

As many of you are aware the GTA01's GSM 850 is non-functional at this time. This test was designed by many in the OpenMoko community (thanks to Michael Shiloh) to rectify the situation. A GTA01 was modified and is being shipped around North America and the results will be posted here as they are gathered.

== The Script ==

Was useless and I deleted it
See app below, its great
and now shows cell tower info
--KrisAbsinthe

== The Executable ==

I've created a native openmoko gui application to display the gsm and gps information and log to a file.

[[Image:Dashboard-1.png]]

gsmd only gives us operator name, signal strength and connection status.  We cannot currently get band, but the app now shows Cell ID so we might be able to tell when we switch towers.  gpsd didn't give me what I needed, so the program watches /dev/nmeaNP instead.  You will need to launch gllin manually.

Give it a shot and give me feedback.  Version 0.9 is available as [http://sagacis.doesntexist.com/projects/openmoko-dashboard_0.11_src.tar.gz source tarball] and as [http://sagacis.doesntexist.com/projects/openmoko-dashboard_0.11_armv4t.ipk ipk installer]. --[[User:Sagacis|Sagacis]] 06:52, 28 January 2008 (CET)
