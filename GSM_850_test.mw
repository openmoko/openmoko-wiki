== GSM 850 Field Test Results ==

As many of you are aware the GTA01's GSM 850 is non-funtional at this time. This test was designed by many in the OpenMoko community(thanks to Michael Shiloh). The GTA01 was modified and will be shipped around North America and the results will be posted here. A Map will be modified and hosted as I gain information. Dots in red are where the GTA01 will STOP; Green is where the GTA01 HAS stopped and moved on, Just like traffic lights.
