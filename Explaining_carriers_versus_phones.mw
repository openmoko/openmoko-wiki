This page is to develop an explanation to help people who are confused by the separation between carriers and phones, and the different technologies involved.

== The question ==

Some questions being asked:

* "Which service do we provide"
* "Which plan do I need"

== Carrier/phone separation ==

The [[Neo 1973]] is only a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone phone]. It's not tied to any specific [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_network_operator carrier], nor to any specific plans. If your carrier uses the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM GSM] technology, you can take any GSM phone which uses the same [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_frequencies frequencies] as your carrier and use it.

== Different technologies: CDMA versus GSM ==

There are several different technologies used in the cellular world. The two most important are known as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IS-95 CDMA] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM GSM]. These technologies are not compatible; a phone designed for one of them will ''not'' work on a cellular network which uses the other technology. Unless your carrier is one of the few who use both technologies, you must chose a phone with the same technology your carrier uses. You could also do the opposite&mdash;chose a carrier who uses the technology of the phone you have or intend to buy.

The [[Neo 1973]] works only on GSM networks.

== Technical details: cell phone frequencies ==

There are several different [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_frequencies radio frequency bands] allocated for cell phone use. Each carrier uses one or more of them; which frequency bands are available depends on the country the carrier is in. A phone will only work with a carrier if it can use the frequency bands the carrier uses. Most phones can use more than one frequency band; [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_band dual band], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tri_band tri band] or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quad_band quad band] phones are very common. A quad band phone will work with almost any GSM network in the world.

The [[Neo 1973]] is a quad-band GSM phone, so you do not have to worry about this.
