{{DistributionBox|
Name=Debian GNU/Linux |
Description=[[Debian]] is a universal operating system used on many embedded devices, servers and home computers. Using Debian on the FreeRunner gives access to the huge army of software packaged in the Debian repositories, already compiled for the Neo's ARM(v4) processor. Moreover, one can build one's own source files for programs without having to learn the OpenEmbedded way. For an existing Debian/Ubuntu user, choosing Debian for Neo FreeRunner makes phone a very familiar, trustworthy and flexible place to hack in.<br><br>
General news:
<br>
* Debian 6.0 was released!
* First (Openmoko specific) Linux 2.6.37 kernel is available. Highlights:
** Rebase on qtmoko-2.6.37-v35 branch of QtMoko (2.6.37.6 stable branch + openmoko patches)
** Add back a few wishlist configuration items not yet in QtMoko, including NFSv4, XATTR, CONFIG_OPENMOKO_RESUME_REASO
** Caveats: See [[Community_Updates/2011-02-01]]
* New E17 packages uploaded to Debian unstable
** Still work to do, not all packages updates with also prevents uploading a few Openmoko related packages like Zhone and Intone
** Call for help in E17 packaging posted at http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/04/msg00907.html
* Debian unstable is currently... unstable because of E17 transition, a touch screen driver change et cetera. Recommended Debian usage at the moment would be Debian 6.0 + only what you need from testing or unstable (like E17/Zhone).
* New xf86-video-glamo uploaded to work with new X.org
* omhacks 0.13 and 0.14 uploaded with new features and fixes
