== Running NetBSD on Neo1973 ==
The NetBSD/evbarm Neo1973 kernel is only ready for kernel developers. Still, it's derived from the longstanding SMDK2410 kernel, given the Neo1973 is [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/QT2410 Armzone QT2410], so SMDK2410, based.

=== Required tools ===
If you don't have a [[Neo1973]], you will need a [[OpenMoko under QEMU|Qemu Neo1973 emulator]], for instance the one running on top of [[Talk:OpenMoko under QEMU#Qemu_Neo1973_emulator_on_NetBSD|NetBSD]].

If you build the kernel yourself, you will need [[Talk:Bootloader|mkimage from u-boot]].

=== Building NetBSD ===

You'll need to download some kernel files.


In [[http://bugzilla.openmoko.org/cgi-bin/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=914 download-area]]

pick Attachment: "NetBSD/evbarm 3.1 NEO1973 syssrc 20071017"

(or "NetBSD/evbarm 4.0 NEO1973 kernel 20080413 (netboot)" for NetBSD 4.0)

Save Link As... syssrc-neo1973-20071017.tar.gz


and extract it over the NetBSD src tree:
 <pre>
tar xfz syssrc-neo1973-20071017.tar.gz -C /
 </pre>

From the NetBSD src tree run:
 <code>
 cd /usr/src
 ./build.sh -m evbarm tools
 ./build.sh -u -m evbarm kernel=NEO1973
 mkimage -A arm -O netbsd -T kernel -C none -a 30008000 -e 30008110 -n "Kernel Image" -d /usr/obj/sys/arch/evbarm/compile/NEO1973/netbsd  /usr/obj/sys/arch/evbarm/compile/NEO1973/netbsd.boot
 </code>

You'll now have a copy of the NetBSD kernel, called netbsd.boot, that's able to be loaded by u-boot.

=== Prebuild NetBSD ===
You'll need to download a kernel.


In [[http://bugzilla.openmoko.org/cgi-bin/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=914 download-area]]

pick Attachment: "NetBSD/evbarm 3.1 NEO1973 kernel 20071017 (netboot)"

Save Link As... netbsd-NEO1973-20071017.gz


extract and move this kernel into place:
 <pre>
gzip -d netbsd-NEO1973-20071017.gz
mkdir -f /usr/obj/sys/arch/evbarm/compile/NEO1973
mv netbsd-NEO1973-20071017 /usr/obj/sys/arch/evbarm/compile/NEO1973/netbsd.boot
 </pre>

=== Running NetBSD on the Neo ===

First, please note that NetBSD isn't actually known to work on the Neo, so your mileage here may vary quite a bit.   Having said that, if you want to try to boot NetBSD, it's pretty easy.

First, NetBSD requires a larger kernel partition than Linux.   I think this is because NetBSD is a statically-linked kernel, whereas Linux pulls modules out of the jffs partition, but that's just a theory.   Also, NetBSD will tend to come with a ramdisk, which is part of the kernel image.

Anyway, to rearrange the partitions, you will need to get into the u-boot console.   How you do this varies depending on the operating system you are running.   On NetBSD, you're going to type something like:

<pre>
uma% screen /dev/tty.usbmodem00000001
</pre>
If you see a prompt like this, you're in business:
<pre>GTA01Bv4 #
</pre>

You can dump the current partition table like this:

<pre>GTA01Bv4 # mtdparts
</pre>

This will print a list of partitions and some other information; it might be a good idea to make a copy if you want to install Linux later and don't want to keep the larger kernel partition size.

To change the partition table, you're going to have to delete all the partitions from the kernel onward, and then re-add them.   When you do this, beware: you're going to wipe out the nice boot splash screen.   It has its own partition, which you are going to move.   So after you've made this change, you're going to see a dead black splash screen when the phone boots, which you may find alarming.   Don't say you weren't warned.   Also, please read the full instructions here before proceeding - don't just blindly start typing now.

Okay, you've gathered your courage and are ready to go for it.   Here are the commands you need, first to delete the partitions:
<pre>
GTA01Bv4 # mtdparts del kernel
GTA01Bv4 # mtdparts del splash
GTA01Bv4 # mtdparts del rootfs
</pre>

and then to add the new ones:

<pre>
GTA01Bv4 # mtdparts add nand0 0x300000 kernel
GTA01Bv4 # mtdparts add nand0 0x0a0000 splash
GTA01Bv4 # mtdparts add nand0 0x3a1c000 rootfs
</pre>

As far as I can tell there's no way to get mtdparts to say "use the rest of the flash memory for this partition."   Sorry about that.   So you just have to do the math.   Also, the amount of space a partition consumes changes if there are bad blocks in it.   So you may have to fiddle around with the size of the rootfs partition.   You can check to see how the partition table came out like this:

<pre>
GTA01Bv4 # mtdparts

device nand0 <neo1973-nand>, # parts = 5
 #: name                        size            offset          mask_flags
 0: u-boot              0x00040000      0x00000000      0
 1: u-boot_env          0x00004000      0x00040000      0
 2: kernel              0x00214000      0x00044000      0
 3: splash              0x000a0000      0x00258000      0
 4: rootfs              0x03a1c000      0x002f8000      0

active partition: nand0,0 - (u-boot) 0x00040000 @ 0x00000000

defaults:
mtdids  : nand0=neo1973-nand
mtdparts: <NULL>

</pre>

Now, you haven't actually changed anything yet - if you power cycle the phone at this point, the partition table will go back to the way it was.   To make it permanent, you have to save it to flash:

<pre>
GTA01Bv4 # saveenv
</pre>

This is obvious, but I'll say it anyway: don't delete the u-boot or u-boot_env partitions.   If you do, you'll probably brick your phone.   Heck, you'll probably brick your phone anyway.   I told you you needed to be brave, didn't I?

Now, to install the kernel, assuming that you've survived all of these steps, you can use dfu-util:
<pre>
uma% dfu-util -a kernel -R -D ~/Desktop/netbsd.boot
</pre>

=== Running NetBSD under Qemu ===

From the qemu directory edit openmoko/flash.sh and add the line:
 <code>
 kernel_image="/usr/obj/sys/arch/evbarm/compile/NEO1973/netbsd.boot"
 </code>
after the four "most_recent" lines.

(if you do use [[Talk:OpenMoko under QEMU#Qemu_Neo1973_emulator_on_NetBSD|wip/qemu-neo1973]], the line is allready there..and you should only have to uncomment the line.)


Next run
 <code>
 ./openmoko/download.sh
 ./openmoko/flash.sh
 </code>

This will fetch the required parts and create an image to run. They require you to have bash installed.

Finally run qemu with
 <code>
 cd /usr/pkg/qemu-neo1973; qemu-neo1973 -M neo -m 130 -mtdblock openmoko/openmoko-flash.image -kernel openmoko/openmoko-kernel.bin -usb -show-cursor -serial telnet:localhost:1200,server
 </code>

And from another xterm
 <code>
 telnet localhost 1200
 </code>
and qemu will go on with the startup process.


In Qemu running u-boot,

press Space to select option "Boot".

In telnet to the serial port you should see:
<pre>
host007# telnet localhost 1200
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.

Here's a [[:Image:Netbsd-evbarm-neo1973.png|screenshot]].

I made small progress and now have ramdisk, usb device from qemu and draw_test_pattern to lcd. Here's the [[:Image:Netbsd-evbarm-neo1973-lcd.png|screenshot]].

Progress again, active in a nfs boot.
[[:Image:Netbsd-evbarm-neo1973-nfs_boot.png|screenshot]].

We have netboot and uname -a.
