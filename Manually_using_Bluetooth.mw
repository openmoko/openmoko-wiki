At the moment, we've just started to introduce Bluetooth into our [[Neo1973 Hardware]].

We have quite a lot of plans about what exactly Bluetooth should be used for.

== Bluetooth Functions ==

=== HID (Human Input Device) ===

==== Being able to use HID devices ====

We want to be able to use a bluetooth keyboard to type into the various applications of our Neo1973.


==== Acting as HID device ====

We want to be able to use the Neo1973 as a HID device, being able to use it as controller for presentations.

=== OBEX ===

=== Networking ===

Bluetooth should behave just like our usbnet and provide full TCP/IP access to the phone.  BNEP has to be used.

=== A2DP ===
