At the moment, we've just started to introduce Bluetooth into our [[:Category:Neo1973 Hardware | Neo1973 Hardware]].

We have quite a lot of plans about what exactly Bluetooth should be used for.

== Power it up ==

Bluetooth may not be powered up. The steps below work for most people but at least one P0 phone is very stubborn about powering up bluetooth and usually doesn't.

Load the usb bluetooth driver:

 root@fic-gta01:~$ modprobe hci_usb

Reset and power up the adapter

 root@fic-gta01:~$ echo "1" > /sys/bus/platform/devices/gta01-pm-bt.0/power_on 
 root@fic-gta01:~$ echo "1" > /sys/bus/platform/devices/gta01-pm-bt.0/power_on 
 root@fic-gta01:~$ echo "1" > /sys/bus/platform/devices/gta01-pm-bt.0/reset 

Check to see if the adapter is up and running:

 hciconfig

(If you have an older rootfs, you may need to modprobe gta01-pm-bt but it's built in currently.)

== Bluetooth Functions ==

=== HID (Human Input Device) ===

==== Being able to use HID devices ====

We want to be able to use a bluetooth keyboard to type into the various applications of our Neo1973.


==== Acting as HID device ====

We want to be able to use the Neo1973 as a HID device, being able to use it as controller for presentations.

=== OBEX ===

=== Networking ===

Bluetooth should behave just like our usbnet and provide full TCP/IP access to the phone.  BNEP has to be used.

On the laptop:
* Start bluetooth
 elara /home/alphaone # /etc/init.d/bluetooth start

* Start pand as server
 elara /home/alphaone # pand -s

* As soon as pand is started on the phone configure your IP address
 elara /home/alphaone # ip a add 10.0.0.1/24 dev bnep0
 elara /home/alphaone # ip l set bnep0 up

* Configure IP forwarding and masquerading to your liking

On the phone:

* Power on bluetooth (see above)

* Scan for the laptop
 root@fic-gta01:~$ hcitool scan

* Connect to the laptop pand
 root@fic-gta01:~$ pand -c 00:20:E0:5A:FE:C8

* Configure your IP address
 ip a add 10.0.0.2/24 dev bnep0
 ip r add default via 10.0.0.1

* Enjoy

=== A2DP ===

The A2DP codec, SBC, runs pretty well now in 32-bit fixed-point math. It's been successfully tested on a faster ARM but not yet on neo. There is test code in the bluetooth-alsa.sf.net plugz module for using alsa plugins to send A2DP audio out and it's starting to be reimplemented "properly" in the bluez core.

=== Headset Audio ===

Bluez has an audio daemon for headset audio that should work to set up the control connection to the headset. It will need hooks in the openmoko gui.

Hopefully FIC can provide more detail about what magic needs to happen with the Wolfson codec so system audio can be switched to use the bluetooth audio channel and later back to the speaker/earpiece/wired headset.
