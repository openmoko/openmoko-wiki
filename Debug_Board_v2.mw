== Overview ==

The [[Debug Board | debug board]] provides these key components.

* [[Debug Board#USB Hub | USB Hub]]
* [[Debug Board#JTAG using FT2232 | JTAG using FT2232]]
* [[Debug Board#Serial Port | Serial Port]]

=== USB Hub ===

This bus-powered hub 
* attaches to the laptop using its upstream port
* attaches to the FT2232D for JTAG and serial console on downstream port 1
* attaches to a free USB-A connector using downstream port 2
* attaches to the phone using downstream port 3

Using the hub, you can have access to the phone, JTAG and serial simultaneously, through a single USB cable.

You can actually even charge the phone (100mA slow charge) using that downstream port.

For the ISB hub function, we use the TUSB2046B chip.

=== JTAG using FT2232 ===

Basically, we integrate a USB-JTAG adaptor similar to the [Amontec JTAGkey-tiny].  The actual reference design that we used (Thanks to Joern!) can be found at http://www.oocdlink.com

This provides us full JTAG debugging, at about 150times the speed of the [[wiggler]]

The actual JTAG port is connected with
* the phone (via debug flex cable)
* A separate 20-pin header using standard ARM-JTAG pinout
** this allows the user to use this device as JTAG adaptor even for other arm-based devices

=== Serial Port ===

Instead of replicating a true RS232 port, we wanted to use a USB serial converter chip,
such as the FT232 or the PL2303.   

As it turns out, we can even use the second port of the FT2232 simultaneously with the JTAG.  So no extra FT232 or PL2303 is required.

==== Tri-State Serial Port ====

The serial port needs a tri-state driver, since it is both connected to the GSM modem AND to the debug board.  We drive the tri-state driver by an inverted GSM_EN signal (pin 7 on FPC connector).

== Usage Instructions ==

=== Preconditions ===

==== FT2232D EEPROM ====

Your Debug Board contains a small serial EEPROM which should be flashed correctly during production.  However, some boards have received incorrect/incomplete programming during production and thus you should verify this.

If the board shows up as USB ID 1457:5118, then everything is correct.

Only if your board shows up as USB ID 0403:6010, then you will need to flash the board!

===== Flashing with Linux =====

{{note|FIC has done that for you, in case you have officially been supplied with the board.  However, if you are one of the early adopters, the configuration and USB vendorID / productID might have not yet been set correctly.}}

In order to do so, you can use the ftdi_eeprom program from 
http://www.intra2net.com/de/produkte/opensource/ftdi/. Unfortunately, the latest version (0.2) doesn't yet contain support for our FT2232D, so you need the patch from http://people.openmoko.org/laforge/misc/debug_board_v2/ftdi_eeprom/ftdi_eeprom-0.2-moko.patch

You may also need to apply the following patch to libftdi:
http://people.openmoko.org/werner/libftdi-c56-strings-dirty-hack.patch
(See http://bugzilla.openmoko.org/cgi-bin/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=321 for additional details.)

Furthermore, you will need the EEPROM config:
http://people.openmoko.org/laforge/misc/debug_board_v2/ftdi_eeprom/neo1973_debug_board_v2.ftdi

Once you have compiled ftdi_eeprom, you can run
 ftdi_eeprom --flash-eeprom neo1973_debug_board_v2.ftdi

{{warning|Make sure you don't have any other FTDI FT232 / FT2232 based devices attached to the USB while running ftdi_eeprom.  It might be wise to disconnect everything but the debug board}}

You should get something like the following printout if everything was successful:
<pre>
FTDI eeprom generator v0.2
(c) Intra2net AG <opensource@intra2net.com>
FTDI init: 0
Unable to find FTDI devices under given vendor/product id: 0x1457/0x5118
Retrying with default FTDI id.
Used eeprom space: 102 bytes
FTDI write eeprom: 0
Writing to file: neo1973_debug_board_v2.eeprom
FTDI close: 0
</pre>

Once the flashing has finished, just disconnect and reconnect, and you should see
<pre>

===== Flashing with Windows =====
{{note|FIC has done that for you, in case you have officially been supplied with the board.  However, if you are one of the early adopters, the configuration and USB vendorID / productID might have not yet been set correctly.}}

In order to do so, you can use the FTDI Mprog program from http://www.ftdichip.com/Resources/Utilities/MProg3.0_Setup.exe
 
You will need
* The EEPROM Template http://people.openmoko.org/laforge/misc/debug_board_v2/mprog_template/neo1973_debugboard_v2.ept

==== Drivers ====

===== Linux =====

Please make sure you have libftdi-0.8 or later.  Earlier versions are known to cause problems

Furthermore, you will need to do the following:

====== ftdi_sio module option ======

 rmmod ftdi_sio
 modprobe ftdi_sio vendor=0x1457 product=0x5118

or the equivalent in your modules.conf

====== udev rule ======

Please install the rules from http://people.openmoko.org/laforge/misc/debug_board_v2/udev_rules/

===== Windows =====

Please use the driver from http://people.openmoko.org/laforge/misc/debug_board_v2/windows_drivers/

=== Hardware connection ===

* [[Connecting Neo1973 with Debug Board v2]]

=== Actually using it ===

==== On Linux ====

===== Serial Port =====

The Linux kernel of your host system will create a virtual serial device called '''/dev/ttyUSBx''' where 'x' is a sequentially assigned number.  If you don't have any other USB serial converters attached to your machine, the device name will be '''/dev/ttyUSB0'''.

You can use your favourite terminal emualtor (minicom, cu, zc, ...) just like for any other/real serial port.

===== JTAG =====

Once you have installed libftdi >= 0.8 and configured [[OpenOCD]] with the correct openocd.cfg from [[OpenOCD#openocd.cfg]], it should work just fine.

Please see [[OpenOCD#OpenOCD_and_Debug_Board]] for some more information.

== History ==

We previously had [[Debug Board v1]]

=== Changes from v1 to v2 ===

* get rid of ethernet
** we don't need it, and
** we especially don't want a 40pin parallel 66MHz bus going between two pcb's
* get rid of 7-segment LED displays
** not really needed.  We have a serial port
** could be replaced by one or two GPIO LED's
* get rid of built-in [[wiggler]]
** nobody has a parallel port on the laptop these days
* get rid of li-ion battery (including charger)
** the device can be fully usb powered by the laptop
