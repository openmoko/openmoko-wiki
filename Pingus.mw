Currently working on (2008-11-11)

* '''bitbake recipe for [http://pingus.seul.org Pingus]'''
** current state: working
** caveats:
*** sound needs aoss wrapper, and is choppy. better leave disabled
*** run in landscape mode! (this is now done automatically)
*** pingus 0.7.2 has a known memory leak
*** you need to manually install libpng3, since I didn't manage to get the right dependency on the pingus package
** submitted patches and recipe to OpenEmbedded [http://bugs.openembedded.net/show_bug.cgi?id=4711 bug #4711] (requires [http://bugs.openembedded.net/show_bug.cgi?id=4710 bug #4710]) but you can take the patches and recipies and apply these to the openmoko repository (or just wait 'till they get merged).
