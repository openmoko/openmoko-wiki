==Distributions==
* FSO- Freesmartphone.org team is proud to present the fifth milestone release codenamed 'Calling All Stations'. If you like to know more details read them here:

::http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/OpenmokoFramework/Status_Update_6. You can grab it on http://downloads.freesmartphone.org/fso-stable/milestone5/ . 
:: Have fun and happy hacking.

He will be in charge of integration for buildhost server and downloads server, images management and integration for the software team.  Feel free to contact him, if you have any questions about images.

==New Applications ==
* [[CellHunter]]-Cellhunter is a game with the goal to find as much unknown mobile cells as you can and submit them. You are playing in groups against other groups and collect the information together. Depending on the type of the collected cell you get points. New cells count more points than already known cells. More information at http://cellhunter.omoco.de

* [[Vala-terminal]]-Command Line Terminal. It is written in (vala) programming-language. Vala produces c-code, which is then compiled in binary form, so vala does not add any runtime requirements/dependencies. This is an official successor to openmoko-terminal2 (https://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/openmoko-community/2008/11/13/4084004/thread).

* [[GTick]]-GTick is a metronome application written for GNU/Linux and other UN*X-like operating systems supporting different meters (Even, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4 and more) and speeds ranging from 10 to 1000 bpm. It utilizes GTK+ and OSS (ALSA compatible). It is part of the GNU Project. This program has been originally written by Alex Roberts, but since he didn't have the time to develop and maintain it further, I (Roland Stigge) took it over (initially to package it for Debian, but there were too many "upstream" issues, so I decided to maintain the whole package). Since then, the program has been mainly rewritten (new DSP core, GTK+2 port, added features).

* [[Nethack]]-NetHack is a single player dungeon exploration game that runs on a wide variety of computer systems, with a variety of graphical and text interfaces all using the same game engine. Unlike many other Dungeons & Dragons-inspired games, the emphasis in NetHack is on discovering the detail of the dungeon and not simply killing everything in sight - in fact, killing everything in sight is a good way to die quickly. Each game presents a different landscape - the random number generator provides an essentially unlimited number of variations of the dungeon and its denizens to be discovered by the player in one of a number of characters: you can pick your race, your role, and your gender.
