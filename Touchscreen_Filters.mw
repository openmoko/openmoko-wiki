Work in progress.

'''TODO:''' Complete the document.
'''TODO:''' Improve videos (with no music, please).

In this document we describe the algorithms we use to make
the touchscreen behave well. By "well" we mean that we can:

* Get reliable clicks with the stylus and with the finger
* Avoid further filtering in user space
* Avoid calibration in user-space. We believe X (and other programs) should be able to gather reliable data from /dev/input/eventX.

Openmoko developers and contributors have tried different approaches
that have helped improve the touchscreen performance. As a result now
we have a touchscreen filtering framework that we are using in Linux
2.6. We describe the current working solution as of December 2008 as
it is in the [http://git.openmoko.org/?p=kernel.git;a=shortlog;h=andy-tracking andy-tracking] branch of the Openmoko GIT repository.

If you think we can improve something please [http://lists.openmoko.org/mailman/listinfo/openmoko-kernel send us feedback].

We include videos showing how things improve as we add filters. In the
videos we use a program that plots the points reported by the driver[3].
