This page lists various images you can try out on your Openmoko supported smartphone and some other downloads. Note however, that some of these are works in progress and may not have even released any files yet. Nothing is guaranteed to work. Proceed at your own risk.

Unofficial users repositories can be found [[Users Repositories|here]]

== Distributions and installation ==

See [[Distributions]] for description of the images downloadable here.

See [[Flashing the Neo FreeRunner]] for installation instructions. Neo 1973 users: [[Getting Started with your Neo1973]]. 

In most cases you will download a Root FileSystem and a Kernel to flash into your phone. If you cannot find a kernel in the directory where you download the Root FS, please pick a kernel from an older directory. The third available file is the bootloader, probably don't want to install a new version of that unless there are bug fixes you really need.

If you want to install a system to a microSD card, see [[Booting from SD]].

=== Om 2008.8 images (ASU) ===
[[Image:Images.png|center]]
These images are based on the branch ''org.openmoko.asu.stable''. They are the ASU distribution. Sorry, there are no build for the Neo 1973 yet, only the FreeRunner. While the branch name ends with ''.stable'', repositories are updated daily. In an ideal world there would never be any regressions and the quality of builds would improve every day. We are not in an ideal world.
The content of these images is presented at: {{Main|Om 2008.8}}

There are two sources, depending on whether you are an end user or a developer. In both cases, the files you want are of the form:
:Om2008.8-gta02-YYYYMMDD.rootfs.jffs2 (root file system)
:Om2008.8-gta02-YYYYMMDD.uImage.bin (kernel image)

====End user====
If you want to install stable software, and only get stable updates,  
the latest stable image (will overwrite all data on your phone) can be  
found at:
:http://downloads.openmoko.org/releases/Om2008.8-update/
If you update packages in this image, they will come from the stable  
repository (updated daily from Holger's stable branch) at:
:http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/Om2008.8/
Holger (zecke) will continue to cherry-pick bug fixes with the right  
risk/reward ratio into his stable branch.

====Developer====
If you want bleeding edge, we have created an image that only contains Settings application and Installer, nothing else. We call it 'base  
image'. You can find this base image, updated daily, at:
:http://downloads.openmoko.org/daily/
By default, this image will fetch updates packages from our 'testing'  
repository:
:http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/testing/
If you want even more fun, change the package repository to  
'unstable', which will then fetch updates from:
:http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/unstable/

Once you have this base image, you can install the GTK+ telephony apps  
including gsmd, or Qtopia, or Mickey's framework.
Check out the [[FDOM]] page for an idea of what to install.

====First Om 2008.8 release (historical)====
The first Om 2008.8 release was made on 8/8/08 and is still available for historical purposes at:
:http://downloads.openmoko.org/releases/Om2008.8/
The files you want are:
: Om2008.8-gta02-20080808.rootfs.jffs2 
:  Om2008.8-gta02-20080808.uImage.bin
This image fetches updated packages from:
:http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/Om2008.8/om-gta02/

=== The bleeding edge: Om "base / empty" images ===

The ''org.openmoko.dev'' branch does not have any applications preinstalled other than settings and installer, and it is unstable for now.

Images for ''testing'' are at:
http://downloads.openmoko.org/daily/

To get packages from ''testing'', use this ''/etc/opkg/testing.conf'' :
<pre>
src/gz testing-all http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/testing/all
src/gz testing-arm http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/testing/armv4t
src/gz testing-i686 http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/testing/i686
src/gz testing-neo http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/testing/neo1973
src/gz testing-gta02 http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/testing/om-gta02
</pre>

''unstable'' comes from the same branch, compiled with the AUTOREV flag. There are no images, but packages are at http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/unstable/

Reference: See [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-August/027997.html "Repository and Images" announcement] for details on other "Base image", "testing" and "unstable".
