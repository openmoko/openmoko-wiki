This page lists various images you can try out on your Openmoko supported smartphone and some other downloads. Note however, that some of these are works in progress and may not have even released any files yet. Nothing is guaranteed to work. Proceed at your own risk.

If you are looking for a specific application, see {{Main|CommunityRepository}} or go directly to
* http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/Multiverse/
* Unofficial users repositories can be found [[Users Repositories|here]]

As of October 1st, 2008:
* The phones ship with [[Om 2007.2]]. It is not supported by Openmoko Inc. anymore. But community developpers continue to work on it as the [[SHR]] project.
* The FreeRunner is a reference platform for TrollTech's Qt Extended (formerly [[Qtopia]]) distribution.
* The stable branch is [[Om 2008.9]] (ASU), it is officially supported by Openmoko Inc. And based on that, the community made the [[FDOM]] distribution by adding lots of fixes and applications to it.
* The trunk tip is [[FSO]], the next release will be based on that. The [[Debian]] packaging team also track that.
* The big G did not make any announcement about an Android port.
See [[Distributions]] for more description and comparison of the images downloadable here. Then see [[Development Branches Policy]] when you want to know where the really bleeding edge is.

== Installation instructions ==

See [[Flashing the Neo FreeRunner]] for installation instructions. Neo 1973 users: [[Getting Started with your Neo1973]]. 

In most cases you will download 

* a Root FileSystem image and 
* a Kernel image 

to flash into your phone. The third available file is the u-Boot bootloader. This is a critical component, you don't want to install a new version of that unless there are bug fixes that you really need.

If you want to install a system to a microSD card, see [[Booting from SD]].

==Om 2008.9 (ASU)==

Om 2008.9 is an updated release of Om 2008.8. Flashing this image is equal to upgrading Om 2008.8 to September 16th with okpg. If you upgrade on any of the two systems, that ends up in exactly the same system [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-September/031003.html].

{{Main|Om2008.9 Update}}

'''Neo FreeRunner images'''

http://downloads.openmoko.org/releases/Om2008.9/

Note, that this is a certain "point release" of Om 2008.8. Updated images under the 2008.8 section are newer, because those are updated builds of the same distribution.

For older releases of this distribution, see [[Old Openmoko Distribution Releases]]

== The bleeding edge: Om "base / empty" images ==

The ''org.openmoko.dev'' branch does not have any applications preinstalled other than settings and installer, and it is unstable for now.

Images for ''testing'' are at:
http://downloads.openmoko.org/daily/

To get packages from ''testing'', use this ''/etc/opkg/testing.conf'' :
<pre>
src/gz testing-all http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/testing/all
src/gz testing-arm http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/testing/armv4t
src/gz testing-i686 http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/testing/i686
src/gz testing-neo http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/testing/neo1973
src/gz testing-gta02 http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/testing/om-gta02
</pre>

''unstable'' comes from the same branch, compiled with the AUTOREV flag. There are no images, but packages are at http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/unstable/

Reference: See [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-August/027997.html "Repository and Images" announcement] for details on other "Base image", "testing" and "unstable".

Once you have this base image, you can install the GTK+ telephony apps including gsmd, or Qtopia, or Mickey's framework. Check out the [[FDOM]] page for an idea of what to install.

== Om 2007.2 images (GTK) ==

{{Main|Om 2007.2}}
