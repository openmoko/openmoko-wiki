This page lists various images you can try out on your Openmoko supported smartphone and some other downloads. Note however, that some of these are works in progress and may not have even released any files yet. Nothing is guaranteed to work. Proceed at your own risk.

Unofficial users repositories can be found [[Users Repositories|here]]

== Distributions and installation ==

See [[Distributions]] for description and comparison of the images downloadable here.

See [[Flashing the Neo FreeRunner]] for installation instructions. Neo 1973 users: [[Getting Started with your Neo1973]]. 

In most cases you will download 

* a Root FileSystem image and 
* a Kernel image 

to flash into your phone. The third available file is the u-Boot bootloader, probably you don't want to install a new version of that unless there are bug fixes that you really need.

If you want to install a system to a microSD card, see [[Booting from SD]].

=== Understanding Om distribution releases ===

[[Image:Images.png|center|700px]]

==Om 2008.9==

Om 2008.9 is an updated release of Om 2008.8, Check [[Om2008.9 Update]] for more details. Flashing this image is equal to upgrading Om 2008.8 to a certain date by okpg. If you upgrade on any of the two systems, that ends up in exactly the same system [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-September/031003.html].

'''Neo FreeRunner images'''

http://downloads.openmoko.org/releases/Om2008.9/

Note, that this is a certain "point release" of Om 2008.8. Updated images under the 2008.8 section are newer, because those are updated builds of the same distribution.

==Om 2008.8 images (ASU)==

These images are based on the branch ''org.openmoko.asu.stable''. Sorry, there are no build for the Neo 1973 yet, only the FreeRunner. While the branch name ends with ''.stable'', repositories are updated daily. In an ideal world there would never be any regressions and the quality of builds would improve every day. We are not in an ideal world.

{{Main|Om 2008.8}}

'''Neo FreeRunner images'''

If you want to install stable software, and only get stable updates, the latest stable image (will overwrite all data on your phone) can be found at:

:http://downloads.openmoko.org/releases/Om2008.8-update/

:Root FileSystem files are named like: Om2008.8-gta02-YYYYMMDD.rootfs.jffs2
:Kernel files: Om2008.8-gta02-YYYYMMDD.uImage.bin

If you update packages in this image, they will come from the stable repository (updated daily from Holger's stable branch) at:

:http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/Om2008.8/

Holger (zecke) will continue to cherry-pick bug fixes with the right risk/reward ratio into his stable branch.

===First Om 2008.8 release (historical)===

The first Om 2008.8 release was made on 8/8/08 and is still available for historical purposes at http://downloads.openmoko.org/releases/Om2008.8/, this image fetches updated packages from :http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/Om2008.8/om-gta02/ .

== The bleeding edge: Om "base / empty" images ==

The ''org.openmoko.dev'' branch does not have any applications preinstalled other than settings and installer, and it is unstable for now.

Images for ''testing'' are at:
http://downloads.openmoko.org/daily/

To get packages from ''testing'', use this ''/etc/opkg/testing.conf'' :
<pre>
src/gz testing-all http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/testing/all
src/gz testing-arm http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/testing/armv4t
src/gz testing-i686 http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/testing/i686
src/gz testing-neo http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/testing/neo1973
src/gz testing-gta02 http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/testing/om-gta02
</pre>

''unstable'' comes from the same branch, compiled with the AUTOREV flag. There are no images, but packages are at http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/unstable/

Reference: See [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-August/027997.html "Repository and Images" announcement] for details on other "Base image", "testing" and "unstable".

Once you have this base image, you can install the GTK+ telephony apps including gsmd, or Qtopia, or Mickey's framework. Check out the [[FDOM]] page for an idea of what to install.
