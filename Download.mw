{{Main|Om 2008.12 Update}}

'''Neo FreeRunner images'''

There is no need to reflash if you have installed Om 2008.8 and used ''opkg update && opkg upgrade''. 

=== The bleeding edge: Om "base / empty" images ===

The ''org.openmoko.dev'' branch does not have any applications preinstalled other than settings and installer, and it is unstable for now.

Images for ''testing'' are at:
http://downloads.openmoko.org/distro/unstable/
To get packages from ''testing'', use this ''/etc/opkg/testing.conf'' :
<pre>
src/gz testing-all http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/testing/all
src/gz testing-arm http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/testing/armv4t
src/gz testing-neo http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/testing/neo1973
src/gz testing-gta02 http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/testing/om-gta02
</pre>
<!-- unused: src/gz testing-i686 http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/testing/i686 -->

''unstable'' comes from the same branch, compiled with the AUTOREV flag. There are no images, but packages are at http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/unstable/

Reference: See [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-August/027997.html "Repository and Images" announcement] for details on other "Base image", "testing" and "unstable".

Once you have this base image, you can install the GTK+ telephony apps including gsmd, or Qtopia, or Mickey's framework. Check out the [[FDOM]] page for an idea of what to install.

=== SHR images (Stable Hybrid Release) ===
{{Main|SHR}}
{{Main|SHR User Manual}}

The Stable Hybrid Release (SHR) is intended to be a community driven distribution composed of the FSO and some basic applications, that can be configured to use several different graphical toolkits, for example GTK or EFL. SHR is based on the FSO build. At first, SHR was introduced in order to use the Openmoko2007.2 GTK software in combination with the new FSO, but things have changed.
