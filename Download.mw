This page lists various images you can try out on your Openmoko supported smartphone and some [[#Other downloads]].

See [[Distributions]] for a more descriptive comparison. Then see [[Development Branches Policy]] when you want to know where the really bleeding edge is.

== Installation instructions ==

See [[Flashing the Neo FreeRunner]] for installation instructions. Neo 1973 users: [[Getting Started with your Neo1973]]. If you want to install a system to a microSD card, see [[Booting from SD]].

The release directories can contain up to four files:

* a Root FileSystem image. These are the files with '''rootfs''' in their name. They come both as a .jffs2 ready-to-flash image, and as a .tar.gz ready-to-cp tarball.
* a Kernel image (files with '''uimage''' in their name).
* a u-boot bootloader (file with '''u-boot''' in the name).
* a splash image file.

Also, the archive directory contains two identical versions of most files, one having the date in the filename. For those convenience ?

One usually needs only to flash the phone with the root filesystem and the kernel image. The splash image is eyecandy. The u-Boot bootloader is a critical component, you don't want to install a new version of that systematically, but there have been improvements since the one released in shipping phones.

=== The bleeding edge: Om "base / empty" images ===

The ''org.openmoko.dev'' branch does not have any applications preinstalled other than settings and installer, and it is unstable for now.

Images for ''testing'' are at:
http://downloads.openmoko.org/daily/

To get packages from ''testing'', use this ''/etc/opkg/testing.conf'' :
<pre>
src/gz testing-all http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/testing/all
src/gz testing-arm http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/testing/armv4t
src/gz testing-neo http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/testing/neo1973
src/gz testing-gta02 http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/testing/om-gta02
</pre>
<!-- unused: src/gz testing-i686 http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/testing/i686 -->

''unstable'' comes from the same branch, compiled with the AUTOREV flag. There are no images, but packages are at http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/unstable/

Reference: See [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-August/027997.html "Repository and Images" announcement] for details on other "Base image", "testing" and "unstable".

Once you have this base image, you can install the GTK+ telephony apps including gsmd, or Qtopia, or Mickey's framework. Check out the [[FDOM]] page for an idea of what to install.

=== Om 2007.2 images (GTK) ===

{{Main|Om 2007.2}}

Openmoko '''discontinued support''' for this release. 

Celtune offers different Images and a huge amount of packages (2007.2, pyneo, fso) for neo1973, freerunner and others. Celtune images can be found at http://rabenfrost.net/celtune/ .

[http://blog.automated.it/category/openmoko/ Andy Powell] maintains (or used to maintain ?) images based on the 2007.2 software stack for the gta01 and gta02. A. Powell's ScaredyCat images can be found at: http://buildhost.automated.it/OM2007.2/ .

=== FSO images (freesmartphone.org) ===

{{Main|OpenmokoFramework}}

The file system will be in a jffs2 "summary" file. A file with the extension ".jffs2.summary" can be flashed to the FreeRunner just like an ordinary jffs2 file.

=== Android ===
Android now can run on Openmoko FreeRunner.
