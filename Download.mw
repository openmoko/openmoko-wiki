This page lists various images you can try out on your Openmoko supported smartphone and some other downloads. Note however, that some of these are works in progress and may not have even released any files yet. Nothing is guaranteed to work. Proceed at your own risk.

== Distributions and installation ==

See [[Distributions]] for description of the images downloadable here.

See [[Flashing the Neo FreeRunner]] for installation instructions. Neo 1973 users: [[Getting Started with your Neo1973]]. In most cases you will download a Root FileSystem and a Kernel to flash into your phone. If you cannot find a kernel in the directory where you download the Root FS, please pick a kernel from an older directory.

If you want to copy a rootfs jffs2 to a ext2 filesystem to boot from a microSD card, see [[Userspace root image#Mounting the JFFS2 image on a loop back device (Block Memory MTD Emulation) | this]].
