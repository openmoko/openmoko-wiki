This page lists various images you can try out on your Openmoko supported smartphone and some other downloads. Note however, that some of these are works in progress and may not have even released any files yet. Nothing is guaranteed to work. Proceed at your own risk.

Unofficial users repositories can be found [[Users Repositories|here]]

== Distributions and installation ==

See [[Distributions]] for description of the images downloadable here.

See [[Flashing the Neo FreeRunner]] for installation instructions. Neo 1973 users: [[Getting Started with your Neo1973]]. 

In most cases you will download a Root FileSystem and a Kernel to flash into your phone. If you cannot find a kernel in the directory where you download the Root FS, please pick a kernel from an older directory. The third available file is the bootloader, probably don't want to install a new version of that unless there are bug fixes you really need.

If you want to install a system to a microSD card, see [[Booting from SD]].

=== Om 2008.8 images (ASU) ===
{{Main|Om 2008.8}}

==== Neo FreeRunner ====
Latest stable release: 
http://downloads.openmoko.org/releases/Om2008.8/ 

There should be some official updates for 2008.8 setup soon, but in the meantime, you'll have to wait.

There are *NO* updates available for 2008.08 anywhere on buildhost.openmoko.org - the daily-feeds directory is incompatible with 2008.08 and will corrupt your software configuration if you use it.
