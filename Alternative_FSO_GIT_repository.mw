The official FSO git repository is this one:

git.freesmartphone.org

Currently you can't use freesmartphone.org repository via http:// , so it can be a problem for users behind restrictive firewall.
[http://freesmartphone.org freesmartphone.org] git repository is mirrored to [http://repo.or.cz repo.or.cz]. Instead of:
<pre>
git clone git://git.freesmartphone.org/zhone
</pre>
you can use:
<pre>
git clone http://repo.or.cz/r/zhone
</pre>
And so on.
Have fun!
