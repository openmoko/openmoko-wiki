The official FSO git repository is this one:

git.freesmartphone.org

Currently you can't use freesmartphone.org repository via http:// , so it can be a problem for users behind restrictive firewall.
[http://freesmartphone.org freesmartphone.org] git repository is mirrored to [http://repo.or.cz repo.or.cz]. To use it just use instead of:

git clone git://git.freesmartphone.org/zhone


git clone http://repo.or.cz/r/zhone.git

Have fun!
