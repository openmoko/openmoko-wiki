==Introduction==

Sudoku is a logic-based number placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 boxes contains the digits from 1 to 9, only one time each (that is, exclusively).

Moko-Sudoku is simply a Sudoku game that should work on the size of touch-screen the Neos have.
