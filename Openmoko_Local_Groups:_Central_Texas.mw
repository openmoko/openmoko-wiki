Welcome to the Central Texas openmoko page!

We have a mailing list. Join our group to meet other local Openmoko users.  Details here: http://groups.google.com/group/austin-openmoko-users

This group is for Austin/Round Rock and surrounding areas. Hopefully we'll be able to organize an event for when a few of us get the neos. Local LUGs will probably be interested too, update here as it happens.
