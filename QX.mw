QX is a X-Server that runs under [[Qt Extended]]. Especially in the distribution [[QtMoko]] it is used to run applications like:
* [[Navit]] 
* [[Linphone]]
under Qt Extended. 

== Starting Applications ==
You can start applications that need the X-Server with the following steps in [[QtMoko]]:
# Open Main Menu by clicking on the green Q-Topia "Q"-Box.
# Open Applications (4 Boxes, red, yellow, green, blue)
# Scroll down and open QX
# Select the application that needs the X-Server (e.g. [[Navit]])
# Click on the white Paper Icon on the bottom left to open the context menu of the QX application.
# Select "Launch" to start application
With the AUX-Button you can exit the X-Server environment without quitting the application.

[[QX]] is the X-Server in QtMoko you can add favorites to the QX-Menu too by manual editing the files in:
  /opt/qtmoko/etc/qx
The file 
  favourites.conf
detemines the list of application you will see after starting [[QX]]. The file looks like this:
  [Apps]
  list=navit, tangogps
The applicationsnames must exist and need an entry in the <tt>profiles.conf</tt> file.
The file
  profiles.conf
defines the QX-settings for the application. E.g. navit needs the GPS-daemon to be started and the auto-dim function of the display is disabled. These settings can be defined for the applications individually. The file contain profile records like the following for <tt>tangogps</tt> and <tt>navit</tt>:

  [tangogps]
  antidim=true
  antisuspend=true
  gps=true
  init=gpsd /dev/ttySAC1
  kbd=false
  qvga=false
  rotate=false
  wm=true
 
  [navit]
  antidim=true
  antisuspend=true
  gps=true
  init=gpsd /dev/ttySAC1
  kbd=false
  qvga=false
  rotate=false
  wm=true

===Add to QX-Favourites===
You have installed or programmed an application  with the name <tt>myapp</tt>. Test the application in the QX-terminal if it works properly. Now we add this application <tt>myapp</tt> to the application list in <tt>favourites.conf</tt>. We do this e.g. with vi:
  # vi /opt/qtmoko/etc/qx/favourites.conf

The file look like this (press "I" for switching to INSERT mode):

  [Apps]
  list=navit, tangogps, myapp

add lines press ESC and :w for "write to file" and ":q" for "quit VI".
Now we have to add a profile record for <tt>myapp</tt> in file <tt>profiles.conf</tt>. We do this e.g. with vi:
  # vi /opt/qtmoko/etc/qx/profiles.conf
The file is depended on your settings could look like this  and e.g. the following lines (press "I" for switching to INSERT mode):

  [myapp]
  antidim=false
  antisuspend=true
  gps=false
  init=
  kbd=false
  qvga=false
  rotate=false
  wm=false

Then press "ESC" and ":w" for "write to file" and ":q" for "quit VI".

===Remove QX-Favorites===
You just have to remove the application name from the list of applications in:
  /opt/qtmoko/etc/qx/favorites.conf
You do not need to remove the application profile for your application in <tt>profiles.conf</tt>.
