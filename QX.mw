QX is a X-Server that runs under [[Qt Extended]]. Especially in the distribution [[QtMoko]] it is used to run applications like:
* [[Navit]] 
* [[Linphone]]
under Qt Extended. You can start applications that need the X-Server with the following steps in [[QtMoko]]:
# Open Main Menu by clicking on the green Q-Topia "Q"-Box.
# Open Applications (4 Boxes, red, yellow, green, blue)
# Scroll down and open QX
# Select the application that needs the X-Server (e.g. [[Navit]])
# Click on the white Paper Icon on the bottom left to open the context menu of the QX application.
# Select "Launch" to start application
With the AUX-Button you can exit the X-Server environment without quitting the application.
