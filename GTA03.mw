GTA03 is the codename of a phone that is going to be developped by Openmoko. For more information about other phones in development, visit [[Phone Development]]. The GTA03 will be based on the same system-on-a-chip as the [[Neo FreeRunner]] ([[GTA02 revisions|GTA02]]). It will presumably differ from it by having a 3.5 mm TRS audio connector (instead of a 2.5 mm connector), EDGE and a camera. GTA03 will not include support for 3G networks.
