GTA03 is the codename of a phone that is currently in development by Openmoko. For more information about other phones in development, visit [[Phone Development]]. The GTA03 will be based on a more advanced system-on-a-chip of same family as the [[Neo FreeRunner]] ([[GTA02 revisions|GTA02]]). It will presumably differ from it by having EDGE and a camera. GTA03 will not include support for 3G networks.
