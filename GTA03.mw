GTA03 is the codename of a phone that is currently in [[Phone Development|development]] by Openmoko. It seems as if it will not be available before Q3 2009. This [http://n2.nabble.com/Stage-of-GTA03-development--tp1664400p1803187.html post] from Steve Mosher gives more details.

The GTA03 will be based on a more advanced system-on-a-chip of same family as the [[Neo FreeRunner]] ([[GTA02 revisions|GTA02]]). It will presumably differ from it by having EDGE and a camera. GTA03 will not include support for 3G networks because of the high price of 3G chips for low volume phones [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-December/038395.html].
