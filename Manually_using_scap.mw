== Screen shot upload service scap ==

If you don't use the standard gui and your neo lacks the menu entry for scap you can do the same with a simple shell script:

 #!/bin/sh -e
 n=/tmp/scap$$.png
 fbgrab $n
 curl \
  -F file=@$n \
  -F key=secret \
  -F model=`uname -n` \
  -F submit=Upload \
  -F text=no\ comment \
  http://scap.linuxtogo.org/tickle.php
 rm $n

you need the packages for curl and fbgrab:

 ipkg install fbgrab curl

that's all.
