This page describes how to enable Calypso GSM modem deep sleep after performing a hardware fix of bug [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1024 #1024] aka recamping or oscillating of the Calypso GSM modem used in Openmoko [[Neo Freerunner]].

==Description==
Hardware bug #1024 creates a condition when the gsm modem is oscillating between registrated / not-registrated. This causes the phone to be unavailable at times. Distribution maintainers have been able to use a software setting to disable suspend of the gsm modem in order to work around this bug. The downside is that with this workaround the modem never sleeps and consumer more energy then needed.

If you decide to undergo a hardware fix of your phone you have to reconfigure your distribution to allow the gsm modem to go to sleep again in order to actually make use of the modem sleep function and therefore extend your battery life.

Bug trac: http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1024

==Bug detection==
Not every Freerunner suffers this issue. To check if your phone has the bug #1024 please use this test script:

(This script will only work on FSO based distro. Also, this script is not 100% perfect, another way is to use frameworkd with ti_calypso_sleep_mode = 'adaptive' and inspect the logs. Frameworkd will tell you, when a real recamping exists)

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/python

import dbus
import dbus.glib
import gobject
import datetime
   
def onNetworkStatus(status):
    if 'cid' in status:
        print '[%s] Signal : cid=%s, lac=%s' %  (datetime.datetime.now(),status['cid'],status['lac'] )
    else:
        print 'register first'

bus = dbus.SystemBus();

bus.add_signal_receiver(onNetworkStatus,
                        "Status",
                        "org.freesmartphone.GSM.Network",
                        "org.freesmartphone.ogsmd",
                        "/org/freesmartphone/GSM/Device")

gobject.threads_init()
dbus.glib.init_threads()
main_loop = gobject.MainLoop()
main_loop.run()
</pre>


Run it like this:

 root@om-gta02 ~ $ deep-sleep-check.py > dsc.log

If you have something like this:

 [2009-09-09 12:36:09.189663] Signal : cid=3BB3, lac=0D48
 [2009-09-09 12:36:15.088936] Signal : cid=3BB3, lac=0D48
 [2009-09-09 12:38:10.442808] Signal : cid=3BB3, lac=0D48
 [2009-09-09 12:38:13.020126] Signal : cid=3BB3, lac=0D48
 [2009-09-09 12:40:25.772918] Signal : cid=3BB3, lac=0D48
 [2009-09-09 12:40:28.620096] Signal : cid=3BB3, lac=0D48
 [2009-09-09 12:41:17.557676] Signal : cid=3BB3, lac=0D48
 [2009-09-09 12:41:20.404582] Signal : cid=3BB3, lac=0D48

Then you have the bug (trying to connect to GSM every second). Please note that cid is always the same.

Correct output might not show any messages or look like this:

 [2009-10-18 07:51:27.107655] Signal : cid=4E91, lac=006A
 [2009-10-18 07:52:45.145288] Signal : cid=4E7B, lac=006A
 [2009-10-18 07:53:18.218122] Signal : cid=4E91, lac=006A

You can see the cid changing.

==Bug detection by fso==
Just use frameworkd with ti_calypso_sleep_mode = 'adaptive' and inspect 
the logs. Frameworkd will tell you, when a real recamping exists.

==Hardware bug fixing==
To perform the hardware update, please check description here:

After the fix, please recheck again with the script as above. Under normal circumstances you would only see these messages with a change of cell, so cid would be different.

If your fix was successful you can change setting to allow Calypso deep sleep:

==Enabling/allowing Calypso GSM modem deep sleep==
===FSO based distros (SHR, Debian, OM2009...)===

Edit /etc/frameworkd.conf , it should contain:

 ti_calypso_deep_sleep = always

Then restart framework or reboot the phone.

 /etc/init.d/frameworkd restart

===FSO2 based distros (SHR, Debian)===

Edit /etc/freesmartphone/conf/GTA02/fsogsmd.conf and add this to the to the modem_init

 ;%SLEEP=2

===QT based distos (Qtopia, QTExtended, QTMoko...)===

Edit /opt/qtmoko/etc/default/Trolltech/Modem.conf , it should contain:
 
 [DeepSleep]
 Active=yes

And reboot.

===Hackable:1 (rev.5)===

As said in http://lists.hackable1.org/pipermail/hackable1-user/2010-January/000718.html and other discussions:
hackable:1 does not use frameworkd but gsmd.

To enable deep-sleep mode:

-download and install (or extract)
 http://build.hackable1.org/debian/dists/wip/main/binary-armel/gsmd_0.0.2+svn1571-1_armel.deb
-edit /etc/default/gsmd and uncomment the "VENDOR=ti-deepsleep" line: this will add a 
 "-v ti-deepsleep" to the deamon command line. 
-Restart gsmd.
 
===Android===

Currently Android on Freerunner is hard coded to use AT%SLEEP=2 to avoid deep  sleep mode entirely; there is a discussion about providing editable property in Androids init.rc startup file.
