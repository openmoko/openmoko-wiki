This page is about about enabling Calypso GSM modem deep sleep after hardware fix of bug #1024 aka recamping or oscilating of the Calypso GSM modem used in Openmoko Freerunner.

Hardware bug #1024 creates a condition when the gsm modem is oscillating between registrated / not-registrated. This causes the phone to be unavailable at times. Distribution maintainers have been able to disable suspend of the gsm modem which worked around this bug. The downside is that after this the modem never sleeps and consumer more energy then needed.

If you decide to undergo a hardware fix of your phone, you have to reconfigure our distribution to allow the gsm modem to go to sleep in order to actually make use of the modem sleep function and therefore extend your battery life.

Not every Freerunner suffers this issue. To check if your phone has the bug #1024, please use [[this]] script (todo: add link, describe output on good and bad behaviour).

To perform the hardware update, please check description here: http://www.neofundas.blogspot.com/ 

After the fix, please recheck again with the script as above.

After the fix, you will have to change setting to allow Calypso deep sleep:

'''FSO based distros (SHR, OM2009...)'''

Edit /etc/frameworkd.conf , it should contain:

 ti_calypso_deep_sleep = always

Then restart farmework or reboot the phone.

 /etc/init.d/frameworkd restart
 


'''QT based distos (Qtopia, QTExtended, QTMoko...)'''

Edit /opt/qtmoko/etc/default/Trolltech/Modem.conf , it should contain:
 
 [DeepSleep]
 Active=always
 
 Android ???
