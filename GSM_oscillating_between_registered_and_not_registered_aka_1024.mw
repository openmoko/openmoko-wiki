On this wiki i have found very little info about bug #1024 aka recamping or oscilating of the Calypso GSM modem used in Openmoko Freerunner.I will try to collect place information about 1024 here.

Links:

 Ticket: http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1024

To check if you suffer the bug #1024, please use [[this]] script (todo: add link, describe output on good and bad behaviour).

To perform the hardware update, please check description [[here http://www.neofundas.blogspot.com/]].

After the fix, please recheck again with the script as above.

After the fix, you will have to change setting to allow Calypso deep sleep (todo: describe three possible fixes).
