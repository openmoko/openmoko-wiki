'''Short description''':

The purpose of this project is to allow the mobile user to transfer his
video stream, along with GPS data, back to the back-end server in real-time.
That is, while the user is moving in the field, recorded video stream with
tagged GPS data will interactively send back to the server for storage. One
of the possible usages of this system is that user can save his on-line
video file back to his blog and embedded into a map with the help of GPS
data.
