Moved from [[Neo1973 Debug Board v2]]

==== FT2232D EEPROM ====

Your Debug Board contains a small serial EEPROM which should be flashed correctly during production.  However, some boards have received incorrect/incomplete programming during production and thus you should verify this.

If the board shows up as USB ID 1457:5118, then everything is correct.

Only if your board shows up as USB ID 0403:6010, then you will need to flash the board!

===== Flashing with Linux =====

{{note|FIC has done that for you, in case you have officially been supplied with the board.  However, if you are one of the early adopters, the configuration and USB vendorID / productID might have not yet been set correctly.}}

In order to do so, you can use the ftdi_eeprom program from 
http://www.intra2net.com/de/produkte/opensource/ftdi/. Unfortunately, the latest version (0.2) doesn't yet contain support for our FT2232D, so you need the patch from http://people.openmoko.org/laforge/misc/debug_board_v2/ftdi_eeprom/ftdi_eeprom-0.2-moko.patch

You may also need to apply the following patch to libftdi:
http://people.openmoko.org/werner/libftdi-c56-strings-dirty-hack.patch
(See http://bugzilla.openmoko.org/cgi-bin/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=321 for additional details.)

Furthermore, you will need the EEPROM config:
http://people.openmoko.org/laforge/misc/debug_board_v2/ftdi_eeprom/neo1973_debug_board_v2.ftdi

Once you have compiled ftdi_eeprom, you can run
 ftdi_eeprom --flash-eeprom neo1973_debug_board_v2.ftdi

{{warning|Make sure you don't have any other FTDI FT232 / FT2232 based devices attached to the USB while running ftdi_eeprom.  It might be wise to disconnect everything but the debug board}}

You should get something like the following printout if everything was successful:
<pre>
FTDI eeprom generator v0.2
(c) Intra2net AG <opensource@intra2net.com>
FTDI init: 0
Unable to find FTDI devices under given vendor/product id: 0x1457/0x5118
Retrying with default FTDI id.
Used eeprom space: 102 bytes
FTDI write eeprom: 0
Writing to file: neo1973_debug_board_v2.eeprom
FTDI close: 0
</pre>

Once the flashing has finished, just disconnect and reconnect, and you should see

===== Flashing with Windows =====
{{note|FIC has done that for you, in case you have officially been supplied with the board.  However, if you are one of the early adopters, the configuration and USB vendorID / productID might have not yet been set correctly.}}

In order to do so, you can use the FTDI Mprog program from http://www.ftdichip.com/Resources/Utilities/MProg3.0_Setup.exe
 
You will need
