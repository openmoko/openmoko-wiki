== Presentation ==
'''Mokometeo''' is a small python/GTK application fetching the weather forecast from Yahoo weather pages

== Installation ==

=== Dependencies ===
You need '''python-pygtk''' and '''glade''' to make it work.

=== OM and SHR ===

So to install it, you can do :
 opkg install glade http://www.opkg.org/packages/mokometeo_0.1_arm.ipk

Also need dependancies (on SHR testing) :
 opkg install python-netclient

== Using Mokometeo ==
* Before to run it, you must be connected to internet. If not, it will crash or do nothing (will improve this in a short future)
* Just click on the desktop icon [[Image:Mokometeo.png|30px]] called "Mokometeo" to load the software.

You will see a window appearing, with a 4 days forecast : Today, tomorrow (J+1), the day after (J+2) , etc.

You can use the Next and Previous buttons to change the displayed city.

Enjoy !

== Configuring Mokometeo ==

* By default, 2 cities are configured. You can change the cities and add more in the file
 ~/.mokometeo/mokometeo.conf
This file must contains at minimum 2 lines. The first line is
 city,url
The second and next lines is the name of the city, and the url (tested with french yahoo weather urls), for example:
 Paris,http://fr.weather.yahoo.com/FRXX/FRXX0076/index_c.html


== Changelog ==

== Future improvements / To do list ==
* need to test first if there is some network connection. Now it crashes if the freerunner is not connected
* record the last fetched information, and diplay it (with is date+time) if in deconnected mode
* improve the way the connection to Yahoo is handled, and do it the proper and safe way (any ideas ?)
* test with different languages / locations
* improve the quality of the uggly python code (I am a beginner, advice waited :D  )
