== Presentation ==
'''Mokometeo''' is a small python/elementary application fetching the weather forecast from WeatherUnderground weather pages

== Installation ==

=== Dependencies ===
You need '''python-elementary''', '''python-html''' and '''python-netclient''' to make it work.

=== OM and SHR ===

So to install it, you can do :
 opkg install python-elementary python-netclient python-html http://www.opkg.org/packages/mokometeo_0.5_arm.ipk

Also need dependancies (on SHR testing) :
 opkg install python-netclient

== Using Mokometeo ==

* For version 0.5, once the package (and dependencies) is installed, simply click on the desktop icon. A default configuration file <tt>~/.mokometeo.cfg</tt> will be created which can be edited to your liking. Previous and next locations are selected using the buttons at the bottom of the screen, and if a network connection is active the forecast can be updated using the Refresh button. The forecast for all locations is saved in the configuration file so that a network connection is not necessary for switching locations after starting mokometeo. The middle area (containing the forecast information) is now scrollable using the standard elementary finger scrolling action.

* In the 0.2 version, there is a bug. To be able to use Mokometeo, please type theses commands before launching it:
 mkdir /home/root/.mokometeo
 mkdir /home/root/.mokometeo/img
 cp /usr/share/mokometeo/question.png /home/root/.mokometeo/img/

* for the german 0.3, you don't need this

* Just click on the desktop icon [[Image:Mokometeo.png|30px]] called "Mokometeo" to load the software.

* You will see a window appearing, with a 4 days forecast : Today, tomorrow (J+1), the day after (J+2) , etc.

* You can use the Next and Previous buttons to change the displayed city.

* If you have no internet connection, you will have to wait a little bit, and then the window will show "question marks" and "-" as min and max temperatures

* Next time you starup Mokometeo, the last fetched data will be displayed.

Enjoy !

== Configuring Mokometeo ==

=== Version 0.5 ===

The configuration file <tt>~/.mokometeo.cfg</tt> has a section named <tt>[Main]</tt> which looks like:

 [Main]
 units = celsius
 lastview = 0
 locations = Melbourne,AU:Perth,AU:Paris,FR

The locations line can be edited and colon (:) separated locations of your choice added. I've found that <tt><city>,<country abbreviation></tt> works well with the WeatherUnderground API. It's probably worth checking using this URL:

 http://api.wunderground.com/auto/wui/geo/GeoLookupXML/index.xml?query=Melbourne,AU

(or similar) to make sure it returns the location you're expecting.

The units line can also be changed to <tt>fahrenheit</tt> if desired.

=== Previous versions ===

* By default, 2 cities are configured. You can change the cities and add more in the file
 ~/.mokometeo/mokometeo.conf
This file must contains at minimum 2 lines. The first line is
 city,url
The second and next lines is the name of the city, and the url (tested with french yahoo weather urls), for example:
 Paris,http://fr.weather.yahoo.com/FRXX/FRXX0076/index_c.html

== Changelog ==

=== 2009-12-14 - v0.5 ===

* Now uses the elementary GUI instead of Gtk+.
* Now uses the Weather Underground site instead of Yahoo weather (better API).
* Six days of forecast available.
* Now uses a single file (<tt>~/.mokometeo.cfg</tt>) for configuration and location history. The .mokometeo directory is no longer needed.
* Weather icons are not downloaded on the fly, they're part of the package.
* History is saved for all defined locations

=== 2009-03-13 - v0.2 ===
* added some "print" in the code
* debug the .mokometeo folder ; put the config folder in /home/root/.mokometeo/ instead of /.mokometeo/
* test if the connection to internet is ok. If not, display question marks
* backup the data each time data is downloaded and displayed. This data is used on the next Mokometeo startup
* added the date and time when the data has been downloaded

=== 2009-03-12 - v0.1 ===
initial version


== Future improvements / To do list ==
* Use the GUI to add/remove locations
* <s>debug the initial copy of /usr/share/mokometeo/question.png into /home/root/.mokometeo/img/</s>
* <s>improve the way the connection to Yahoo is handled</s>
* test with different languages / locations
* <s>handle backup data for each city in the config file</s>
