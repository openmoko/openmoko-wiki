== Overview ==
This article defines the second revision of the Today Application, an application designed for the OpenMoko platform.

The Today application is the entry point for the user. It therefore resides on the 'desktop' of the phone, and is used for the following:
1) Quickly finding out the status of phone & calender related items.
2) Launch a new application.
3) Manage running applications i.e. Switch to or close a running application.

== Use Cases ==
Here are some possible use cases:
* I want to be able to view at a glance today's Calendar Events and To Do Items.
* I want to launch an application.
* I want to switch to a running application.
