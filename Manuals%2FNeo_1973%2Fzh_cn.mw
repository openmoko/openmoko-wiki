这是一个对刚拿到[[Neo1973]]手机的人很有用的上手指南。

== 硬件 ==

=== 拆解 ===

Google视频上有一些拆解演示: [http://video.google.de/videoplay?docid=-8343770443102960945 打开后盖、拿走电池、拿走SIM卡、拿走micro-SD卡、插入micro-SD卡、插 SIM卡、插入电池、合上后盖]

micro-SD插槽在SIM插槽下面，SIM插槽在电池插槽下面，最上面是手机后盖。

[[SIM]]卡和[[micro-SD]]存储卡是可选的；SIM用于需要蜂窝网络功能的时候，存储卡用于需要外部存储的时候。

==== 后盖 ====

打开后盖，把指甲或者吉他片插入Neo顶部的小凹坑，轻轻地拉起后盖(参见[[Disassembling Neo1973]]中的第一步)。

装上后盖，把后盖底部的安装脚插入Neo的底部安装孔，轻轻地合上顶部。

==== 电池 ====

用指甲撬电池底边，取下电池 [[battery]]

Before closing the cover, insert the battery by pushing it against the three metal springs with the contacts aligned and pressing the bottom edge of the battery down into the case.

==== SIM卡（可选） ====

[[SIM card]]从蜂窝网络运营商那里获得。SIM卡插槽在电池下面。在金属安装架上有箭头和文字标明了锁和解锁的方法 - 不要强力打开，否则可能导致金属架折断.

Click the holder unlocked and open it up. To remove the SIM card, slide it out of the holder.

When you're done with the micro-SD slot, slide the SIM card into its holder so that the pads make contact when you close the holder. Push the holder firmly against the springs, then lock it - otherwise the card will not be detected.

To check in Linux if the SIM card is inserted correctly, you can have a look in gsmd logs or use the instructions detailed in the [[Manually using GSM]] page and issue the ''AT+CIMI'' command.

==== Micro-SD卡（可选） ====

You should have received a [[micro-SD]] memory card with your phone. You might want to copy some mp3 (or better Ogg Vorbis) files to it to try media playback.

The micro-SD slot is right under the SIM slot. Gently slide the micro-SD holder toward the battery contacts to unlock it. Lift up the holder. To remove a card, simply slide it out.

To insert a card, slide it into the holder the metal contacts first and away from the holder. Rotate the holder shut, press it firmly against the springs, and gently slide the holder away from the battery contacts to lock it closed.

The card should automatically be available under /media/card the next time you boot. You can test it and your audio drivers at the same time by playing an mp3 or ogg from it (see [[Neo1973 Audio Subsystem]]).

=== 按钮 ===

The [[Neo1973 Power Button|power button]] is on the lower right-hand side, and the [[Neo1973 AUX Button|AUX button]] is on the top-left.

Button functions while the phone is on (as of writing):
* 短时间按电源: 关闭当前应用程序
* 按住电源1秒: 打开 [[电源管理菜单]]
* 按住电源10秒: 强制关机
* 短时间按AUX button : 打开 [[Today]] 程序
* 按住AUX button 1秒: 打开 [[functions menu]]

=== 附件 ===

==== 触摸笔 ====

The stylus as shipped has three batteries in it, providing for the laser pointer and flashlight LEDs. A set of replacement batteries is also included. The stylus can be twisted open in middle to access the batteries.

To use the ballpoint or stylus head, turn the bottom part of the stylus to either direction.

==== 耳机 ====

The Neo ships with a stereo headset including a microphone and a push button. The plug is a standard 2.5 mm four-conductor version, though it differs from standard 3.5 mm headphones. The black socket is on the left side of the phone, and the last millimeter is somewhat firmer so make sure you push the plug all the way.

==== 挂绳 ====

The provided lanyard can be attached to the hole in the bottom part of the phone. Put the loose end through the phone, through the two metal loops in the lanyard, between the metal loops and back through the first metal loop.

=== 手机开机 ===
[[Image:Neo1973_uboot_splash.jpg|200px|thumb|bootloader splash screen]]
Just hitting the power button (depending on your [[u-boot]] version you have to press for >= 5 seconds) should get the phone first into the bootloader, then boot the kernel, and get into  X/Openmoko. The shipped battery typically has enough charge to boot up directly without charging through the usb cable first.

Once you have pressed the power button sufficiently long, the vibrator makes a short pulse and the screen backlight turns on. You can now release the power button and watch the phone booting.

If the battery is not sufficiently charged, the phone will not turn on, even if the usb cable is plugged in.

=== 刷机 Neo1973 GTA01Bv4 ===
The GTA01Bv4 devices that are currently shipping do not boot out of the box.  Flashing the phone with the latest kernel and [[Userspace root image|supporting file system ("rootfs")]] is required before the phone will successfully boot.

Read more information at about [[Flashing the Neo 1973]]. MacOS X users please also refer to [[MacOS_X]].

=== 手机关机 ===

==== 如果在电话启动过程中死机(bootloader模式) ====

按电源开关键持续9秒，电话关机。这时可以看到屏幕背光关闭。

==== 正在运行linux操作系统时 ====

在这种模式下，只需要长按电源键5秒。然后，init例程将小心而且安全地关闭电话，整个过程可能需要20秒。X窗口也将被关闭，系统将回到console模式（可能显示有点混乱），然后电话被关闭。这个关机过程很像普通的桌面Linux。

=== 充电 ===
:''See also [[Neo1973 Battery Charger]]
The [[Neo1973]] supports two charging modes: One 100mA charge mode (called pre-charge) and 500mA (called fast charge).  Charging is always done via the USB socket.  You can use any USB-A to USB-mini-B cable to connect the phone to any USB host.

Note: If the Neo1973 battery completely drains it's possible that even after a long recharge you might not be able to power the phone on.  To fix that you need to remove the battery, and leave it out for about a minute, then replace the battery and plug the phone back into a usb port.  You should be able to power it on after a few minutes of charging.

==== 在 u-boot 模式====

While you are in u-boot mode, the phone only charges with 100mA by default.  (This will change in one of the future revisions).

However, using the u-boot console you can manually enable fast charging. See [[U-boot#Battery_charger_related]] for more information.

==== 在 Linux 模式====

As soon as the phone is connected via USB cable, it will charge.  However, the default charging current is only 100mA, way too little if you want to operate the phone and charge at the same time.

If your USB upstream port is capable of supplying 500mA, then it will configure the Neo1973 accordingly and use 500mA charging mode.  You can notice this by the following line in the kernel log (/var/log/messages) of the Neo1973:
usb0: full speed config #1: 500 mA, Ethernet Gadget, using CDC Ethernet

== Getting shell access on the phone ==

=== By using the terminal emulator and on-screen keyboard ===

In [[Today]] (the main screen the phone boots to and which can always be accessed by pressing the [[AUX button]]), selecting (with a stylus or a thumb) the "+" tab in the center bottom of the screen shows the application launcher. Make sure the filter at the top of the window is set at "Applications" or "All", then drag upward on the list to scroll it until the Terminal application appears. Alternatively, you can toggle the magnifier glass in the filter and type "terminal" to the text box that appears. Click the application in the list to make it turn yellow and start - this might be difficult a first since any movement is interpreted as dragging rather than clicking.

The on-screen keyboard should appear whenever you choose a text entry. It can also be toggled by clicking on the tiny keyboard icon in the panel at the very top of the screen. More options are available via Input Manager which can be started in the application launcher filtered by "Utilities" or "All". A white box appears in the panel. It also can be used to toggle the keyboard. You can choose between different keyboard layouts and the stroke recognizer by dragging from the white box to the right of the box, which should make a menu appear.

=== By using Ethernet emulation over a USB cable ===

The standard Neo1973 Linux [[kernel]] has support for the "cdc_ether USB gadget", i.e. a standard implementation of how to emulate an Ethernet device over USB.

The following description is for generic *NIX system. For setting up connectivity specifically on a MacOS X machine, refer to [[MacOS_X]] (because there is no usb0 and you need a special kernel driver first).

As soon as the kernel is up and running, and you have the phone connected via USB, you should get a '''usb0''' device on your host.

The Phone will have the IPv4 address 192.168.0.202/24.  You can run `ifconfig` in the terminal on the phone to verify this (this is optional, just check it if it doesn't work given the instructions below)

If you plug a USB cable into a laptop running Linux, you'll likely see the "cdc_ether" kernel module being loaded and a usb0 network interface appear. If not, see [[USB_Networking]] for more details.

On the '''host PC''', you should then configure your interface to 192.168.0.200 by using
# ifconfig usb0 192.168.0.200 netmask 255.255.255.0

Then you should be able to
# ping 192.168.0.202

and last, but not least
# ssh root@192.168.0.202

Once you press 'enter' (empty password), you should now have a root login.

See [[USB_Networking]] for more details, including instructions on how to automatically setup masquerading so that your phone can get access to the internet through the host PC.

Note: If you have a power management profile enabled on your device your ssh connection might appear to freeze when your phone tries to sleep.  To stop this from occuring you need to hold the power button down for a few seconds until you get the menu with the "Power Off" option at the bottom.  Once you do, you should select the "Profile: No PM" option.  If your shell died and you want it back, you can do the following:

# modprobe -r cdc_ether
# modprobe -r cdc_acm

Then unplug the device and plug it back in after turning power-management off.

=== By using the debug board/serial/JTAG ===

Please see [[Debug Board#Usage_Instructions]]

== Getting access to the bootloader console ==

Please see [[u-boot#Using_usbtty_from_Linux]]

== Using Audio ==
=== Enable Internal Speaker and Mic in Phone Calls ===
If you got no Speaker and Mic during a Call you need to load the "gsmhandset.state" alsa-configfile

alsactl -f /etc/alsa/gsmhandset.state restore

Maybe you need to load another .state file for playing mp3 or a BT-Headset see in /etc/alsa/

To hear something you can find an .au file (or convert a .wav into an .au by using the sox tool):

sox ringtone_thereisnophone.wav -t raw -r 8012 -u -b -c 1 rigtone_thereisnophone.au

copy it to the device and run

cat ringtone_thereisnophone.au > /dev/dsp

== Useful commands in Linux ==

=== Suspending ===

Writing "mem" into ''/sys/power/state'' tells Linux to suspend - it will enter a low power mode where only the GSM and RAM are powered up and the CPU sleeps.  It will persist in this state until a wake-up event arrives.  Some currently enabled wake-up events are: AUX or POWER key press, USB cable detect.

If you're connected over ssh, sshd will stop responding when the OS suspends, so to avoid locking up your ssh client, use the command
# (sleep 1; echo mem > /sys/power/state) & exit

=== Initial backup ===

After getting your new Neo1973 booted for the first time you might want to make a back up of the original flash chip contents on your PC, before you overwrite the flash with a custom image or just update to a newer build.

{{note|For phase 0 developers only (GTA01Bv4 shippment 0, '''not &gt; 0 '''): This is a good idea because there are parts in the root filesystem that can't be distributed over internet so they are only found in the shipped ROM (see the [[GPS]] driver).}}

One easy way to back up all of the Flash, that doesn't require installing any special software, is with ''netcat'' over the [[USB Networking|USB ethernet]].  The following commands can be used for that.
{|
! On the host !! On the target
|-
|<pre>
$ nc -l -p 20000 > mtdblock0
$ nc -l -p 20000 > mtdblock1
$ nc -l -p 20000 > mtdblock2
$ nc -l -p 20000 > mtdblock3
$ nc -l -p 20000 > mtdblock4
</pre>
|<pre>
# cat /dev/mtdblock0 | nc 192.168.0.200 20000
# cat /dev/mtdblock1 | nc 192.168.0.200 20000
# cat /dev/mtdblock2 | nc 192.168.0.200 20000
# cat /dev/mtdblock3 | nc 192.168.0.200 20000
# cat /dev/mtdblock4 | nc 192.168.0.200 20000
</pre>
|}

This stores the five NAND partitions in files named mtdblock*.  Knowing the partition layout (u-boot "mtdparts" command or Linux dmesg) you can restore the whole flash with it.

=== Setting date and time ===

To set the date and time you need to open a terminal or ssh to the device. To set the date and time to August 9 19:02 2007 type:

# date -s 080919022007

The screensaver might turn on as you execute this command - just tap the screen to get back.

Now, you need to synchronize the time with the hardware date/time by typing:

# hwclock --systohc

=== Where to from here ===

You'll probably want to play with some of the interesting hardware in this device. Obviously, you can explore the applications available through the touch-screen interface. But for those who prefer doing things more in the raw from a shell prompt, you can [[Manually_using_GSM | manually use GSM]], [[Manually_using_SMS | manually use SMS]],  or you can start playing with the [[GPS]].
