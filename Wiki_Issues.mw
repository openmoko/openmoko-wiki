==Wiki Pages==
===Pages capable of development===
* [[Openmoko:Community Portal]]
* [[Documentation]]
* [[AGPSD]] (Needs new GPS info)
* [[AR6K]] (Needs more info)
* [[GTA02 partitions]]: seems to be about the GTA01; could someone with a GTA02 please correct the partition sizes and names?

===Redundant Pages===
* There are several pages concerning Openmoko compatible service providers:
** [[Carriers]], most up-to-date, confirmed service providers.
*** [[Carriers/ATT]]
*** [[Carriers/TMobile]]
*** [[Carriers/Fido]]
*** [[Carriers/Rogers]]
** [[Openmoko compatible cellphone providers]]
** [[Neo1973 compatible cellphone providers]]

*I suggest merging the editing help pages:
**[[Help:Editing]]
**[[Editing wiki]]
**[[Edit Wiki]]

*pages about GPS:
**[[Hardware:AGPS]]
**[[Gpsd]]
**[[Neo 1973 GPS]]
**[[Neo FreeRunner GPS]]

*applications:
**[[Available Packages]]
**[[Applications]]

===Tidy up===
* [[Wishlist:Text Input]] - tidy up/sort, give short feedback to each method

==Categories ==

===General issues with categories===
* Please read wikipedia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categorization Categorization] page and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:FAQ/Categorization FAQ]
* There are way too many [[Special:Categories| categories]].
* The [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Openmoko_Wiki_Categories_Index_Page categories index] is static and therefore out of date.
* The [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Openmoko_Wiki_Official_Index_Page wiki index] is another static categorization. It is therefore out of date. Moreover, it seems strictly hierarchical, while actually pages should be described with multiple categories, and categories can have multiple parents.
* There should be a small number of a orthogonal category trees, each describing one consistent conceptual taxonomy.
* Ideally categories should not include language, if we don't do so the list of pages is cluttered.
* There should be only one category taxonomy for the "Neo type" with subcategories "FreeRunner", "Neo1973", "GTA03"... Otherwise, categories should not include the Neo type.
* Another big taxonomy can be based on the layers model. "Hardware", "Drivers", "Operating system", "Framework", "Applications", "Distributions". With many subcategories here.
* A taxonomy of technical level of expertise "General public", "Beginners", "Users", "Experts".
* A taxonomy by function or by subsystem: "Phone", "Wifi", "GPS/GPRS modem", "USB", "Bluetooth", "Accelerometers", "Audio", "Power", "SD card", "Serial bus", "Display", "Accessories", "Debug board"
* A taxonomy by maturity: "Wishlist", "Experimental", "Unstable", "Testing", "Stable".

===Lists now implemented as categories===
These Pages are now implemented as categories, thus the unmaintaned pages could be removed. - Kempelen
* [[Advanced_End-user]]: use [[:Category:User]] instead
* [[Basic_End-user]]: use [[:Category:User]] instead
* [[System_Developer]]: use [[:Category:System_Developers]] instead
* [[Application_Developer]]: use [[:Category:Application_Developer]] instead

===Too general category names===

These end up in mixed content. They could be removed and content migrated to more specific category names.

(1) We've moved Openmoko Inc related info from Openmoko to a new Openmoko Inc category. This was the original aim of the Openmoko category when it was created.

== DolfjeBot1 proposals ==
Their is a bot on the openmoko wiki that's controlled by [[User:Dolfje]]. If you have tasks for the bot, please put them [[User:DolfjeBot1|here]].

==Wiki engine issues==
Can we please install/fix the following features for this wiki:
* '''Math''' - the Tex math markup does not work currently. Test:
** <math> z =\left (1-\left(\frac{P_{ind}}{101.325}\right)^{0.190263} \right ) \times \frac{87.828}{0.00198122} </math>
** <math> P_{ind} </math>
* [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi '''Syntax''' Highlighting - makes code much more readable]
* [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:GraphViz GraphViz] works with the commonly known dot language - it allows us to draw '''graphs''' using easy markup.
* [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:AnyWikiDraw AnyWikiDraw] allows us to draw svg '''diagrams''' directly on the wiki page.
* Make '''visited links''' a different color.

== Change Sitename ==

The name of this wiki is currently "Openmoko". I think it should be "Openmoko Wiki" for the following reasons:

* The other parts of this site (Planet, Projects, Docs) have similar names
* Media Wiki automatically creates a [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Namespace namespace] for the Sitename (currently "Openmoko"). This means that content of pages beginning with "Openmoko:" cannot be found through the normal search function of this wiki. (At the moment there are six pages of this kind: [[Openmoko:About]], [[Openmoko:Community Portal]], [[Openmoko:Current events]], [[Openmoko:Searching]], [[Openmoko:Current events/it]], [[Openmoko:Privacy policy]])--[[User:Marko Knöbl|Marko Knöbl]] 18:33, 8 August 2008 (UTC)

== Organize translations ==

I suggest moving the translations to sub-wikis, like the way wikipedia does it. Currently all translations show up in searches and under category-lists. --[[User:Johndoesacc|Johndoesacc]] 12:03, 25 August 2008 (UTC)


== Rejected requests ==

When a requested Wiki Issue is voted for not to be done, it must be moved here, to make sure it won't get continously requested again.

* '''Don't translate the wiki - rejected''' proposed by [[User:Minime|Minime]] August 2007, moved to rejected by [[User:Kempelen|Kempelen]] August 2008: the Documentation Team looks to support the idea.
