If you think something is wrong with a Wiki page or with this Wiki in general, please add your thoughts to this list. You may just want to read existing proposals and put your vote on them, [[Wiki Maintainers]] will appreciate.

When adding an issue please

Accepted and implemented requests should be deleted. Rejected requests should be moved to the bottom of the page to avoid requesting them again.

==Wiki Pages==
===Pages capable of development===
* [[OpenMoko:Community Portal]]
* [[Documentation]]
* [[AGPSD]] (Needs new GPS info)
* [[AR6K]] (Needs more info)

===Redundant Pages===
* There are several pages concerning OpenMoko compatible service providers:
** [[Carriers]], most up-to-date, confirmed service providers.
*** [[Carriers/ATT]]
*** [[Carriers/TMobile]]
*** [[Carriers/Fido]]
*** [[Carriers/Rogers]]
** [[OpenMoko compatible cellphone providers]]
** [[Neo1973 compatible cellphone providers]]

*I suggest merging the editing help pages:
**[[Help:Editing]]
**[[Editing wiki]]
**[[Edit Wiki]]

===Tidy up===
* [[Wishlist:Text Input]] - tidy up/sort, give short feedback to each method
* [[Booting_from_SD]] - tidy up and a rewrite

===Categories ===

These Pages are now implemented as categories, thus the unmaintaned pages could be removed. - Kempelen
* [[Advanced_End-user]]: use [[:Category:User]] instead
* [[Basic_End-user]]: use [[:Category:User]] instead
* [[System_Developer]]: use [[:Category:System_Developers]] instead
* [[Application_Developer]]: use [[:Category:Application_Developer]] instead

===Too general category names===

These end up in mixed content. They could be removed and content migrated to more specific category names.

(1) We've moved Openmoko Inc related info from Openmoko to a new Openmoko Inc category. This was the original aim of the Openmoko category when it was created.

==Wiki engine issues==
Can we please install/fix the following features for this wiki:
* '''Math''' - the Tex math markup does not work currently. Test:
** <math> z =\left (1-\left(\frac{P_{ind}}{101.325}\right)^{0.190263} \right ) \times \frac{87.828}{0.00198122} </math>
** <math> P_{ind} </math>
* [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi '''Syntax''' Highlighting - makes code much more readable]
* [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:GraphViz GraphViz] works with the commonly known dot language - it allows us to draw '''graphs''' using easy markup.
* [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:AnyWikiDraw AnyWikiDraw] allows us to draw svg '''diagrams''' directly on the wiki page.
* Make '''visited links''' a different color.

==Wiki languages==
Translating ''this'' wiki into other languages does not make much sense:
* All translated pages need to be kept up-to-date. The people translating will not see every change made.
* A partly (and often quite badly) done translation is no good.
* People who use this wiki are sophisticated users, they are very likely to know English. They will not use localised pages as they do not trust them in matters of being up-to-date.
* Rather create another wiki/information page with more static information for regular mass-market purchaser that do not care about 20 ways to connect their OpenMoko device with their PC but just about one easy one.

:I agree that technical pages don't need translating. However, I think that there are some pages for regular users which should be translated. Probably we could create a short list of pages which should be translated into other languages and prevent editors from translating other pages. --[[User:Marko Knöbl|Marko Knöbl]] 16:15, 6 August 2008 (UTC)

== Change Sitename ==

The name of this wiki is currently "Openmoko". I think it should be "Openmoko Wiki" for the following reasons:

* The other parts of this site (Planet, Projects, Docs) have similar names
* Media Wiki automatically creates a [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Namespace namespace] for the Sitename (currently "Openmoko"). This means that content of pages beginning with "Openmoko:" cannot be found through the normal search function of this wiki. (At the moment there are six pages of this kind: [[Openmoko:About]], [[Openmoko:Community Portal]], [[Openmoko:Current events]], [[Openmoko:Searching]], [[Openmoko:Current events/it]], [[Openmoko:Privacy policy]])--[[User:Marko Knöbl|Marko Knöbl]] 18:33, 8 August 2008 (UTC)

== Rejected requests ==

When a requested Wiki Issue is voted for not to be done, it must be moved here, to make sure it won't get continously requested again.
