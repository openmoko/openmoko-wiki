==Wiki Pages==
===Pages capable of development===
* [[Openmoko:Community Portal]]
* [[Documentation]]
* [[AGPSD]] (Needs new GPS info)
* [[AR6K]] (Needs more info)
* [[GTA02 partitions]]: seems to be about the GTA01; could someone with a GTA02 please correct the partition sizes and names?
* [[Advanced_End-user]], [[Basic_End-user]], [[System_Developer]], [[Application_Developer]]: These are not up to the standard we set for List Pages on [[Openmoko_Wiki_Editing_Guidelines#List_pages]] [[User:Kempelen|Kempelen]]

===Redundant Pages===
* There are several pages concerning Openmoko compatible service providers:
** [[Carriers]], most up-to-date, confirmed service providers.
*** [[Carriers/ATT]]
*** [[Carriers/TMobile]]
*** [[Carriers/Fido]]
*** [[Carriers/Rogers]]
** [[Neo1973 compatible cellphone providers]]

*I suggest merging the editing help pages:
**[[Help:Editing]]
**[[Edit Wiki]]

*pages about GPS:
**[[Hardware:AGPS]]
**[[Gpsd]]
**[[Neo 1973 GPS]]
**[[Neo FreeRunner GPS]]

*applications:
**[[Available Packages]]
**[[Applications]]

===Tidy up===
* [[Wishlist:Text Input]] - tidy up/sort, give short feedback to each method
* [[Booting_from_SD]] - tidy up and a rewrite

==Categories ==

===General issues with categories===
* Please read wikipedia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categorization Categorization] page and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:FAQ/Categorization FAQ]
* There are way too many [[Special:Categories| categories]].
* The [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Openmoko_Wiki_Categories_Index_Page categories index] is static and therefore out of date.
* The [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Openmoko_Wiki_Official_Index_Page wiki index] is another static categorization. It is therefore out of date. Moreover, it seems strictly hierarchical, while actually pages should be described with multiple categories, and categories can have multiple parents.
* There should be a small number of a orthogonal category trees, each describing one consistent conceptual taxonomy.
* Ideally categories should not include language, if we don't do so the list of pages is cluttered.
* There should be only one category taxonomy for the "Neo type" with subcategories "FreeRunner", "Neo1973", "GTA03"... Otherwise, categories should not include the Neo type.
* Another big taxonomy can be based on the layers model. "Hardware", "Drivers", "Operating system", "Framework", "Applications", "Distributions". With many subcategories here.
* A taxonomy of technical level of expertise "General public", "Beginners", "Users", "Experts".
* A taxonomy by function or by subsystem: "Phone", "Wifi", "GPS/GPRS modem", "USB", "Bluetooth", "Accelerometers", "Audio", "Power", "SD card", "Serial bus", "Display", "Accessories", "Debug board"
* A taxonomy by maturity: "Wishlist", "Experimental", "Unstable", "Testing", "Stable".

===Lists now implemented as categories===

Rejected. (Will remove this section soon.)

===Too general category names===

These end up in mixed content. They could be removed and content migrated to more specific category names.

(1) We've moved Openmoko Inc related info from Openmoko to a new Openmoko Inc category. This was the original aim of the Openmoko category when it was created.

===The Category:ideas===
Problem 1:
Many pages have   Wishlist:   in the title. This syntax is potentially confusing because there is no Wishlist:  namespace. I suggest a mass rename from "Wishlist:(.*)" to "Wishlist/\1" ?

Problem 2:
A significant minority of pages in the "Category:ideas" are missing the prefix in the title.

Problem 3:
There are two templates, { { Wishlist } } and { { Unimplemented } } . Is that unnecessary redundancy, or is there a subtle distinction .

=== Category structure ===

Please see that below, because it was too long to include here.

== Navigation templates ==

(FYI Description moved to [[Openmoko_Wiki_Editing_Guidelines#Navigation_templates]], [[User:Kempelen|Kempelen]])

* The [[Distributions]] page feature a non-templated navigation box
* We should name these templates distinctly. I suggest using a prefix like "NavBox:".
* Visual design is by hand (not CSS), and not beautiful
* Need to test positioning at bottom of article.

=== References ===

[http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/documentation/2008-August/000405.html First discussion in the mailing list] (Note: in the middle of a thread about left navboxes)

* '''Yes votes''': [[User:Kempelen|Kempelen]] (For real wikipedia like navigation templates at the bottom, not at TOC position, we should move this section to editing guidelines as soon as template implementation improves a bit. Do not delete this please!)

== DolfjeBot1 proposals ==
Their is a bot on the openmoko wiki that's controlled by [[User:Dolfje]]. If you have tasks for the bot, please put them [[User:DolfjeBot1|here]].
A request has been made to tag DolfjeBot1 user account with the 'bot' flag. [[Special:Listusers/bureaucrat| Here is the lists of users]] with permissions at the necessary `bureaucrat' level.

==Wiki engine issues==
Can we please install/fix the following features for this wiki:
* '''Math''' - the Tex math markup does not work currently. Test:
** <math> z =\left (1-\left(\frac{P_{ind}}{101.325}\right)^{0.190263} \right ) \times \frac{87.828}{0.00198122} </math>
** <math> P_{ind} </math>
* [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi '''Syntax''' Highlighting - makes code much more readable]
* [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:GraphViz GraphViz] works with the commonly known dot language - it allows us to draw '''graphs''' using easy markup.
* [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:AnyWikiDraw AnyWikiDraw] allows us to draw svg '''diagrams''' directly on the wiki page.
* Make '''visited links''' a different color.

== Change Sitename ==

The name of this wiki is currently "Openmoko". I think it should be "Openmoko Wiki" for the following reasons:

* The other parts of this site (Planet, Projects, Docs) have similar names
* Media Wiki automatically creates a [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Namespace namespace] for the Sitename (currently "Openmoko"). This means that content of pages beginning with "Openmoko:" cannot be found through the normal search function of this wiki. (At the moment there are five pages of this kind: [[Openmoko:About]], [[Openmoko:Community Portal]], [[Openmoko:Current events]], [[Openmoko:Searching]], [[Openmoko:Privacy policy]])--[[User:Marko Knöbl|Marko Knöbl]] 18:33, 8 August 2008 (UTC)

'''Yes votes''': [[User:Marko Knöbl|Marko Knöbl]], [[User:MinhHaDuong|Minh]]

'''No votes''':

== Organize translations ==

I suggest moving the translations to sub-wikis, like the way wikipedia does it. Currently all translations show up in searches and under category-lists. --[[User:Johndoesacc|Johndoesacc]] 12:03, 25 August 2008 (UTC)


== Category structure discovering and planning ==

This is a discovery of the current category structure and notes about how it should be changed. Please contribute, add your comments what should be changed and how. Thanks, [[User:Kempelen|Kempelen]]

Applications category contains subcategories for various application groups, like GPS, Networking... This may be a problem if e.g. GPS belongs to Applications and Hardware too (and most of these stuff will belong to both). Maybe we could simply add articles to Applications AND GPS, which won't be subcategories of each other. [[User:Kempelen|Kempelen]] 20:54, 29 August 2008 (UTC)

Basic End User and Advanced End User categories have been created instead User, which was not enough specific term. (And contained only WishList items!) [[User:Kempelen|Kempelen]]

== Rejected requests ==

When a requested Wiki Issue is voted for not to be done, it must be moved here, to make sure it won't get continously requested again.

* '''Don't translate the wiki - rejected''' proposed by [[User:Minime|Minime]] August 2007, moved to rejected by [[User:Kempelen|Kempelen]] August 2008: the Documentation Team looks to support the idea.
* '''Use namespaces to separate user-oriented and developper-oriented content'''. Assuming the default namespace is user-oriented that would exclude developper-oriented pages from searches (unless the user ticks the box, but who does ?). And it can't be done purely in the wiki, it needs admin time. Better to use categories and a prefix in the page name (like BlendeWiki). [[:User:MinhHaDuong|MinhHaDuong]]
* '''Use category pages instead List Pages''' Good list pages are allowed and encouraged, as the documentation team today agreed on the mailing list. [[User:Kempelen|Kempelen]] 21:27, 30 August 2008 (UTC)
