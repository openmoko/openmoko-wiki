==Categories ==

===General issues with categories===
* Please read wikipedia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categorization Categorization] page and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:FAQ/Categorization FAQ]
* There are way too many [[Special:Categories| categories]].
* The [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Openmoko_Wiki_Categories_Index_Page categories index] is static and therefore out of date.
* The [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Openmoko_Wiki_Official_Index_Page wiki index] is another static categorization. It is therefore out of date. Moreover, it seems strictly hierarchical, while actually pages should be described with multiple categories, and categories can have multiple parents.
* There should be a small number of a orthogonal category trees, each describing one consistent conceptual taxonomy.
* Ideally categories should not include language, if we don't do so the list of pages is cluttered.
* There should be only one category taxonomy for the "Neo type" with subcategories "FreeRunner", "Neo1973", "GTA03"... Otherwise, categories should not include the Neo type.
* Another big taxonomy can be based on the layers model. "Hardware", "Drivers", "Operating system", "Framework", "Applications", "Distributions". With many subcategories here.
* A taxonomy of technical level of expertise "General public", "Beginners", "Users", "Experts".
* A taxonomy by function or by subsystem: "Phone", "Wifi", "GPS/GPRS modem", "USB", "Bluetooth", "Accelerometers", "Audio", "Power", "SD card", "Serial bus", "Display", "Accessories", "Debug board"
* A taxonomy by maturity: "Wishlist", "Experimental", "Unstable", "Testing", "Stable".

===Lists now implemented as categories===

These Pages are now implemented as categories, thus the unmaintaned pages could be removed. - Kempelen

|}

Note that as a matter of principle, lists and categories are two complementary ways to organize information. We should strive to have both excellent lists AND categories in the wiki.

===Too general category names===

These end up in mixed content. They could be removed and content migrated to more specific category names.

(1) We've moved Openmoko Inc related info from Openmoko to a new Openmoko Inc category. This was the original aim of the Openmoko category when it was created.

===The Category:ideas===
Problem 1:
Many pages have   Wishlist:   in the title. This syntax is potentially confusing because there is no Wishlist:  namespace. Should we suggest a mass rename from "Wishlist:(.*)" to "Ideas - \1" ? Or really create a  Wishlist:  namespace for vaporware ?

Problem 2:
A significant minority of pages in the "Category:ideas" are missing the prefix in the title.

Problem 3:
There are two templates, { { Wishlist } } and { { Unimplemented } } . Is that unnecessary redundancy, or is there a subtle distinction .

=== Category structure ===

{{Editing|Kempelen|2008/08/29|Discovering category structure}}

Names are votes. See also: Too general category names above.

Top level categories.

* [[:Category:Categories]] - container for top level categories.
** [[:Category:Community]]
** [[:Category:Documentation]] (Remove: [[User:Kempelen|Kempelen]])
** [[:Category:Hardware]]
** [[:Category:Information]] - (Remove: [[User:Kempelen|Kempelen]])
** [[:Category:Openmoko]] - (Remove: [[User:Kempelen|Kempelen]])
** [[:Category:Policy]] - Developer policies (OK: [[User:Kempelen|Kempelen]]) 
** [[:Category:Software]] - (OK: [[User:Kempelen|Kempelen]])
** [[:Category:Technical]] - (Remove: [[User:Kempelen|Kempelen]]) 
** [[:Category:ToDo]] - The TODO template adds here (OK: [[User:Kempelen|Kempelen]])
** [[:Category:User's Manual]] - 

Subcategories of Software. Looks well designed:

* [[:Category:Software]] - Articles should not be added here directly.
** [[:Category:Applications]] - (OK: [[User:Kempelen|Kempelen]])
** [[:Category:Distributions]] - (OK: [[User:Kempelen|Kempelen]])
** [[:Category:Software (non openmoko)]] - (OK: [[User:Kempelen|Kempelen]])

Applications category contains subcategories for various application groups, like GPS, Networking... This may be a problem if e.g. GPS belongs to Applications and Hardware too (and most of these stuff will belong to both). Maybe we could simply add articles to Applications AND GPS, which won't be subcategories of each other. [[User:Kempelen|Kempelen]] 20:54, 29 August 2008 (UTC)

Basic End User and Advanced End User categories may need to be created instead User, which is not enough specific term. [[User:Kempelen|Kempelen]]

== Navigation templates ==

Exemples: [[Template:Om_2008.8]], [[Template:OM2007.2]]

These are most useful to present small sets of chronological or otherwise 
well ordered information items. For example, it's obvious to offer navigation 
templates between these articles:
* Openmoko produced smartphones {GTA01 Neo 1973, GTA02 Neo FreeRunner, GTA 03 
(speculative)}
* Distributions {2007.1, 2007.2, 2008.8 ASU, 2008.9, FSO, SHR, Qtopia, Debian}

In effect navigation templates create a subset of important pages presented sequentially. This corresponds more or less to a chapter in the user manual. We should not force them where they cannot create a CONSISTENT  forth-and-back navigation between a GROUP OF PAGES.

=== Issues ===
* The [[Distributions]] page feature a non-templated navigation box
* We should name these templates distinctly. I suggest using a prefix like "NavBox:".
* Visual design is by hand (not CSS), and not beautiful
* Need to test positioning at bottom of article.

== DolfjeBot1 proposals ==
Their is a bot on the openmoko wiki that's controlled by [[User:Dolfje]]. If you have tasks for the bot, please put them [[User:DolfjeBot1|here]].

==Wiki engine issues==
Can we please install/fix the following features for this wiki:
* '''Math''' - the Tex math markup does not work currently. Test:
** <math> z =\left (1-\left(\frac{P_{ind}}{101.325}\right)^{0.190263} \right ) \times \frac{87.828}{0.00198122} </math>
** <math> P_{ind} </math>
* [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi '''Syntax''' Highlighting - makes code much more readable]
* [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:GraphViz GraphViz] works with the commonly known dot language - it allows us to draw '''graphs''' using easy markup.
* [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:AnyWikiDraw AnyWikiDraw] allows us to draw svg '''diagrams''' directly on the wiki page.
* Make '''visited links''' a different color.

== Change Sitename ==

The name of this wiki is currently "Openmoko". I think it should be "Openmoko Wiki" for the following reasons:

* The other parts of this site (Planet, Projects, Docs) have similar names
* Media Wiki automatically creates a [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Namespace namespace] for the Sitename (currently "Openmoko"). This means that content of pages beginning with "Openmoko:" cannot be found through the normal search function of this wiki. (At the moment there are six pages of this kind: [[Openmoko:About]], [[Openmoko:Community Portal]], [[Openmoko:Current events]], [[Openmoko:Searching]], [[Openmoko:Current events/it]], [[Openmoko:Privacy policy]])--[[User:Marko Knöbl|Marko Knöbl]] 18:33, 8 August 2008 (UTC)

'''Yes votes''': [[User:Marko Knöbl|Marko Knöbl]], [[User:MinhHaDuong|Minh]]

'''No votes''':

== Organize translations ==

I suggest moving the translations to sub-wikis, like the way wikipedia does it. Currently all translations show up in searches and under category-lists. --[[User:Johndoesacc|Johndoesacc]] 12:03, 25 August 2008 (UTC)


== Rejected requests ==

When a requested Wiki Issue is voted for not to be done, it must be moved here, to make sure it won't get continously requested again.

* '''Don't translate the wiki - rejected''' proposed by [[User:Minime|Minime]] August 2007, moved to rejected by [[User:Kempelen|Kempelen]] August 2008: the Documentation Team looks to support the idea.
* '''Use namespaces to separate user-oriented and developper-oriented content'''. Assuming the default namespace is user-oriented that would exclude developper-oriented pages from searches (unless the user ticks the box, but who does ?). And it can't be done purely in the wiki, it needs admin time. Better to use categories and a prefix in the page name (like BlendeWiki). [[:User:MinhHaDuong|MinhHaDuong]]
