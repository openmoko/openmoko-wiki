If you think something is wrong with a Wiki page or with this Wiki in general, please add your thoughts to this list. You may just want to read existing proposals and put your vote on them, [[Wiki Maintainers]] will appreciate.

When adding an issue please 

* Provide a reason
* Provide your name as vote for the action to be taken (you can automatically enter your username by typing "<nowiki>~~~</nowiki>")

Accepted and implemented requests should be deleted. Rejected requests should be moved to the bottom of the page to avoid requesting them again.

==Wiki Pages==
===Pages capable of development===
* [[OpenMoko:Community Portal]]
* [[Documentation]]
* [[AGPSD]] (Needs new GPS info)
* [[AR6K]] (Needs more info)

===Redundant Pages===
* There are several pages concerning OpenMoko compatible service providers:
** [[Carriers]], most up-to-date, confirmed service providers.
*** [[Carriers/ATT]]
*** [[Carriers/TMobile]]
*** [[Carriers/Fido]]
*** [[Carriers/Rogers]]
** [[OpenMoko compatible cellphone providers]]
** [[Neo1973 compatible cellphone providers]]

*I suggest merging the editing help pages:
**[[Help:Editing]]
**[[Editing wiki]]
**[[Edit Wiki]]

===Tidy up===
* [[Wishlist:Text Input]] - tidy up/sort, give short feedback to each method
* [[Booting_from_SD]] - tidy up and a rewrite

===Categories ===

These Pages are now implemented as categories, thus the unmaintaned pages could be removed. - Kempelen
* [[Advanced_End-user]]: use [[:Category:User]] instead
* [[Basic_End-user]]: use [[:Category:User]] instead
* [[System_Developer]]: use [[:Category:System_Developers]] instead
* [[Application_Developer]]: use [[:Category:Application_Developer]] instead

===Too general category names===

These end up in mixed content. They could be removed and content migrated to more specific category names.

(1) We've moved Openmoko Inc related info from Openmoko to a new Openmoko Inc category. This was the original aim of the Openmoko category when it was created.

==Wiki engine issues==
Can we please install/fix the following features for this wiki:
* '''Math''' - the Tex math markup does not work currently. Test:
** <math> z =\left (1-\left(\frac{P_{ind}}{101.325}\right)^{0.190263} \right ) \times \frac{87.828}{0.00198122} </math>
** <math> P_{ind} </math>
* [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi '''Syntax''' Highlighting - makes code much more readable]
* [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:GraphViz GraphViz] works with the commonly known dot language - it allows us to draw '''graphs''' using easy markup.
* [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:AnyWikiDraw AnyWikiDraw] allows us to draw svg '''diagrams''' directly on the wiki page.
* Make '''visited links''' a different color.

== Change Sitename ==

The name of this wiki is currently "Openmoko". I think it should be "Openmoko Wiki" for the following reasons:

* The other parts of this site (Planet, Projects, Docs) have similar names
* Media Wiki automatically creates a [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Namespace namespace] for the Sitename (currently "Openmoko"). This means that content of pages beginning with "Openmoko:" cannot be found through the normal search function of this wiki. (At the moment there are six pages of this kind: [[Openmoko:About]], [[Openmoko:Community Portal]], [[Openmoko:Current events]], [[Openmoko:Searching]], [[Openmoko:Current events/it]], [[Openmoko:Privacy policy]])--[[User:Marko Knöbl|Marko Knöbl]] 18:33, 8 August 2008 (UTC)

'''Yes votes''': [[User:Marko Knöbl|Marko Knöbl]]

'''No votes''':

== Rejected requests ==

When a requested Wiki Issue is voted for not to be done, it must be moved here, to make sure it won't get continously requested again.

* '''Don't translate the wiki - rejected''' proposed by [[User:Minime|Minime]] August 2007, moved to rejected by [[User:Kempelen|Kempelen]] August 2008: the Documentation Team looks to support the idea.
