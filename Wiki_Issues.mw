==Wiki Pages==
===Pages capable of development===
* [[OpenMoko:Community Portal]]
* [[Documentation]]

===Redundant Pages===
* There are several pages concerning OpenMoko compatible service providers:
** [[Carriers]], most up-to-date, confirmed service providers.
*** [[Carriers/ATT]]
*** [[Carriers/TMobile]]
*** [[Carriers/Fido]]
*** [[Carriers/Rogers]]
** [[OpenMoko compatible cellphone providers]]
** [[Neo1973 compatible cellphone providers]]

* There are several pages concerning the Neo-iPhone comparison:
** [[IPhone]]
** [[IPhone (GTA01)]]

* <s>There are two pages concerning events</s> '''DONE'''
** [[Current events]]
** <s>[[Community Events]]</s>
** [[Community Events/it]]

===Tidy up===
* [[Wishlist:Text Input]] - tidy up/sort, give short feedback to each method

==Wiki Mods==
Can we please install/fix the following features for this wiki:
* '''Math''' - the Tex math markup does not work currently.
* Sortable tables do not work [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Sorting http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Sorting]
* [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi '''Syntax''' Highlighting - makes code much more readable]
* [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:GraphViz GraphViz] works with the commonly known dot language - it allows us to draw '''graphs''' using easy markup.
* [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:AnyWikiDraw AnyWikiDraw] allows us to draw svg '''diagrams''' directly on the wiki page.

==Wiki languages==
Translating ''this'' wiki into other languages does not make much sense:
* All translated pages need to be kept up-to-date. The people translating will not see every change made.
* A partly (and often quite badly) done translation is no good.
* People who use this wiki are sophisticated users, they are very likely to know English. They will not use localised pages as they do not trust them in matters of being up-to-date.
* Rather create another wiki/information page with more static information for regular mass-market purchaser that do not care about 20 ways to connect their OpenMoko device with their PC but just about one easy one.
