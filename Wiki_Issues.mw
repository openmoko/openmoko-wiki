==Wiki Pages==
===Pages capable of development===
* [[Openmoko:Community Portal]]
* [[Documentation]]
* [[AGPSD]] (Needs new GPS info)
* [[AR6K]] (Needs more info)
* [[GTA02 partitions]]: seems to be about the GTA01; could someone with a GTA02 please correct the partition sizes and names?
* [[Advanced_End-user]], [[Basic_End-user]], [[System_Developer]], [[Application_Developer]]: These are not up to the standard we set for List Pages on [[Openmoko_Wiki_Editing_Guidelines#List_pages]] [[User:Kempelen|Kempelen]]

===Redundant Pages===
* There are several pages concerning Openmoko compatible service providers:
** [[Carriers]], most up-to-date, confirmed service providers.
*** [[Carriers/ATT]]
*** [[Carriers/TMobile]]
*** [[Carriers/Fido]]
*** [[Carriers/Rogers]]
** [[Neo1973 compatible cellphone providers]]

*I suggest merging the editing help pages:
**[[Help:Editing]]
**[[Edit Wiki]]

*pages about GPS:
**[[Hardware:AGPS]]
**[[Gpsd]]
**[[Neo 1973 GPS]]
**[[Neo FreeRunner GPS]]

*applications:
**[[Available Packages]]
**[[Applications]]

===Tidy up===
* [[Wishlist:Text Input]] - tidy up/sort, give short feedback to each method
* [[Booting_from_SD]] - tidy up and a rewrite

=== Pages proposed for deletion ===

'''Please help cleaning these''': Check if there is a red (nonexisting) link in this table, click it, click "What links here" in the toolbox and '''update the broken links'''. When done, remove the deleted entry from this table.

== Categories ==

{{Main|:Category talk:Categories}}

== CSS ==

We have discussed design on the mailing list, with the conclusion that revising was not a big priority. However, the wiki should be skinnable from user-space by editing : http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/MediaWiki:Common.css . And for development, each user can have his/her own CSS to eat his own dogfood. But I can't seem to make this feature work here.

== Navigation templates ==

(FYI Description moved to [[Openmoko_Wiki_Editing_Guidelines#Navigation_templates]], [[User:Kempelen|Kempelen]])

* The [[Distributions]] page feature a non-templated navigation box
* We should name these templates distinctly. I suggest using a prefix like "NavBox:".
* Visual design is by hand (not CSS), and not beautiful
* Need to test positioning at bottom of article.

[http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/documentation/2008-August/000405.html First discussion in the mailing list] (Note: in the middle of a thread about left navboxes)

* '''Yes votes''': [[User:Kempelen|Kempelen]] (For real wikipedia like navigation templates at the bottom, not at TOC position, we should move this section to editing guidelines as soon as template implementation improves a bit. Do not delete this please!)

== DolfjeBot1 proposals ==
Their is a bot on the openmoko wiki that's controlled by [[User:Dolfje]]. If you have tasks for the bot, please put them [[User:DolfjeBot1|here]].
A request has been made to tag DolfjeBot1 user account with the 'bot' flag. [[Special:Listusers/bureaucrat| Here is the lists of users]] with permissions at the necessary `bureaucrat' level.

==Wiki engine issues==
Can we please install/fix the following features for this wiki:
* '''Math''' - the Tex math markup does not work currently. Test:
** <math> z =\left (1-\left(\frac{P_{ind}}{101.325}\right)^{0.190263} \right ) \times \frac{87.828}{0.00198122} </math>
** <math> P_{ind} </math>
* [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi '''Syntax''' Highlighting - makes code much more readable]
* [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:GraphViz GraphViz] works with the commonly known dot language - it allows us to draw '''graphs''' using easy markup.
* [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:AnyWikiDraw AnyWikiDraw] allows us to draw svg '''diagrams''' directly on the wiki page.
* Make '''visited links''' a different color.

== Change Sitename ==

The name of this wiki is currently "Openmoko". I think it should be "Openmoko Wiki" for the following reasons:

* The other parts of this site (Planet, Projects, Docs) have similar names
* Media Wiki automatically creates a [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Namespace namespace] for the Sitename (currently "Openmoko"). This means that content of pages beginning with "Openmoko:" cannot be found through the normal search function of this wiki. (At the moment there are five pages of this kind: [[Openmoko:About]], [[Openmoko:Community Portal]], [[Openmoko:Current events]], [[Openmoko:Searching]], [[Openmoko:Privacy policy]])--[[User:Marko Knöbl|Marko Knöbl]] 18:33, 8 August 2008 (UTC)

'''Yes votes''': [[User:Marko Knöbl|Marko Knöbl]], [[User:MinhHaDuong|Minh]]

'''No votes''':

::OpenmokoIT still do some research now. [[User:Coolcat|coolcat]]

== Organize translations ==

I suggest moving the translations to sub-wikis, like the way wikipedia does it. Currently all translations show up in searches and under category-lists. --[[User:Johndoesacc|Johndoesacc]] 12:03, 25 August 2008 (UTC)

+1. See issues and solutions for a multilingual mediawiki at: 
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Multilingual_MediaWiki
Also, the correspondence between translation should be maintained with tags:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Interlanguage_links
The request [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/documentation/2008-September/000557.html has been heard] but maybe not in the right places. What is the best operational frequency to ping the hosting engineers for that ? [[User:MinhHaDuong|MinhHaDuong]] 13:02, 10 September 2008 (UTC)

== Rejected requests ==

When a requested Wiki Issue is voted for not to be done, it must be moved here, to make sure it won't get continously requested again.

* '''Don't translate the wiki - rejected''' proposed by [[User:Minime|Minime]] August 2007, moved to rejected by [[User:Kempelen|Kempelen]] August 2008: the Documentation Team looks to support the idea.
* '''Use namespaces to separate user-oriented and developper-oriented content'''. Assuming the default namespace is user-oriented that would exclude developper-oriented pages from searches (unless the user ticks the box, but who does ?). And it can't be done purely in the wiki, it needs admin time. Better to use categories and a prefix in the page name (like BlendeWiki). [[:User:MinhHaDuong|MinhHaDuong]]
* '''Use category pages instead List Pages''' Good list pages are allowed and encouraged, as the documentation team today agreed on the mailing list. [[User:Kempelen|Kempelen]] 21:27, 30 August 2008 (UTC)
