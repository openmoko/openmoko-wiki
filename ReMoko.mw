==About==

* Openmoko remote controller is a SoC 08 project, that aims to write a application that can make Openmoko-powered devices appear to be a mixed Bluetooth keyboard-and-mouse device.

==Remoko v0.2==

===Features===
*'''Connection'''
** Connection to the majority of the bluetooth stacks;
** Connection status daemon (possibility to connected to the remote device when the connection are closed);
** Information about the remote device;
*'''Mouse Profile'''
** 3 button's mouse;
** Left button mouse holding (for drawing for example);
** Tapping functionality, like a touchpad;
** Vertical Scroll - Beta;

===Known Bugs===

===Tested Bluetooth Stacks ===

==Ideas for the application name==

*MokoRemote
*BlueRemote
*<font color="#00FF00">ReMoko</font> or ReMoto (maybe some character that's a combination of t and k, at least in the splash/logo)
*Mokomote
*Mokomo (shorter)
*FreeMote (Builds on freerunner and remote) -- +1 vote
*MokoKeyMouse (It can be a bit too long, so you can make it shorter as: MKM)

==Wish List==
* Possibility to control presentations easily (few buttons, PG-UP, PG-DOWN for example) - <font color="#FF9900">In progress</font>
** maybe even navigation via gestures
** possibly use the touchscreen similar to a touchpad (mouse) - <font color="#00FF00">Done</font>
*** maybe it is too much, but if you manage to make the touchpad, you could get a small screenshot of the big screen (it is useful for presentations if you want to draw/write something without quality).
* ideally generic GUI that loads controls from some xml config file to make it fully customizable for different purposes (media remote, presenter stick, ...)
* Connect as a Bluetooth remote to a Sony Playstation 3 for Bluray/DVD playback. (JReese)
* Make use of profiles to change the interface easy and fast (interface for mouse, keyboard, a mix of those two, presentations, remote controller for videos and music, ...) - <font color="#FF9900">In progress</font>
* Top part of screen as touch-pad, row of three mouse buttons across middle and whichever keyboard the user usually uses on the phone popped-up at the bottom as when adding text in any other app. - <font color="#FF9900">In progress</font>
* A MythTV remote would be handy, just a subset of a BT keyboard for common commands with a few nice icons rather than letters on (large) keys.
* Avahi search for HTTP services labeled say "remote" via ethernet (BT/LAN or Wifi). MythTV/Elisa and OOPresentation can develop their own html/flash/javascript/etc. "remotes" to hearts content without fine-grain syncing every change of code/GUI/API with your "OpenMoko Remote App". Avahi/HTTP also lets desktop/laptop browsers to control "remotes"; this means a bigger community.

==Roadmap==

* 1- Write a HID BlueZ driver that can enable the Openmoko to be seen as a mixed keyboard and mouse in the three major OS's. - <font color="#00FF00">Done</font>
* 2- Map keys and mouse gestures to the USB HID usage tables. - <font color="#00FF00">Done</font>
* 3- Write the UI and some other features. - <font color="#FF9900">In progress</font>
