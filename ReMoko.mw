*'''Add your idea here'''

==Ideas for the application logo==

* '''Add your idea here'''

==Wish List==
* Possibility to controll presentations easily (few buttons, PG-UP, PG-DOWN for example)
** maybe even navigation via gestures
** possibly use the touchscreen similar to a touchpad (mouse)
* ideally generic GUI thatloads controlsfrom some xml config file to make it fully customizable for different purposes (media remote, presenter stick, ...)
* '''Add your wish here'''

==Roadmap==

* 1- Write a HID BlueZ driver that can enable the OpenMoko to be seen as a mixed keyboard and mouse in the three major OS's.
* 2- Map keys and mouse gestures to the USB HID usage tables
* 3- Start write UI and some nice other things

==About==

* OpenMoko remote controller is a SoC 08 project, that aims to write a application that can turn OpenMoko powered devices in a Bluetooth mixed keyboard and mouse.
