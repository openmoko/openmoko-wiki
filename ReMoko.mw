==About==

* OpenMoko remote controller is a SoC 08 project, that aims to write a application that can make OpenMoko-powered devices appear to be a mixed Bluetooth keyboard-and-mouse device.
*'''Student:''' [http://www.valeriovalerio.org Valério Valério]
*'''Mentor:''' Daniel Willmann

==Ideas for the application name==

*MokoRemote
*BlueRemote
*ReMoko or ReMoto (maybe some character that's a combination of t and k, at least in the splash/logo)

==Ideas for the application logo==

* '''Add your idea here'''

==Wish List==
* Possibility to controll presentations easily (few buttons, PG-UP, PG-DOWN for example)
** maybe even navigation via gestures
** possibly use the touchscreen similar to a touchpad (mouse)
* ideally generic GUI that loads controls from some xml config file to make it fully customizable for different purposes (media remote, presenter stick, ...)
* Connect as a Bluetooth remote to a Sony Playstation 3 for Bluray/DVD playback. (JReese)

==Roadmap==

* 1- Write a HID BlueZ driver that can enable the OpenMoko to be seen as a mixed keyboard and mouse in the three major OS's.
* 2- Map keys and mouse gestures to the USB HID usage tables
* 3- Start write UI and some nice other things
