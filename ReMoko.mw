==About==

* Openmoko remote controller is a SoC 08 project, that aims to write a application that can make Openmoko-powered devices appear to be a mixed Bluetooth keyboard-and-mouse device.

==ReMoko v0.1==

===Install Instructions===

*'''Pre-requisites'''
** Remoko depends on the Openmoko framework;
** The FSO images built before 20080807 have a bug in the framework bluetooth system, to use remoko in a older FSO image you will need to change the lines below in '/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/framework/subsystems/ousaged/generic.py':

***98
****-        proxy = self.bus.get_object( "org.freesmartphone.Device", "/org/freesmartphone/Device/PowerControl/" + self.name )
****+        proxy = self.bus.get_object( "org.freesmartphone.odeviced", "/org/freesmartphone/Device/PowerControl/" + self.name )

***209
****-    genericUsageControl.addResource( DummyResource( genericUsageControl, "Bluetooth" ) )
****+    genericUsageControl.addResource( ODeviceDResource( genericUsageControl, "Bluetooth" ) )

after that you will need to restart the framework (kill the process and start it again or simply restart the device).

===Usage===

* Linux
** Start the remoko app in the neo;
** In a shell type 'hidd --connect <neo_bt_addr>' (need root privileges) or use a user interface to choose the neo as a bluetooth keyboard;

* Windows XP and Media Center Edition
** Start the remoko app in the neo;
** Go to the bluetooth preferences and choose 'Add a new device';
** Choose the neo (default name is  'BlueZ (0)') and choose 'no password';

===Features===
*'''Connection'''
** Connection to the majority of the bluetooth stacks;
** Connection status daemon (possibility to connect to the remote device when the connection are closed);
** Information about the remote device;
*'''Mouse Profile'''
** 3 button's mouse;
** Left button mouse holding (for drawing for example);
** Tapping functionality, like a touchpad;
** Vertical Scroll;
*'''Keyboard Profile'''
** Full qwerty keyboard;
** Numeric keyboard;
** Holding for Capslock, Shift, Control, Alt and Control + Alt;
** Mouse area with tapping functionality;

===Known Bugs===
* The 'backslash' key is wrong mapped;
* In illume keyboard in the FSO milestone 2 have some bug yet in the default profile and in the numbers profile;
* Connection problems with Symbian S60 devices with BT-HID keyboard app provided by Nokia;

===Tested Bluetooth Stacks ===
*'''Working'''
** Linux BlueZ Stack
** Windows XP SP2
** Windows Media Center Edition (Toshiba Bluetooth Stack)

*'''Not Working'''
** Symbian Nokia's S60 - tested with Nokia Navigator (probably a BlueZ SDP bug)

===TODO===
* Presentation profile;
* Multimedia profile;
* Games profile;
* Accelerometer profile:

===Need help in:===
* Application logo (Tag name: ReMoko);
* Set of menu icon related to the neo (Icons in use are form the GTK+ project, enlightenment project and [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/User:Nenadgrujicic Nenadgrujicic]. ReMoko icon made by [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/User:Fradeve11 Fradeve11])

==Ideas for the application name==

*MokoRemote
*BlueRemote
*<font color="#00FF00">ReMoko</font> or ReMoto (maybe some character that's a combination of t and k, at least in the splash/logo)
*Mokomote
*Mokomo (shorter)
*FreeMote (Builds on freerunner and remote) -- +1 vote
*MokoKeyMouse (It can be a bit too long, so you can make it shorter as: MKM)

==Ideas for the application logo==

* '''Add your idea here'''

==Wish List==
* Possibility to control presentations easily (few buttons, PG-UP, PG-DOWN for example) - <font color="#FF9900">In progress</font>
** maybe even navigation via gestures
** possibly use the touchscreen similar to a touchpad (mouse) - <font color="#00FF00">Done</font>
*** maybe it is too much, but if you manage to make the touchpad, you could get a small screenshot of the big screen (it is useful for presentations if you want to draw/write something without quality).
* ideally generic GUI that loads controls from some xml config file to make it fully customizable for different purposes (media remote, presenter stick, ...)
* Connect as a Bluetooth remote to a Sony Playstation 3 for Bluray/DVD playback. (JReese)
* Make use of profiles to change the interface easy and fast (interface for mouse, keyboard, a mix of those two, presentations, remote controller for videos and music, ...) - <font color="#FF9900">In progress</font>
* Top part of screen as touch-pad, row of three mouse buttons across middle and whichever keyboard the user usually uses on the phone popped-up at the bottom as when adding text in any other app. - <font color="#FF9900">In progress</font>
* A MythTV remote would be handy, just a subset of a BT keyboard for common commands with a few nice icons rather than letters on (large) keys.
* Avahi search for HTTP services labeled say "remote" via ethernet (BT/LAN or Wifi). MythTV/Elisa and OOPresentation can develop their own html/flash/javascript/etc. "remotes" to hearts content without fine-grain syncing every change of code/GUI/API with your "OpenMoko Remote App". Avahi/HTTP also lets desktop/laptop browsers to control "remotes"; this means a bigger community.
* '''Add your wish here'''

==Roadmap==

* 1- Write a HID BlueZ driver that can enable the Openmoko to be seen as a mixed keyboard and mouse in the three major OS's. - <font color="#00FF00">Done</font>
* 2- Map keys and mouse gestures to the USB HID usage tables. - <font color="#00FF00">Done</font>
* 3- Write the UI and some other features. - <font color="#FF9900">In progress</font>
