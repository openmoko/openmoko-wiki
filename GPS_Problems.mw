See [[GPS]] for details on how to evaluate the Freerunner GPS with cat.

Before reporting a problem here, please check that you've had the GPS out in the open air, preferably with the GPS antenna pointed up, for over 15 mins. (the screen the right way up)

This should get a lock in even the worst cases.

Also note if you've tried unpluging and repluging the internal GPS connector.
