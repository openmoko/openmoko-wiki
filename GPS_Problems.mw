|+Problems I'm having with the GPS
!Username||Checked outside?||External antenna?||Note

|Pthorin ||Yes|| No ||I tried for about 40 minutes outside, I'm running om-gta02 P1-Snapshot-20080622. Did get GPS time outside, but only got lines like: 
$GPGSA,A,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,99.99,99.99,99.99*30

--[[User:Pthorin|Pthorin]] 05:11, 11 July 2008 (UTC) I tried it out once again after removing the front cover and got a fix quite fast, less than five minutes. Could there be an issue with the case blocking the signals? Could the snap/latch above the antenna be a problem?

|iandouglas ||Yes|| No ||Spent over a half hour outdoors, the NMEA port on my Samsung Blackjack 2 found my position just fine, but also got the same 99.99,99.99,99.99*30 line as Pthorin when powering on the GPS unit, starting gpsd, then running gpspipe at the command line

=== Solved problems ===

''Let's collect hints which could solve the above problems here. E.g.: How to get the best results with your internal antenna''

* Before reporting a problem here, please check that you've had the GPS out in the open air, preferably with the GPS antenna pointed up, for over 15 mins. (the screen the right way up). This should get a lock in even the worst cases.

* Also note if you've tried unpluging and repluging the internal GPS connector. (See [[Disassembling_Neo1973]] about 2/3 of the way down.  (this may differ on freerunner, pictures appreciated)

[[FreeRunner_GPS_antenna_repair_SOP]] Indicates that the problem may be bad soldering, and includes a guide to fix. This will presumably void your warranty.
