See [[GPS]] for details on how to evaluate the Freerunner GPS with cat.

Before reporting a problem here, please check that you've had the GPS out in the open air, preferably with the GPS antenna pointed up, for over 15 mins.

This should get a lock in even the worst cases.

Also note if you've tried unpluging and repluging the internal GPS connector.
