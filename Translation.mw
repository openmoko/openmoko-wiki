Let us spread the popularity of OpenMoko/Neo1973 by
- localization of the software
- translation of documentation

Just as an overview who is able and willing to translate parts into other languages,
please join and add your Language and name. The source for the translation will
be English. When you have good English skills - you could contribute by correct
the sources :)

A good point to start would be to continuous translating of 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMoko into more languages on the other language sites of wikipedia.

"...it is easy to join and spend some minutes for translating,
and when someone finds some mistakes in any languages don't
blame the translator - just be productive and fix it yourself!" -[[User:RobertMichel|Robert Michel]]
