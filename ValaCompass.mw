== Description ==
ValaCompass is a 3D compass application for the 3D compass included in the [[Freerunner Navigation Board]] and [[Freerunner Navigation Board v2]] written in Vala and using GTK and Cairo. It uses the LIS302DL accelerometers of the GTA02 to display the North direction in a 3-dimensional way. Thus, no matter in which direction you hold your Freerunner, vala compass will show you where the North is.

== Usage ==

ValaCompass works with the hmc5843 kernel module provided by [[User:Cmair]] and available at [http://gitorious.org/freerunner-navigation-board http://gitorious.org/freerunner-navigation-board].

===Calibration phase===
After starting the valacompass executable, rotate your freerunner in all possible directions for about 5 seconds. After it, keep the device in one position for 3-4 seconds and wait for a stable direction information :).


== Current Issues ==
* Electrical interferences heaviliy influence the accuracy of the compass (e.g. TVs). Therefore, be careful when you calibrate your compass.
* The compass is not quite responsive. This may be due to the accelerometer kernel driver. I am going to investigate that as soon as possible.
* The redrawing mechanism is not the fastest as well. If I will have spare time, I will try to rewrite the application with the efl libs.

== Download ==
ValaCompass is currently at version 0.11.

ValaCompass uses libsensmon library provided by the [[SensMon]] project. Thus, you can find the sources for this library at [http://gitourious.org/sensor-monitor http://gitorious.org/sensor-monitor].

The ValaCompass sources are available at [http://gitorious.org/vala-compass http://gitorious.org/vala-compass].

For SHR-core and SHR-unstable corresponding packages are available.
