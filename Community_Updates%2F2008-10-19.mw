Hello all, welcome to Openmoko Community October 19th newsletter. The big news this time are [[opkg.org]] and the new Openmoko engineering team focusing back to the basics on [[Improving user experience]].

= Images =

Things were rather quiet on the distribution front. Rasterman's [http://download.enlightenment.org/misc/Illume/Freerunner/2008-10-12/ October 11th images] ([http://trac.enlightenment.org/e/browser/trunk/TMP/oe source]) were put online. This is not really a distribution, but rather a demonstration that illume runs well and is so beautiful, for others distros to grab. We also saw [http://shr.bearstech.com/ daily SHR image builds] online, no release yet but available for testing. And [[Qi]], the next bootloader, recently got resume support.[http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-October/033109.html Testing] shows that it is much faster than uboot indeed, but no release yet.

= Applications =

Everybody applauded when Tobias announced  http://opkg.org  , an online directory of applications (think Freshmeat, Tucows...). The database is community-driven, everybody can register and index applications. In the flow of community developped utilities, I noticed:
* the initial release of [http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~taw27/openmoko/openmoocow/ OpenMooCow], a nice, funny and useless bovine noise simulator.
* Optimizations on [[Rotate]]. This is an interesting example of competition and cooperation, because there are several versions being developed in parallel, with ideas jumping across all the time.
* The Gestures GSoC project developper managed to convince his academic instructors to let him code on the FreeRunner for his degree. Future developments coming at http://AccelSense.org
* [[Auxlaunch]] is a very simple, finger-friendly application launcher and window switcher for the Freerunner. It appears when the "AUX" button is pressed.

With respect to porting other applications to our favorite platform, I read that [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-October/033103.html powertop] actually runs on the FreeRunner. For your information, this is an utility that allows to measure and therefore optimize power usage. Also:
* [[FBReader]] an e-book reader programme now available for Debian and 2008.8
* Sander ported [[Sander|Pingus]] the free lemmings clone, for OE based distributions (it was already available on Debian).
* In addition to minimo, openmoko-browser2, and midori, we had a bunch of light and fast web browsers announced on the mailing list: [[http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/feeds/2008/ipk/glibc/armv4t/base/ Fennec]]), [[http://www.dillo.org/ Dillo]] ([[http://misc.andi.de1.cc/dillo/dillo_2.0-r0_armv4t.ipk ipk]]), [http://www.netsurf-browser.org/ NetSurf] and links2. That makes about seven, working more or less well. Choice, choice, choice...

= Hot bugs and most discussed issues =
* Wifi
* Digital Audio Playing
* Kernels currently has the APM power management interface is still compiled. This has been deprecated for years and must go away, preferably sooner than later. Hopefully ''apm -s'' should still work for suspend, or do we need something else ?
* Powersaving patches landed in stable-2.6.26 on October 8th. Note to application developpers: the best way to [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/openmoko-kernel/2008-October/005542.html blank the screen] to conserve power is the fbdev-ioctl method. I think that ''xset s 5'' should do it. Thanks to the HaralDd and the Swisscom research project !
* There is a workaround to the [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1024 GSM keeps reregistering bug], a.k.a. [http://moko.mwester.net/brc.html bouncing Calypso issue]: prevent the model from entering deep sleep.
* Unstable development of OM is moving back to OE.
* [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/devel/2008-October/002688.html Test reports]
* Fix [https://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/2038 Qtopia USSD] requests, so one can dial "*123" or "#4".
* OM announced two hires: Ray Chao, to work full-time in Taipei on the infrastructure, and Christopher Hall, a very experienced software engineer.

= Community =
* Openmoko's engineering team met for a 3 weeks workshop in Taipei, they decided to focus back on the basics, that is to leave the Installer, Locations, Diversity and Settings applications alone for a while. Then there was a long 

* The [http://planet.openmoko.org planet] got long, detailed informative posts, such as the [http://risto.kurppa.fi/blog/discussion-13-openmoko-community-feelings/ wrap-up of the "Lost  community" thread]. When someone makes a request on the mailing list, it is a mark of good netizenship to summarize the answers on one's blog like this (or on the wiki).
* There were discussions on what would be the job description of a community manager and decisions on lowering barriers to participation (i.e. access to write priviledges in code repositories) happened.
* An interesting stylus alternative was documented using [[Pouch a guitar pick]] attached to the pouch lanyard.

= Outside Openmoko =

* Linux [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-October/033087.html  2.6.27] released.
* Pulseaudio released [http://pulseaudio.org/milestone/0.9.13 version 0.9.13] with experimental support for Bluetooth devices.
