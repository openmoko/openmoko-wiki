'''Pexpect''' is a pure Python module for spawning child applications; controlling them; and responding to expected patterns in their output. Pexpect allows your script to spawn a child application and control it as if a human were typing commands. [[Pexpect]] can be used for automating interactive applications such as ssh, ftp, passwd, telnet, etc. It can be used to a automate setup scripts for duplicating software package installations on different servers. It can be used for automated software testing. The Pexpect interface was designed to be easy to use.


==Download==
Download [http://sourceforge.net/projects/pexpect/ the current version]  from sourceforge site.

===installing pexpect===
# download pexpect-2.1.tar.gz
# tar zxf pexpect-2.1.tar.gz
# cd pexpect-2.1
# python setup.py install do this as root

===example===
Under the pexpect-2.1 directory you should find the examples directory. This is the best way to learn to use Pexpect. See the descriptions of [http://pexpect.sourceforge.net/examples.html Pexpect Examples].

===API document===
* [http://pexpect.sourceforge.net/pexpect.html pexpect] This is the main module that you want.
* [http://pexpect.sourceforge.net/pxssh.html pxssh] Pexpect SSH is an extension of 'pexpect.spawn' that specializes in SSH.

the following are experimental extensions to Pexpect

* [http://pexpect.sourceforge.net/fdpexpect.html fdpexpect] fdpexpect extension of 'pexpect.spawn' that uses an open file descriptor.
* [http://pexpect.sourceforge.net/screen.html SCREEN] This represents a virtual 'screen'.
* [http://pexpect.sourceforge.net/ANSI.html ANSI] This parses ANSI/VT-100 terminal escape codes.
* [http://pexpect.sourceforge.net/FSM.html FSM] This is a finite state machine used by ANSI.

==How to use in neo==

===build package===
Download [[BitBake recipe]] from [http://www.openembedded.org/repo/org.openembedded.dev/packages/python/python-pexpect_2.1.bb here]. Using [[MokoMakefile]] tool train:

* copy this bitbake recipe to python package folder
 cp python-pexpect_2.1.bb $OMDIR/openembedded/packages/python
* use bitbake to build pexpect
 bitbake python-pexpect
* it generates the package files to this folder
 $OMDIR/build/tmp/deploy/glibc/ipk/armv4tpython-pexpect_2.1-r0_armv4t.ipk

===installing===
Using SCP to upload the ipk file to neo

* install pexpect to card memory, reference from [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Ipkg#Installing_Packages_to_the_Memory_Card here]
 ipkg install -d card armv4tpython-pexpect_2.1-r0_armv4t.ipk

* solve the PYTHON path problem
 ipkg files python-pexpect
 ipkg files python-io
 export PYTHONPATH="/media/card/ipkg/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/: \
 /media/card/ipkg/usr/lib/python2.5/lib-dynload/:/media/card/ipkg/usr/lib/python2.5/"

* verify the pexpect module
 python -c "import pexpect"

* some examples: 
 child = pexpect.spawn('libgsmd-tool -m shell')
 child.sendline('O')
 child.expect(['Power-On','ERROR','OK'])

{{note| we may consider to use pexpect to do some auto tests for GSM functions  }}
