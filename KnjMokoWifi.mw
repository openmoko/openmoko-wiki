The newest version is stable and useable. It supports no-encryption, WEP Key, WEP String and WPA through wpa-supplicant. It works be generating working configs for wpa-supplicant and executing commands like udhcp (the DHCP-tool on the OpenMoko), iwconfig and such.

Further more it supports profiles, where you can save essid's and key's, so you dont have to enter all that stuff over and over.
