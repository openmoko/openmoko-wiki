''Note: This is the (ongoing) description of the new framework architecture. See [[OpenmokoOldFramework]] for the framework architecture of 2007.1 and 2007.2''

=Purposes=

* '''Give people the infrastructure to create solid and exciting software products based on the Openmoko platform'''
* '''Support competing UIs while collaborating on developing services'''
* '''Encourage framework users (e.g. application developers) to also contribute to the framework'''

=Requirements=

* Make it simple
* Concentrate on core services
* Be programming language agnostic
* Be UI toolkit agnostic
* Try to reuse existing technologies as much as possible, but not at the cost of a bad API

=How to achieve that technically=
* Chose [[Dbus]] as the collaboration line. Below dbus, we can work together. Above dbus, we can differenciate.
* Expose features through dbus APIs implemented by UI and language-agnostic services (daemons).
* Optimize for Openmoko devices, but support multiple architectures and purposes through plugin interfaces and suitable hardware abstraction mechanisms.
* Be not afraid of reinventing the wheel for a wheel-barrow if all the existing wheels are made for sports cars.

=What this is NOT about=

This initiative does not cover low level services such as the
* Bootloader,
* Kernel,
* System Init,

This initiative does not cover high level services as the
* X-Window-System,
* Window Manager,
* Application Launcher,

=Overview=

... picture ...

=Components=

... discussion of subsystem purposes ...

== low level ==
* device
* gsm
* bluetooth
* network
* gps

==High Level==

===PIM===
* intelligent storage database

===Events===
* signaling events via I/O (ringing, blinking, vibrating)
* might use fd.o notification API

===Usage===
* coordinating application I/O requirements (think ''reference counting'' for I/O requirements)
* might use fd.o policy API

===Preferences===
* settings database

===Context===
* Intelligent context API, integrating location as one -- among other -- sources

=Tasks=

==What's there==
* bluez
* gypsy
* geoclue
* py-odeviced
* networkmanager or intel connection manager

==What's missing==
* py-ophoned
* pimd (GSoC 2008 project)
* eventd
* usaged
* preferencesd
* contextd
