''Note: This is the (ongoing) description of the new framework architecture. See [[OpenmokoOldFramework]] for the framework architecture of 2007.1 and 2007.2''

=Purposes=

* '''Give people the infrastructure to create solid and exciting software products based on the Openmoko platform'''
* '''Support competing UIs while collaborating on developing services'''

=Requirements=

* Make it simple
* Concentrate on core services
* Be programming language agnostic
* Be UI toolkit agnostic
* Try to reuse existing technologies as much as possible, but not at the cost of a bad API

=How to achieve that technically=
* Chose [[Dbus]] as the collaboration line. Below dbus, we can work together. Above dbus, we can differenciate.
* Expose features through dbus APIs implemented by UI and language-agnostic services (daemons).
* Optimize for Openmoko devices, but support multiple architectures and purposes through plugin interfaces and suitable hardware abstraction mechanisms.
* Be not afraid of reinventing the wheel for a wheel-barrow if all the existing wheels are made for sports cars.
