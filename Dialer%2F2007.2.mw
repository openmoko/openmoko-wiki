== Communicating with the Dialer ==

The Dialer application has a D-Bus back-end which allows other applications to manipulate the Dialer, and to receive notifications when the Dialer's status changes.

=== Use Cases ===

Here are some use cases:

* Initiate call from another application e.g. the Contacts application.
* Media Player application wants to pause the currently playing media when a call is received, and resume playback when the call ends.
* An application wants to query the status of the Dialer before playing a sound e.g. when an SMS is received.
* The Today application wants to present the user with a list of missed calls.

=== D-Bus Interface ===

The Dialer's D-Bus name, object and interface are "org.openmoko.Dialer", "/org/openmoko/Dialer", "org.openmoko.Dialer", respectively. The Dialer is available on the Session Bus, and is implemented as a service (therefore applications do not need to check that the Dialer is running before caling methods or connecting to signals).

These are the methods which are implemented by the dialer (including arguments):

* '''ShowDialer''' -- ''args in: None, args out: None.'' Presents the user with the main page of the Dialer.
* '''ShowMissedCalls''' -- ''args in: None, args out: None.'' Presents the user with the Missed Calls page.
* '''GetStatus''' -- ''args in: None, args out: int status.'' Returns the current status of the dialer.
* '''Dial''' -- ''args in: string number, args out: None.'' Presents the user with the dialer, and dials the number.

These are the signals which an application can listen to:

* '''IncomingCall''' -- ''args: string number.'' Emitted when there is an incoming call, including the incoming call number (if available).
* '''OutgoingCall''' -- ''args: string number.'' Emitted when the user dials a number.
* '''Talking''' -- ''args: None'' Emitted when a call commences.
* '''HungUp''' -- ''args: None'' Emitted when a call is cancelled or hung up.
* '''Rejected''' -- ''args: None'' Emitted when an incoming call is rejected.
