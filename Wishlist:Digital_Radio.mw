===FM/Digital Radio(DAB) Receiver===
A nice feature would be a radio receiver: FM or even better: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Audio_Broadcasting Digital Audio Broadcast] (Digital Radio)

===AM Radio Receiver===
This is something that gets left out of every consumer electronic device on the face of the planet. Why not include it for those interested in public broadcast frequencies, talk radio and news networks?

How about digtal radio over AM (Digital Radio Mondial aka DRM).

===Multi-standard Radio Receiver===

Or even better a multi-standard receiver. There are combined receiver modules available for DAB/DRM/FM+RDS/AM+AMSS, eg. [[http://www.radioscape.com/Products/Receiver/Multistandard/default.asp RadioScape RS500]].
