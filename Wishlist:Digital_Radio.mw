===FM/Digital Radio(DAB) Receiver===
A nice feature would be a radio receiver: FM or even better: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Audio_Broadcasting Digital Audio Broadcast] (Digital Radio)

===AM/Digital Radio(DRM) Receiver===
This is something that gets left out of every consumer electronic device on the face of the planet. Why not include it for those interested in public broadcast frequencies, talk radio and news networks?

How about digital radio over AM: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_radio_mondiale Digital Radio Mondial].

===Multi-standard Radio Receiver===
Or even better a multi-standard receiver. There are combined receiver modules available for DAB/DRM/FM+RDS/AM+AMSS, eg. [http://www.radioscape.com/Products/Receiver/Multistandard/default.asp RadioScape RS500].

===Family Radio System(FRS) Radio Transceiver===
This is just another standard.  It operates on one of the unlicensed spectrum in North America (I think 2.4GHz).  It's used for 1 to 5 mile walki-talky "party-line" communication in places like amusement parks, camping the wilderness, chatting between cars traveling in a convoy, ect.  It's device to device.  

===Universal Software Radio Peripheral (SDR\USRP) Transceiver===
The best would be generalizing the radio subsystem hardware for multiple transceivers and one or more antenna's.  I have no idea how difficult it is to partition signal among antenna.  However a general purpose radio subsystem would allow international shortwave, NOAA weather, AM, FM, FRS, possibly DAB/DRM/FM+RDS/AM+AMSS, etc., and maybe more.  The USRP would only turn on for whatever specific task it was up to and then can shut off.  Is this infeasible power wise?

Linux already has I think kernel level support for some general purpose radio interfaces.
