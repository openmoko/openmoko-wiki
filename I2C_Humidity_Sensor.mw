The SHT21 is a digital humidity and temperature sensor with a easy to use I2C interface. With just four wires it's rather easy to connect it to your Freerunner. For details see [[I2C]] and [[I2C Pressure Sensor]].

A simple kernel driver is already available from [http://gitorious.org/freerunner-navigation-board/sht21 here].
