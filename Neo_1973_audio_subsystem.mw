== Voice Calls ==

=== using phone-internal microphone and speaker ===

This is teh default case.

* microphone path
** input: built in microphone attached to wolfson MIC2/MIC2N
** routed from wolfson MIC2/MIC2N to MONO1/MONO2
** arrives at GSM Modem input MICIP/MICIN
* speaker path
** input: GSM Modem attached to wolfson RXN/RXP
** routed from wolfson RXN/RXP to ROUT1/LOUT1
** arrives on LM4857 RIN/LIN
** routed on LM4856 to EP+/EP-

=== using analog (4pin 2.5mm) headset ===

This is also a quite common case, since we ship the headset with the
phone

Headset Detection is done via GPIO on S3C2410

* microphone path
** input: headset mic vial HS_MIC attached to wolfson MIC1
** routed from wolfson MIC1 to MONO1/MONO2
** arrives at GSM Modem input MICIP/MICIN
* speaker path
** input: GSM Modem attached to wolfson RXN/RXP
** routed from wolfson RXN/RXP to ROUT1/LOUT1
** arrives on LM4857 RIN/LIN
** routed on LM4856 to LHP/RHP

=== using bluetooth headset ===

Headset detection via software

* microphone path
** input: from bluetooth via PCM interface to wolfson
** wolfson: DAC
** wolfson routes analog signal to MONO1/MONO2
** arrives at GSM Modem input MICIP/MICIN
* speaker path
** input: GSM Modem attached to wolfson RXN/RXP
** wolfson: ADC
** wolfson: routes digital signal to PCM
** arrives on bluetooth chip via PCM

== Multimedia ==

=== sound playback to speakers ===

This is an important mode since it is also required for ringtone
playback

* speaker path 
** input: from S3C2410 via IIS interface to wolfson
** wolfson: DAC
** wolfson: route to ROUT1/LOUT1
** LM4857: arrives on RIN/LIN
** LM4857: route to LLS+-/RLS+-

=== sound playback to headphone ===

* speaker path
** input: from S3C2410 via IIS interface to wolfson
** wolfson: DAC
** wolfson: route to ROUT1/LOUT1
** LM4857: arrives on RIN/LIN
** routed on LM4856 to LHP/RHP

=== sound playback via A2DP ===

FIXME

=== voice recording === 

This is mainly used to record notes

* microphone path
** can be from built-in mic
** or from headset
** or bluetooth headset

== Call recording ==

This is a nice wishlist item.  The user should be able to receive the
full-duplex audio from the wolfson codec, and record it using the
S3C2410 IIS.

== Important issues/pitfalls ==

=== Ringtone while hedset playbac ===

If the user is listening to music on the headset, do we want to mix the
ringtones only into the headset audio, or actually interrupt and play it
on the speaker?
