In the center of the [[Neo1973]] '''audio subsystem''' is the [[WM8753]] (the "Wolfson Codec"), which implements record (ADCs), playback (DACs), and signal mixing. On the stereo output is the [[LM4857]] amplifier, which drives the stereo speakers, the mono earpiece and the headphones. Sound from and to [[GSM]] is received from and sent to the GSM modem via analog connections. There's a digital mono interface for sound from and to the [[Bluetooth]] chip.

= ALSA Channels =

The channel numbers shown here are for the Freerunner, not the 1973.

'''Note''': The ALSA channel numbers changed, probably during this change which is just after the release of 2.6.34:

*) As LOUT1/ROUT1 drives both speaker/sounder and headset, it is
projected to have two dedicated controls for this.
:numid=3,name='Headphone Playback Volume' will be in effect when 
#94 'Amp Spk Switch'=true (speaker mode)
A new control
:numid=95,name='Headphone Playback Volume' will be in effect 
when #94 'Amp Spk Switch'=false (headphone mode)
Two new controls
:numid=96,name='Headphone Playback Switch' 
:numid=97,name='Speaker Playback Switch' 
act as Mute switches:
#96 off->on implies: #97 ->off, #94 ->false
#97 off->on implies: #96 ->off, #94 ->true

RFC:
#93 and #87 are defined as (#96==on) or (#97==on), i.e. if both 
are muted, amp is shut down. We need to test if we have to keep 
special timings and sequence on enabling/disabling these 
controls #87 and #93, e.g. to avoid clicking sounds
</pre>




Four variants of using available Digital Audio Interfaces and DACs/ADC, these correspond to the "DAI Mode" ALSA control values:

[[Image:wolfson_dai_routing.png|800px]]

Keep in mind: left interface (VXxxx) is connected to BlueTooth, right interface (LRC, BCLK, xxxDAT) is connected to SoC (CPU).
So mode "11" at least seems isn't useful at all for the way Neo HW is built. Mode "10" is suited for (Stereo/mono) output and recording for digital world, whereas Mode "00" is needed for GSM<->BT operation (calls via BT-headset) only.

BT-VoIP-calls and BT-stereo-headphones playback are done via direct USB-connection SoC<->BT in a very usual standard-linux-way, and therefor need no statefile or any other setup of mixer.

We are still wondering what use Mode "01" might have, other than analog mixed mono output (which could as well be done at digital side by feeding L/R with same data)

*--[[User:MMlosh|MMlosh]] 10:15, 5 April 2009 (GMT) Mono signal has separate volume control for stereo (control #8) and mono (control #13) output. This might be useful when mixing PCM (VoIP call / music) output into GSM call and playing it locally (and you can still have different volume levels)

= Phase0 Quick Start =

In my experience this works but I have to fiddle with the connection a bit before I get stereo output. The audio also comes out both the speaker and headphones.

 alsactl -f /etc/stereoout.state restore
 madplay myfavoritesong.mp3

Another simple test (assuming you have [[USB_Networking|USB Networking]] configured) is to listen to a radio stream:

 wget -O - http://radioparadise.steadyhost.com:8050 | madplay -

If for some reason you're missing stereoout.state, try getting a similar copy (a couple of volume levels are different is all)

  wget http://opensource.wolfsonmicro.com/~gg/neo1973/stereoout.state

http://opensource.wolfsonmicro.com/~gg/neo1973/gsmbluetooth.state

NOTE this will not work with GTA02, as the control numbers have changed
Here [http://wiki.openmoko.org/images/6/64/Gsmbluetooth_gta02.state.txt] is a modified version that is GTA02 compatible, 
But lacks the Neo Mode settings which disappeared on GTA02, and does not seem to work.

The state file above does not work for me. I created one [http://handheldshell.com/gsm_headset.txt gsm_headset.txt] that is working for audio playback on the freerunner. I will be updating that file as I get the mic routing working.

To use this state file there are a number of steps 

Turn on bluetooth

Pair the headset ( this only needs to be done once ).

Start the audio subsystem and connect the headset http://wiki.bluez.org/wiki/HOWTO/AudioDevices or use my script [http://handheldshell.com/BtHeadset.py BtHeadset.py]

If you don't hear static in your headset at this point you may need to reboot.

Start the phone call

alsactl restore 0 -f [http://handheldshell.com/gsm_headset.txt gsm_headset.txt]

[http://handheldshell.com/bluetooth_pcm bluetooth_pcm]

I wrote a script to stop the headset too [http://handheldshell.com/BtAttach.py BtHeadsetDetach.py]

The above did not work for me; for some reason, the hifi DAC interface must be exercised once before playing.  I have hacked BtHeadset.py to make [http://www.robsims.com/FR-BTAudio FR-BTAudio].  When paired with [http://www.robsims.com/GSMBLUETOOTH.txt GSMBLUETOOTH.txt] I get 2-way high quality audio.

I did a lot of this debugging using [http://www.robsims.com/w8753_dump w8753_dump] which is a quick and dirty hack, but quite useful on a large text window.

= Bluetooth headset with system audio =

For example, using a voip app on the phone with a bt voice headset. This would also be a good way to work on the bluetooth driver without requiring a working GSM and placing a lot of calls.

See ticket 583 for a state file that should route system audio *out* to the headset. The codec does not allow for duplex system audio connected to a headset, so audio in is still using the mic.

NOTE the state file specified does not work for GTA02, and even when modified to be GTA02 compatible still does not route system sound to a BT headset. Modified state file for GTA02 is here 
[http://wiki.openmoko.org/images/3/3d/Btcpu_gta02.state.txt]

= Multimedia =

== sound playback to speakers ==

This is an important mode since it is also required for ringtone
playback

* speaker path 
** input: from S3C2410 via IIS interface to wolfson
** wolfson: DAC
** wolfson: route to ROUT1/LOUT1
** LM4857: arrives on RIN/LIN
** LM4857: route to LLS+-/RLS+-

== sound playback to headphone ==

* speaker path
** input: from S3C2410 via IIS interface to wolfson
** wolfson: DAC
** wolfson: route to ROUT1/LOUT1
** LM4857: arrives on RIN/LIN
** routed on LM4856 to LHP/RHP

=== Driver Status ===

This is working since ASoC 0.13rc2 (-moko6 kernel)

== sound playback via A2DP ==

One way to do this is to use a pulse plugin for bluetooth audio. Pulse would be routed either to the plugin or the default route to the codec. The plugin would watch for headset connect/disconnect events generated by a bluez audio daemon to keep the list of available output devices current.

=== Driver Status ===

There is early work on the bluez daemon to handle this. It has been combined with an alsa plugin in the bluez tree but the alsa plugin probably will not be sufficient for neo.

== voice recording == 

This is mainly used to record notes

* microphone path
** can be from built-in mic
** or from headset
** or bluetooth headset

=== Driver Status ===

UNKNOWN

[http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/User:Herp http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/User:Herp]

[http://wildsau.enemy.org/~moko/voice-recording.state http://wildsau.enemy.org/~moko/voice-recording.state]

= Call recording =

This is a nice wishlist item.  The user should be able to receive the
full-duplex audio from the wolfson codec, and record it using the
S3C2410 IIS.  

== recording ==

It is possible to do PCM recording of a GSM voice call.  In fact, it is even possible to record the local microphone (what you speak) and the remote voice (what is spoken on the other end of the call) to separate channels (L and R of the Stereo ADC).

If you want to record a GSM voice call, please adjust your mixer settings as follows
# Capture Left Mux: ''Line or RXP-RXN''
#* this routes the analog voice from the GSM modem to the left DAC channel
# Capture Right Mux: ''PGA''
#* this routes the microphone input to the right DAC channel

FIXME: test this. There's currently a ASoC kernel driver bug preventing audio capture from working at all.

=== Driver Status ===

UNKNOWN

== playback ==

If you want to play PCM audio into a GSM call (i.e. make your remote partner of a voice call hear your PCM audio, e.g. your mp3 or ogg files.

If you are inside a voice call (e.g. FSO/zhone), open amixer or load a state file with alsactl and change the following mixer controls:
# Mono Mixer Left
#* this enables audio routing from the Stereo DAC left channel to the Mono Out (GSM Modem)
# Mono Mixer Right Playback Switch
#* this enables audio routing from the Stereo DAC right channel to the Mono Out (GSM Modem)
# PCM Level
#* adjust the PCM Level up to the desired playback volume

=== Driver Status ===

UNKNOWN

== Recording and Playback .state ==
Here is a state file that allows both recording and playback from and to a gsm call. <br>
File: [[Image:Callrec.txt]]

To record just issue:

arecord -D hw:0,0 -r 8000 -f S16_LE -c 2 record.wav

and to inject sound just issue:

aplay -D hw:0,0 record.wav

If you have any problems you can contact me on IRC, TAsn.

P.S
There's a bug concerning the Right and Left mux, you have to change the left after you change the right, loading the state file may cause this issue to show, so just in case, I recommend appending:

amixer sset 'Capture Right Mux' 'Line or RXP-RXN'

amixer sset 'Capture Left Mux' 'Line or RXP-RXN'

to the alsactl -f Callrec.txt restore command.

== Recording and maintaining a call .state ==
For the actual recording:
arecord -D hw:0,0 -r 8000 -f S16_LE -c 2 record.wav

please note that this is the state file I wrote for my [[Call Recorder]], so if you need anything you might miss here, just go and check it's source.

The actual state for gsmhandset (gsmhandset.state):
[[Image:callrec-gsmhandset.txt]]

A patch (diff gsmhandset.txt callrec-gsmhandset.txt) to apply on every state file, including gsmheadset.state and gsmspeakerout.state.

= Userspace Sound Control Daemon =

The userspace sound control deamon might be a separate process or (more likely) part of some larger general hardware management daemon.


It will provide the following features:

= audio playback =

In order to provide the desired functionality, the daemon first needs to be capable of doing audio playback.

* supported formats
** mp3 (libmad)
** ogg/vorbis (libtremor)
** mod (mikmod)
** sid (sidplay)
* supported functionality
** start and stop playback
** interrupt previous sound to play new sound
** enqueue new sound at end of previous sound
** smooth fade-in/fade-out

= audio event management =
* manage a set of events (basically just a name for each event)
* manage a set of audio themes
** each theme contains list of event->audio_file_name mappings
** themes stored/managed via gconf
* manage event sources
** built-in event sources, e.g. touchscreen/button press
** external event sources (e.g. gsmd, dbus, ...)

= audio scenario management =
* e.g. dialer or even gsmd can request audio subsystem to switch to voicecall mode
* this mainly affects codec/amplifier analog audio routing
* integrated with bluetooth in case of BT headset or A2DP use
* How is this management performed currently?

= Important issues/pitfalls =

== Ringtone while headset playback ==

If the user is listening to music on the headset, we want to mix the
ring tones only into the headset audio, as we must not interrupt and play it on the speaker. Reason: headset can't be switched off during playback via speaker, so to avoid extremely loud headset playback there must NOT be any speaker playback while headset is inserted.

In expression: loading speakerout.state is deprecated while JACK_INSERT is asserted.
