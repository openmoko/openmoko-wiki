=== Voice Calls ===

==== using phone-internal microphone and speaker ====

This is the default case.

* microphone path
** input: built in microphone attached to wolfson MIC2/MIC2N
** routed from wolfson MIC2/MIC2N to MONO1/MONO2
** arrives at GSM Modem input MICIP/MICIN
* speaker path
** input: GSM Modem attached to wolfson RXN/RXP
** routed from wolfson RXN/RXP to ROUT1/LOUT1
** arrives on LM4857 RIN/LIN
** routed on LM4856 to EP+/EP-

===== Internal Codec Route =====

Neo Mode is GSM Handset
Amp Mode is Call Speaker

* audio path Mic -> GSM
** MIC2/MIC2N
** Mic2 Volume
** ALC Micer Mic2
** Left PGA
** Mic Sidetone Mux [Left PGA]
** Mono Sidetone Volume
** Mono Mixer Sidetone Playback Switch
** Mono Volume
** Mono 2 Mux [Inverted Mono 1]

* audio path GSM -> Speaker
** RXP/RXN
** Rx Mixer [RXP - RXN]
** Line Left Mux [Rx Mix]/Line Right Mux [Rx Mix]
** Left Mixer Bypass Playback Switch/Right Mixer Bypass Playback Switch
** Headphone Volume

===== Driver Status =====

This should be supported by ASoC 0.13rc3 (-moko7 kernel) on.

ASoC 0.13.3 should have same functionality but has renamed the soundcard to neo1973.

For ASoC 0.13.3 http://opensource.wolfsonmicro.com/~gg/neo1973/gsmhandset.state

==== using analog (4pin 2.5mm) headset ====

This is also a quite common case, since we ship the headset with the
phone

Headset Detection is done via GPIO on S3C2410

* microphone path
** input: headset mic vial HS_MIC attached to wolfson MIC1
** routed from wolfson MIC1 to MONO1/MONO2
** arrives at GSM Modem input MICIP/MICIN
* speaker path
** input: GSM Modem attached to wolfson RXN/RXP
** routed from wolfson RXN/RXP to ROUT1/LOUT1
** arrives on LM4857 RIN/LIN
** routed on LM4856 to LHP/RHP

===== Internal Codec Route =====

Neo Mode is GSM Headset
Amp Mode is Headphones

* audio path Mic -> GSM
** MIC1
** Mic Selection Mux [Mic 1]
** ALC Mixer Mic1
** Left PGA
** Mic Sidetone Mux [Left PGA]
** Mono Sidetone Volume
** Mono Mixer Sidetone Playback Switch
** Mono Volume
** Mono 2 Mux [Inverted Mono 1]

* Audio path GSM -> Headphones
** RXP/RXN
** Rx Mixer [RXP - RXN]
** Line Left Mux [Rx Mix]/Line Right Mux [Rx Mix]
** Left Mixer Bypass Playback Switch/Right Mixer Bypass Playback Switch
** Headphone Volume

===== Driver Status =====

Supported in ASoC 0.13.3

==== using Bluetooth headset ====

Headset detection via software

* microphone path
** input: from bluetooth via PCM interface to wolfson
** wolfson: DAC
** wolfson routes analog signal to MONO1/MONO2
** arrives at GSM Modem input MICIP/MICIN
* speaker path
** input: GSM Modem attached to wolfson RXN/RXP
** wolfson: ADC
** wolfson: routes digital signal to PCM
** arrives on bluetooth chip via PCM

===== Driver Status =====

UNKNOWN

==== sound playback to speakers ====

This is an important mode since it is also required for ringtone
playback

* speaker path 
** input: from S3C2410 via IIS interface to wolfson
** wolfson: DAC
** wolfson: route to ROUT1/LOUT1
** LM4857: arrives on RIN/LIN
** LM4857: route to LLS+-/RLS+-

===== Driver Status =====

This is working since ASoC 0.13rc2 (-moko6 kernel)

===== asound.state =====

==== sound playback to headphone ====

* speaker path
** input: from S3C2410 via IIS interface to wolfson
** wolfson: DAC
** wolfson: route to ROUT1/LOUT1
** LM4857: arrives on RIN/LIN
** routed on LM4856 to LHP/RHP

===== Driver Status =====

This is working since ASoC 0.13rc2 (-moko6 kernel)

==== sound playback via A2DP =====

==== voice recording ==== 

This is mainly used to record notes

* microphone path
** can be from built-in mic
** or from headset
** or bluetooth headset

===== Driver Status =====

=== Call recording ===

This is a nice wishlist item.  The user should be able to receive the
full-duplex audio from the wolfson codec, and record it using the
S3C2410 IIS.

=== Ringtone while headset playback ===

If the user is listening to music on the headset, do we want to mix the
ring tones only into the headset audio, or actually interrupt and play it
on the speaker?
