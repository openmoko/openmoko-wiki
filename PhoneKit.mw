== PhoneKit ==

A new phone functionality d-bus service for GUI applications.

Exposes a high level d-bus api to phone commands and events. Very
similar to current d-bus functionality exposed by Dialer (for example,
Dial function and incoming-call event).

Updates the journal on gsmd initiated events such as incoming sms or
voice mail.

Produces system model GUI dialogs for call handling (incoming, outgoing,
in call) and manages pin entry on network registration.
