The Neo1973 has a touchscreen. The touchscreen can be used to control a pointer on the screen. Using communication to a PC the touchscreen can control the pointer on the PC. The communication can be either USB or Bluetooth. Using this it should be possible to emulate a simple graphics tablet.

== Option: Display screen on smartphone ==

Depending on the bandwidth it may be possible to replicate either part of or a scaled down version of the PC's screen directly on the smartphone. To do this the driver must be a bit more advanced. It might consist of 2 parts: The graphics tablet driver and a facility to transfer the screen. VNC or FreeNX might solve this.

== Option: Pressure sensitivity ==

The Neo1973 has a screen that is capable of multitouch, only the driver is missing. If multitouch is available, then pressure sensitivity may be possible: The harder you press the finger, the bigger the area your finger covers. If the sensitivity is really good you may be able to use a brush directly on the screen. The physical brush will also provide the tilt functionality.

Cite? It's been stated that later versions may do multitouch, where is it metioned that this one can, which would be great?
