====DVB-T==== 
Is available in most of Europe and parts of Asia. This standard is on the way in many African countries. Propably shouldn't be expected in the American market? DVB-T is an open standard, so it should be possible to find GPL'ed chips.
Not made for handheld devices so the phone would propaby be huge and hot.

====DVB-S====
Lots of free quality tv, but nobody has space for a 60cm satelit dish in their pockets theese days.

====DVB-H====
Open standard for digital terrestrial tv for handheld devices. In trial state in most of the [http://www.dvb-h.org/services.htm world]. Propably the best solution for tv on a phone.

Open standard for digital satelite tv for handheld devices
