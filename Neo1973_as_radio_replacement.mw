AGPS test gui: All fixes are good, although the gps antenna is just taped on top in the radio shaft (see picture below)

The white box on the right is the car hifi amplifier, i used a very cheap 30W amplifier [[http://www.elektronik-star.de/product_info.php/cPath/25_26/products_id/380]]. It is sufficient for my standard golf2 speakers, it is small and it does not emit much heat. So it is perfect to be putted it in the radio shaft. The taped black thing in the middle of the picture (on top in the radio shaft) is the gps antenna. It is an Navilock NL-65AT MMCX (see [[GPS_antennas_for_neo1973]] for more information), it works astonishing good there.
