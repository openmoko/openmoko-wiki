If you do not have Linux on your system and can not install it for the moment, get yourself a Linux Live CD, such as the Ubuntu Desktop CD: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download
A Linux Live CD will not alter your existing Windows (or whatever) installation.

Start Ubuntu from the CD, download the files (dfu-util, rootfs, kernel) as described into /tmp

Make dfu-util executable by "chmod +x ./dfu-util" and then flash the kernel and rootfs like described, but make sure that you execute dfu-util as root, putting "sudo" in front of dfu-util does the trick ("sudo dfu-util ...").
