==Distributions==
{{DistributionBox|
Name=Qtmoko [v20&v21]|
Description=QtMoko is distribution based on Qtopia (or QtExtended) from Trolltech for your 
Neo Freerunner.

Here is list of changes since previous stable version (v19): 

* hopefully fixed bug #80 (lost sms, thanks to Judge_Gregg's great bug report) 
* SMS messages should stay on SIM now 
* wifi always available after boot (OM bug #2327) thanks to Gennady for his fix. 
* more sane power management values by default (suspend after 5 minutes) 
* added path to /usr/games (for scummvm and other games) 
* modified kernel config - all FR hardware is now build in 
* in QX you can enable rotation using accelerometers 
* QMplayer uses /media/card for saving media if possible|

The only difference between v20 and v21 is the kernel. v20 uses the 2.6.32 kernel and is still experimental.
