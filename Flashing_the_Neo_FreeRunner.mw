As Openmoko development continues, Openmoko regularly releases updated versions of the Openmoko root filesystem, the kernel, and the[[Bootloader| U-Boot]]. These may be programmed into the Flash memory of Neo FreeRunner. You can use the USB cable and Openmoko provided tool to flash Neo FreeRunner.

{{note|The Openmoko software team builds images daily. If you want to use the latest images, you can download the image from the daily build, but we recommend you download the most stable image from http://downloads.openmoko.org/releases/Freerunner/. Images here have been tested by the test team.

See [[Latest Images]] for more information about the different images available.}}
{{note|If you have a working image that you're happy with but want to try something different, you should probably do a [[Pre-Flash Backup]], although it looks like the method on that page may not entirely work.}}

===Step 1. Download the DFU-util===

You can download the flashing tool from: 
http://downloads.openmoko.org/releases/Freerunner/dfu-util

On the GNU/Linux host you can use the following command to download the dfu-util:
 wget http://downloads.openmoko.org/releases/Freerunner/dfu-util

Afterwards you have to change the rights on the file:
 chmod a+x dfu-util

===Step 2. Flashing the Kernel===

[[Image:menu15.jpg|thumb|Log into U-Boot in NOR Flash, connect your Neo with Linux Host via USB cable]]

First, [[FreeRunner/Buttons_and_LEDs#Basic_Button_Usage|log into U-Boot in the NOR Flash]]. The Neo FreeRunner needs to be at the NOR boot menu for flashing.  For more information on booting, see [[Booting the Neo FreeRunner| booting the Neo Freerunner]].

'''Then''', connect your Neo to the GNU/Linux host via USB cable.

You can download the kernel from 
http://downloads.openmoko.org/releases/Freerunner/

Type in the following command in the terminal on a GNU/Linux host. On some systems you need to be root before this will work and on Ubuntu you must preface the command with "sudo" or you will get the following error: "Cannot claim interface: could not claim interface 2: Operation not permitted"

 ./dfu-util -a (partion name) -R -D (download image file name)

ex:

 sudo ./dfu-util -a kernel -R -D uImage-2.6.24+git20080424-om-gta02.bin

Press Enter to execute the command.

When flashing succeeds the following will be shown:

 status(0) = No error condition is present
 Done!

{{note| The meaning of the parameters you specified:
-a  --alt alt Specify the altsetting of the DFU interface by name or by number<br>
-R  --reset Issue USB Reset signalling once we're finished<br>
-D  --download file Write firmware from<file> into device <br>
}}

===Step 3. Flashing the Root Filesystem ===
You can download the root filesystem from:
http://downloads.openmoko.org/releases/Freerunner/

Type the following command in the terminal of a GNU/Linux host. On some systems you will need to be root.

 ./dfu-util -a rootfs -R -D openmoko-devel-image-fic-gta02.jffs2

When flashing succeeds the following will be shown:

 status(0) = No error condition is present
 Done!
