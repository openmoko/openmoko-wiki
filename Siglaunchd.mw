{{Languages|siglaunchd}}

This project is daemon which listens to dbus signals and runs applications accordingly.
The signals, application to run and some rules that will be evaluated against incoming dbus signals can be easily changed in the configuration file.
This application is mainly intended to work with the openmoko framework so end users will be able to run application uppon events without too much effort, though that isn't a limitation.
For example, one can set the aux button to launch the dialer and the other can set a sound when screen is dimmed with as little as no effort.

(The default config file is set so open moko terminal will be run when the aux button is pressed for two or more seconds)

= Package =
* author: Tom Hacohen <available_at_profile>
* this is a python script so code resides in /usr/bin/siglaunchd (hopefuly in a public svn soon)
* link: [http://stosb.com/openmoko/siglaunchd_0.1_armv4t.ipk package]


== TODO ==
* upgrade the rules system
* add errors (and a log file?) when the configuration file is broken
* build sample applications to go with it
* change it to store the configuration in both ~ and /etc so people will be able to define system actions as well as user actions. (of course will have to run twice because we don't want the user to run with root permissions, assuming moko will ever have user privileges implemented... *wink*)
* support for comments in the configuration file
* < and > only supports floats, add string support (= works with strings).
* add more complex variable types for comparison in the rules
