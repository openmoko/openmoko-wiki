== Production Test Introduction ==

After device finish engineering prototypes stage, hardware engineer will need to provide test specification and pass criteria base on the product specification. Production test also could be treated as a simplified regulatlation test, because it has to fulfill standard of worldwide standard (for example: GSM) of local regulation (for example: Wi-Fi).

The target of production test, is deliver quality products. And production test won't go through all engineering details, because factory have time constriant on each station and production line also has cycle time for efficient for production.

== Process flow ==

* Major test process

** PCBA level test: Target of PCBA test is make sure the surface mount quality and the main component works properly 

** Pre-assembly test: Usually a production will include attached modules, and connected with FPC (flexable plastic cable) or connectors, pre-assembly test will test system function with module attached

** After-assembly test: After assembly is final product test, all major function need to be verified before product shipping.
