== Production Test Introduction ==

After device finish engineering prototypes stage, hardware engineer will need to provide test specification and pass criteria base on the product specification. Production test also could be treated as a simplified regulatlation test, because it has to fulfill standard of worldwide standard (for example: GSM) of local regulation (for example: Wi-Fi).

== Process flow ==

Ususally production test including 3 major parts:

* PCBA level test

Target of PCBA test is make sure the surface mount quality and the main component works properly 

* Pre-assembly test

Usually a production will include attached modules, and connected with FPC (flexable plastic cable) or connectors, pre-assembly test will test system function with module attached

* After-assembly test

After assembly is final product test, all major function need to be verified before product shipping.
