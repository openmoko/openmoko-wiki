== Production Test Introduction ==

After device finish engineering prototypes stage, hardware engineer will need to provide test specification and pass criteria base on the product specification. Production test also could be treated as a simplified regulatlation test, because it has to fulfill standard of worldwide standard (for example: GSM) of local regulation (for example: Wi-Fi).

The target of production test, is deliver quality products. And production test won't go through all engineering details, because factory have time constriant on each station and production line also has cycle time for efficient for production.

Windows embedded also provide a testkit called CETK for embedded device testing, you could look into more detail in MSDN web site [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa934353.aspx CETK]

== Process flow ==

* Major test process

** PCBA level test: Target of PCBA test is make sure the surface mount quality and the main component works properly

** Pre-assembly test: Usually a production will include attached modules, and connected with FPC (flexable plastic cable) or connectors, pre-assembly test will test system function with module attached

** After-assembly test: After assembly is final product test, all major function need to be verified before product shipping.


== Fixture Design ==

Fixture design base on required test item and test point location. At design time, should consider all re-quired test point in the PCB, and must easy accessable during PCBA/PCBA with module/Assembly. If test point and fixture design was bad, it will make product non-mass productionable.

=== Test point ===

Important test point during GTA production including:

* Consoleuart TX/RX
* GPS RF test port
* GSM RF test port
* Wi-Fi RF test port
* Battery test point
* Vibrator test point
* Auto power on test point
* Modem power on test point
* JTAG test point
* USB test point
* SIM card test point
* SD card test point
* Earphone (also connect to Modem IR port)

=== Fixture ===

Fixture used for speed up production process, it also has life cycle and need maintance during prodction process. All the connector/test pin/plugs are expendable, and should could be fixed in time during every production process.

Every device has it's own specification and requirement, so the fixture design and requirement should base on device charactics to adjust process. Follwoing just GTA case for your reference.

For example, GTA using following test fixture during production

* Initial u-boot download
* GSM test
* DM1 test
* DM1.5 test
* GPS C/N test /w shielding case
* Wi-Fi test /w shielding case
* Bluetooth test /w shielding case

For development process, all fixture could be integrated into 1 fixture for speed up test software development process. But integrated fixture will cost more and will have more chance get broken during production process, also, integrated fixture need attach every expensive test equipment, and make fixture duplication very non-practical because the cost of expensive test equipment. But singal/integrated test fixture DO very useful during trial run process for software verification.

Factory tend to spilt fixture into simple function and easy maintainable unit, and also could cost saving/balance production line flow process. Base on device charactics and factory process/equipment availability.

=== Test equipment ===

GTA uses following equipment during production process:

* Programmable power supply
* Battery emulator
* CMU-200
* SMU-200
* GPS simulator
* GPS signal re-radiation
* Spectrum FSP-6 and others
* Wi-Fi access point
* RF shielding box
* RF Attenuator
* RF signal divider

==== Device Module Test 1 (DM1) ====

Fix it

==== Device Module Test 2 (DM2) ====

Fix it

=== GTA02 ===



==== GTA02 process flow ====

Surface mount -> Visual inspection -> DM1 download (JTAG) -> GSM firmware download -> GSM test -> DM1 test -> Attach Bluetooth/Wi-Fi/LCM -> DM1.5 (Boot from SD card) -> Housing assembly -> DM2 (Boot from SD card)-> QA -> Packaging -> QA -> Release

* DM1.5 also downlaod NOR u-boot image into NOR flash

* DM2 download release product image after DM2 test finished

==== Device Module Test 1 (DM1) ====

DM1 is target for verify main chip component's basic function and surface mount quality. GTA02 integrate DM1 test functions into u-boot, and using the debug board JTAG interface download production u-boot to target board.


* HDQ : Read HDQ via barrety connector
* USB host power : Provide 5v USB host power
* Accelerometer : Check SPI and interrupt behavior
* NOR flash : Read the NOR ID
* Charging : Input USB power and check PMU charging current
* Power/Aux key : Check Button mechanical
* GPS C/N : Check the signal/noise ratio of GPS
* Backup battery : Backup battery for PMU's RTC
* Battery voltage : Read PMU battery voltage
* LED : Full color of LED
* GSM : CPU communicate with GSM module
* GPU - SMedia : Chip self check
* Vibrator : Check the vibrator path
* Earphone (Audio path) : Audio codec path

===== GTA02 DM1 Test Procedure =====

Station D1

* Put device in the fixture

* Power up DUT through fixture, download DM1 source into DUT by using Devirginator and JTAG

Station D2

* Scan PCBA barcode

* Put device in the fixture

* Power up DUT through fixture

* Excute serial command program/script from the host PC

* Verify the test result, and upload the result to host PC
