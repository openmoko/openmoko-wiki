{{Hdsupport}}
like FIC is going to develop another device for OpenMoko quite soon, with the (code)name <b>HXD8</b>. On May 26th 2007  (GMT)  Sean [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2007-May/005407.html confirmed] the existence of the device, said hardware support was almost done and cleverly told us to wait anxiously. 

According to [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2007-October/011324.html this post] the device is a networked collaborative automotive GPS unit, from http://dash.net/ .

==Hardware==
From the information found in the [https://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/doc/hardware/HXD8v011/ hardware documentation] and [https://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/src/target/kernel/patches/ kernel patches] parts of the subversion repositories, the following specifications can be predicted.

===Processor===
According to https://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/src/target/kernel/patches/s3c2440-nand-disable-hwecc.patch the HXD8 will feature an [http://www.samsung.com/Products/Semiconductor/common/product_list.aspx?family_cd=MSC0102 S3C2440], capable of running up to 400MHz. The features are the same as the [http://www.samsung.com/products/semiconductor/MobileSoC/ApplicationProcessor/ARM9Series/S3C2410/S3C2410.htm S3C2410] plus a camera interface. 
*GPIO Assignments: https://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/doc/hardware/HXD8v011/gpio.txt

===Flash===
According to a currently available hardware patch, the device supports 1 NAND Flash device of up to 4G. (uncertain about what kind of G that is. Could be 4Gb (which makes about 0,5GB), could be 4GB). 

Some other patch implies that there is the possibility of connecting 3 NAND Flash chips.

===RAM===
128MB Random Access Memory, of which 2MB is used as a Framebuffer. https://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/src/target/u-boot/patches/uboot-hxd8.patch

===GSM/GPRS===
Using same GSM modem on GTA01 and GTA02, TI Calypso with 850/1800/1900 configuration.

=== SD-Card ===
The HXD8 features either an SD, miniSD or microSD-card slot.
* Connected to: S3C2410 MMC/SD controller
* Driver: https://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/src/target/kernel/patches/s3c_mci.patch

===LCD Module (LCM)===
The HXD8 features a 480x272 pixel LCD (which is a widescreen (16:9) ratio) with PWM-controlled backlight.



===Light Sensor===
The HXD8 features a light sensor by TAOS Inc. (Texas Advanced Optoelectronic Solutions). It's either a [http://www.taosinc.com/product_detail.asp?cateid=4&proid=59 TLS2560] or a [http://www.taosinc.com/product_detail.asp?cateid=4&proid=60 TLS2561]. This light sensor will be included to measure ambient illuminance to control the LCM backlight illumination, or for exposure control for the camera (depends on location of the chip).

===Power Management===
A Philips PCF50606 is used for power management.

* Connected to: S3C2440 via I2C.

===WiFi===
HXD8 features an SPI-connected Marvell 8686 based WiFi module.

===GPS===
The PMU chip's config contains a voltage group called GPS_3V3, and the [https://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/doc/hardware/HXD8v011/gpio.txt gpio.txt] a set of GPS UART data pins. HXD8 using SirfSTAR III based module solution
