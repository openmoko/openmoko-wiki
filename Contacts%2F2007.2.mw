=== Navigation ===

The Navigation pane allows the user to locate existing contacts, either by filtering on a particular group of contacts, or by a text search on the contact name. The Navigation pane also allows quick access to common functions such as dial, SMS and new. The dial and SMS functions would use the preferred number of the contact unless otherwise specified.

=== Details ===

The Details pane display the attributes of the selected contact. It has two modes: View and Edit. In view mode, tapping the attributes gives a list of possible actions. For example, tapping a phone number will display a menu with "Dial" and "Message" options.

In Edit mode, tapping the attributes allows the user to edit or remove the attribute. An extra row is also available to allow the user to add a new attribute.
