[http://www.mail-archive.com/support@lists.openmoko.org/msg04770.html Ingvaldur Sigurjonsson] wrote a little python script allowing us to migrate contacts in *.vcf Format to the paroli phonebook. [http://blog.1407.org/2009/06/11/import-vcf-contacts-into-paroli/ Rui Seabra] did some additional work on the script. Thanks to those two men, we can now import contacts in *.vcf-files into paroli's phonebook.

To use this script, [http://files.1407.org/openmoko/contacts/vcf2paroli download it] and use it as follows:

 ./vcf2paroli -i yourfile.vcf -o phone

Copy the resulting file to your Neo Freerunner '''after''' you've stopped paroli ! On the Neo do:

 killall paroli

Then copy over the file created by vcf2paroli:

 scp phone root@192.168.0.202:/home/root/.paroli/contacts/phone

Now restart paroli

 paroli

You should now have your contacts imported to Paroli.


==Known problems==


===Special characters are not properly shown in paroli===

Use UTF-8 for special characters. You can use iconv to convert your vcf-file to UTF-8.

 iconv -t UTF-8 yourfile.vcf -o yourfile_utf8.vcf

Now proceed as stated above.

===I keep getting "CELL" and "VOICE" in the "Name" Section of the phonebook===

Have a look at your *.vcf file. It probably looks like this:

 BEGIN:VCARD
 VERSION:3.0
 N:;John Doe;;;
 FN:John Doe 
 TEL;CELL;VOICE:+4300123456
 END:VCARD

Change the line containg the number to the following:

 BEGIN:VCARD
 VERSION:3.0
 N:;John Doe;;;
 FN:John Doe 
 TEL;;:+4300123456
 END:VCARD
 
Now you'll get correct entries into your adress book.

===I dont have a *.vcf file of my contacts but a csv===

Happend to me too, my old phone just gave me csv. Have some time ready to migrate your contacts, if its just 10 entries or so, consider transferring them manually. Anyways, there are some tools out there, like [http://csv2vcard.sourceforge.net/ csv2vcard] as standalone ruby script or an [http://homepage.mac.com/phrogz/CSV2vCard_v2.html online csv2vcard converter]. Choose for yourself, in any way you should end up with something like:

 BEGIN:VCARD
 VERSION:3.0
 N:;John Doe;;;
 FN:John Doe 
 TEL;;:+4300123456
 END:VCARD

You probably need to do some editing, for me this was adding the + or the leading zero for all numbers, they somehow got lost. Dont forget to eventually convert the resulting *.vcf to UTF-8.
