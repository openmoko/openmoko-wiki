== Questions for nice people with hardware, or designers ==
 
=== What is the current drawn in each state? ===
* 'off'
* LCD off, processor idle.
* LCD on, processor idle.
* LCD off, processor fully active.
* Bluetooth on.
* GSM module in normal 'idle' state, connected to a cell.
* GPS on (including agpsd)

Some of these may of course change due to improving power managment, or newer hardware.
Thanks.

=== More Pictures ===
* Pictures of the assembled phone from all angles, showing every part, for both users, and people who want to consider assembling hardware.
* Pictures of the covers from all angles - inside and out, again for those considering hardware.
Thanks.
