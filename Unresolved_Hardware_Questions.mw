Unresolved hardware questions on the Neo1973, and other platforms.
*Questions that can probably only be answered by FIC staff
**Power managment information in [[Neo1973_Power_Management]] needs to be updated by someone with schematics.
*Questions that only require access to hardware.
*Power consumption in various modes - by someone with P1 hardware.
**Find a multimeter with a current range of at least 500mA. 
**Charge your neo fully.
**Get a USB-USB extension lead - or a lead that fits the neo, one you have spare.
**Carefully remove the outer plastic covering over a short - 5cm section in the middle of the cable.
**Part any silver shielding under the wire to reveal the four insulated wires.
**Cut the red wire. (not the blue wire, or it explodes! :) )
**Strip the ends of the wires, and connect the multimeter set on 500mA to them.
**Check you have not damaged any other wires, and check that the ends of the red wires or the probes cannot short against the exposed shielding.
**Plug neo into this cable (either directly, or if it's used as a charging cable
**Observe current reading on multimeter. 1ma=5mW (approx).
*Figures that would be of use, in order of importance.
**Idle with backlight on at main screen.
**Idle with backlight off at main screen.
**Idle with backlight on, and GSM off.
**CPU maxed out - md5sum /dev/zero, backlight on
**Playing MP3 with backlight on and volume off.
**Playing MP3 with speakers on high, loudly.
**Active on a call with backlight on.
**Idle running only gllin with backlight on.
**Off
**Suspended with GSM on
**Suspended with GSM off
**'''Charging with flat battery, on and off'''
*** (h/w revision 0x0240 (P1 bv4))
***On:  496mA
***Off: 50mA
***'''The u-boot options controlling auto-fast charging have no effect whatsoever. Neo will only charge with 50mA when turned off (FIXME: add u-boot version)'''
*The aim is to get the following numbers. CPU Idle and max. Backlight power. Audio power max. GSM modem max, normal and off.
