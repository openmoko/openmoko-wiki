QSuunto-Lite - display dive log information from Suunto Dive computers (that work with divetools-ab)

===What you need===
To display the log just upload them to your Freerunner and open them through the file open dialog. To generate the files use divetools-ab http://www.acs.uni-duesseldorf.de/~becka/download/dive/.

To download them on your Freerunner you need an adaptor to attach your USB cable (or your USB/serial adaptor) to the Freerunner, change the USB to host mode and use my patched version (to work with USB) of divetools-ab (you find it in the same repo as qsuunto-lite) and download directly to Freerunner.

===What is planned===
* Download dive logs directly from QSuunto-Lite
* Display dive profile graphically
* Support newer Suuntos (D6,D9, etc.) - ''if'' someone can help me to make a binary to read out the logs on the base of divetools-ab's vyperlink. I do not own one of the newer Suunto's but if you do and would like to help please contact me on the Community mailing list.
