QSuunto-Lite - display dive log information from Suunto Dive computers (that work with divetools-ab).

===What you need===
To display the log just upload them to your Freerunner and open them through the file open dialog. To generate the files use divetools-ab http://www.acs.uni-duesseldorf.de/~becka/download/dive/.

To download them on your Freerunner you need an adaptor to attach your USB cable (or your USB/serial adaptor) to the Freerunner, change the USB to host mode and use my patched version (to work with USB) of divetools-ab (you find it in the same repo as qsuunto-lite) and download directly to Freerunner.

===What is planned===
* Download dive logs directly from QSuunto-Lite
* Display dive profile graphically
* Support newer Suuntos (D6,D9, etc.) - ''if'' someone can help me to make a binary to read out the logs on the base of divetools-ab's vyperlink. I do not own one of the newer Suunto's but if you do and would like to help please contact me on the Community mailing list or on this page.

==Future plans==
This application will be "finished" when above targets are achieved. Then I want to create a real dive logging app, that supports many DC, manually editing of logs, GPS integration (dive sites), and export functions (udcf, uddf), ... Everyone interested in contributing please contact me. In my eyes Openmoko phones are perfect device for divelogging as they offer USB, bluetooth and GPS which makes it really handy for many DCs.
