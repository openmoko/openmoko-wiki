Three years ago Jane had a stroke which made her unable to speak. Her intelligence is unaffected, but she cannot find the words.
 
How can she use a mobile phone to communicate with her husband when the words are gone? When her husband is on the phone, asking - What are you doing? Do you want to have lunch with me?
 
To answer his first question about what she is doing, sheâ€™s sending him a small picture, showing a cup of tea. And then, a second picture with a heart, and he answers he loves her too. Then he asks if they can meet, he want to have a cup of tea as well, and she answers by sending him a GPS location picture and he can hear the street address of the small restaurant where she is right now. If there was a phone that made all this possible, I bet she would want one.
