Three years ago Jane had a stroke which made her unable to speak. Her intelligence is unaffected, but she cannot find the words.
 
How can she use a mobile phone to communicate with her husband when the words are gone? When her husband is on the phone, asking - What are you doing? Do you want to have lunch with me?
 
To answer his first question about what she is doing, sheâ€™s sending him a small picture, showing a cup of tea. And then, a second picture with a heart, and he answers he loves her too. Then he asks if they can meet, he want to have a cup of tea as well, and she answers by sending him her GPS location and he can hear the street address of the small restaurant where she is right now. If there was a phone that made all this possible, I bet she would want one.


This short story is capturing what this project is all about -- to build a mobile phone for people with aphasia. To use to communicate with the rest of the world.


[[FSO]] is the baseline, [[Erlang]] is the framework. Simplicity and Experimentation are my personal mantra's.


==Basics==

The goal of a clean and uncluttered GUI without menus is not an easy task, but after some trial and error I think I got the general idea. The metaphor of moving around in 2 dimensions by sweeping a finger from one corner of the screen to another gave me the space I needed for the applications as well as thousands of pictures to use for communication.


==The first step, the dialer==

FSO takes care of most of the functionality when it comes to dial, answer, ring-tone etc. All I had to do was a clean dialer GUI. It sits in the space you are at when you start fresh. There is no presentation of the number you are dialing, just the buttons with figures and * and #. To place the call you dial the number and press_and_hold the green button. To hang up you press_and_hold the red button. When there is an incoming call the GUI will move to this space, and you press_and_hold the green button.
