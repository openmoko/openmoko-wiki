Paroli is a new approach to application development on the Openmoko phones. It is actually able, in combination with Om2009 distribution to make Freerunner work as a simple phone.
It's based on top of the [[OpenmokoFramework|FSO framework]] and enables the use of it via a core and several services.

== Stuff that works ==

* Paroli actually makes FR a simple, very working phone!!

* ability to turn off PIN check & change pin! (I think it's the first
distro that can do it :)
* Connecting to WLAN (with WPA, WPA2, WEP)
* suspend & resume
* etc etc

==Installation / download ==

=== Full distro ===

To install the [[Om2009]] distribution download the uImage and fso-paroli-image from http://downloads.openmoko.org/distro/testing/NeoFreerunner/

=== Only the package ===
In order to get the package from unstable you'll need to adjust the configuration of opkg:

 <nowiki>echo src/gz openmoko-unstable-armv4t http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/unstable/armv4t > /etc/opkg/om-unstable.conf</nowiki>

Then do an opkg-update and opkg install paroli.

This should get you the newest version.
