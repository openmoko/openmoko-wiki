In a few words one could say: paroli is a new approach to application development on the Openmoko phones.
Paroli is based on top of the [[OpenmokoFramework|FSO framework]] and enables the use of it via a core and several services.

For more information please visit [http://www.paroli-project.org/ Paroli website]

== Getting the sources ==

 git clone http://git.paroli-project.org/paroli.git/

==biggest changes:==
- a launcher was introduced allowing the launching of paroli-applications from within paroli itself.
- the dbus interface is optional and both modes should work.

- closing application windows from within the window-manager does not kill the process anymore

- introduction of a preliminary audio service allowing to mute calls (a test service for non-fso environments was also added).

- a reworked version of the dialer was added

- works on an error-message service have begun

- works on a service checking for changes in the fso have begun and many small fixes in the code

===7 days update Feb 13 ~ Feb 20===


- gotten daily build unstable images which by now boot directly into paroli

They do come with bugs and issues sometimes critical like today when paroli hangs because a resource in the framework is not available at paroli launch. This will be gone tomorrow.

- Fixed lots of bugs and issues such as:
-- unicode in message reading
-- loading messages from the SIM and saving incoming messages in the 
phone automatically
-- made all our lists automatically react to changes in items etc
-- gui issues such as the PIN dialog
-- got rid of the green topbar  ;) 
-- muting ringtone on incoming call
-- muting call in call (also as of tomorrow again)

- moved most of the Milestone two tickets[1] to testing

and

- were feverishly working on the stuff for the next milestone[2]

What are we planning to do next?

- keep on fixing issues in MS2
- continue working towards MS3
- get the kbd to match paroli on the image
- get messaging and contacts up and running as soon as possible to allow 
brave testers to use paroli daily ... any volnteers ?  ;)

==Installation==

kernel:
http://downloads.freesmartphone.org/fso-stable/milestone5/om-gta02/uImage-om-gta02-latest.bin

image:

In order to get the package from experimental you'll need to add a file:

create a file in the '''/etc/opkg''' folder with the content:

src/gz openmoko-experimental-armv4t 
http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/experimental/armv4t

Then do an opkg-update and opkg install paroli .

This should get you the newest version.

==Downloads==

You can downloads paroli  from :
