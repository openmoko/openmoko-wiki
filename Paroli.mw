Paroli a phone application for the Openmoko phones.

Originally it was planned to be released with [[Om2009]] distribution but as OM2009 developement slowed down, Paroli was also compiled for [[SHR]]

Paroli is based on top of the [[OpenmokoFramework|FSO framework]] and enables the use of it via a core and several services.

For more information please visit [http://www.paroli-project.org/ Paroli website]

== Stuff that works ==

Paroli actually makes FR a simple, very working phone!!
* ability to turn off PIN check & change pin! (The first distro that does it ?)
* Connecting to WLAN (with WPA, WPA2, WEP)
* suspend & resume
* etc etc

==Installation / download ==

=== Paroli on SHR unstable ===
 If you want to try and run paroli in SHR unstable RFN. Flash the latest shr-unstable image from http://shr.bearstech.com/shr-unstable/images/om-gta02/. 

The image from 08-08-09 has a minor problem with opkg. to fix it

 opkg-cl update
 opkg-cl upgrade

then install paroli

 opkg install paroli

Fix the conf files that the paroli installer messes with ( I hope to fix the recipe in the next couple of days. )

 cp /etc/old_frameworkd.conf /etc/frameworkd.conf
 cp /etc/freesmartphone/oevents/old_rules.yaml /etc/freesmartphone/oevents/rules.yaml

now if you want to disable the shr phone apps without removing them comment all of the lines out in

 /etc/X11/Xsession.d/89notifier and /etc/X11/Xsession.d/80ophonekitd

if you want the bind-home to ease upgrades add this line to fstab.

 /media/card/bind-home   /home/root     none        bind                   0  0

You should now have a functional paroli on SHR setup. Once you have a working setup it might be better not to run opkg upgrades but only upgrade specific packages when needed.

=== Paroli on OM2009 ===

To install the [[Om2009]] distribution download the uImage and fso-paroli-image from http://downloads.openmoko.org/distro/testing/NeoFreerunner/

=== Only the package ===
In order to get the package from unstable you'll need to adjust the configuration of opkg:

 <nowiki>echo src/gz openmoko-unstable-armv4t http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/unstable/armv4t > /etc/opkg/om-unstable.conf</nowiki>

Then do an opkg-update and opkg install paroli.

This should get you the newest version.

===What's beyond the main menu?===
Check "how do I change the theme" below. By default, the display is set to 'paroli' which gives Paroli a full window, but you can change the theme so that you can access other applications outside Paroli using Illume.

===How do I get to settings?===

Go to the home-screen (the one with the big clock) and hold the AUX-button pressed for 2 seconds.


===How do i get gprs to work? ===

Simpy click on Status in Settings - gprs, it toggles from unregistered to active.

===How do I change the theme (Illume / Paroli / Paroli-serenity)?===
Open settings, click on "display" and then hit "profile". This will change the profile to the next: after some rumbling on the screen you will have the new theme activated.
* ''paroli'' = Paroli fullscreen
* ''illume'' = Paroli windowed, Illume bar on top
* ''paroli-serenity'' = Paroli windowed, black Illume bar on top

To change to paroli-serenity on command line, run:
 DISPLAY=:0 mdbus org.enlightenment.wm.service /org/enlightenment/wm/RemoteObject org.enlightenment.wm.Profile.Set paroli-serenity

===How do I shut it down?===

To turn off Paroli, use the Illume top bar: click the bar when running Paroli and click on the red X to shut down Paroli.

To kill it from command line:
 pkill paroli

To turn of the whole phone, hold the power button down for 10 seconds. It will not give you a visual feedback, it just starts shutting down.

===How do I change the audio profile?===

* When not on call, short pressing of AUX changes between audio profiles (default / silent).
* When on call, it changes the speaker volume (20-40-60-80-100%). Using level over 80 might cause some echo.

===How do I close an application?===
When illume or paroli-serenity theme is activated (see above), clicking the top bar will show you 3 icons. The one in the right (the big X) closes the current app.
