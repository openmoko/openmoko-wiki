In a few words one could say: paroli is a new approach to application development on the openmoko phones.
Paroli is based on top of the fso framework and enables the use of it via a core and several services.

In order to get the package from experimental you'll need to add a file:

create a file in the '''/etc/opkg''' folder with the content:

src/gz openmoko-experimental-armv4t 
http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/experimental/armv4t

Then do an opkg-update and opkg install paroli .

This should get you the newest version.
