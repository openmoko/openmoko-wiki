== Overview ==
The application will know our location (work, home, etc.) by comparing your current GPS coordinates to your list of tagged locations. When you are at a location and you have nothing to do you can open Idle Hands and it will randomly select a small task that is appropriate to that location.
* Tasks can have multiple tags. For example, "clean mouse ball" might be appropriate for both work and home.
* The user should be able to hit a next bottom to skip the currently listed task. This is a Finger-Based application.

== Use Cases ==
* I might list the following as work tasks: fill stapler, empty trash bin, clean mouse ball, wipe off monitor. This way when a meeting gets pushed back five minutes I don't have to sit around and doing nothing. I can fire up Idle hands, which will randomly provide me with a small task I can do. This is good because I'd rather refill my stapler when I have nothing else to do than in the middle of stapling a stack of things.

== Layout Components ==
=== Application Area ===
* ''Describe the layout of the application and any important modes''

=== Footer Area ===
==== Status Bar ====
* ''Describe what is displayed''

== Constraints ==
* ''Describes limitations and available of functional aspects''

== Sessions ==
* Each task might also have a property stating how much time should pass before it is randomly selected again. For example, if today is Friday and I cleaned my mouse ball on Monday, that task should not come up.

== Architectural Details ==
* ''Items to clear up non-trivial functionality. For instance, diagrams for event / communication flow, data structures, timing details, etc...''

<blockquote>
''Use and reference open standards whenever appropriate''
</blockquote>

== Implementation Recommendations ==
* ''Recommendations on libraries, data structures, etc.. for implementation''

<blockquote>
''Use and reference open standards whenever appropriate''
</blockquote>

== Interactions ==
* ''Details of any cross-application interactions''

== Unresolved Issues ==
* ''List any unresolved issues, topics, functionality, etc...''

== Questions and Answers ==
* ''List very common questions with their answers here. Everything else should use the Wiki's discussion feature.''
