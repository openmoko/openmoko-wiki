{{Application|Wlan}}

Wlan is an application to manage wireless connection on the Freerunner.

== Where can I download Wlan? ==

Wlan is available [http://www.opkg.org/package_129.html HERE] on the Opkg.org website.

or alternatively, if you are using a Debian based distribution, get the '''.deb package''' from http://www.siticompulsi.net/openmoko/wlan_0.3-1_all.deb

See [[ #Installation ]] for info on how to install Wlan..

== More Information ==

Wlan main advantage and difference from other wifi connection managers, is that it's totally customizable in 5 minutes by anybody since it doesn't use any particular language but only bash. It has a very simple GUI to simplify its use. It supports: NO KEY, WEP, WPA, WPA2.

== Using Wlan ==

Once the program has been installed you can find its icon on your screen and clicking on it you can launch the application.
If Wlan isn't running a WLAN START icon appears, on the contrary when you have an already established wireless connection on four Freerunner you should see a different WLAN STOP icon. Even if the program closes correctly the connection and does a proper shutdown of eth0 interface, sometimes it occurs that the battery runs dry faster than normal after having used this app, I'm still trying to understand why this happens...however I know this is a common behavior of the wireless interface and you can see it with other similar programs too.

== Installation ==

=== Through opkg ===

Normally a simple:

opkg install http://buildhost.automated.it/OM2007.2/packages/armv4t/zenity_2.20.1-r0_armv4t.ipk http://www.opkg.org/packages/wlan_0.3_arm.ipk

is enough to install this program.

If you are running SHR you can find missing depndencies (wmiconfig and libnotify) in the UNSTABLE repo:

=== Debian based distro ===

As said above you can find a .deb package [http://www.siticompulsi.net/openmoko/wlan_0.3-1_all.deb HERE]

== Configuration ==

Wlan requires to store the wpa_supplicant configuration files in a directory called ~/.wpa_wlan with name following this simple rule:
wpa_supp_<ESSID_NAME> , i.e., wpa_supp_home, wpa_supp_work etc.

Sample config files for NO_KEY/WEP/WPA/WPA2 are stored in /etc/wlan and the software copy them automatically if it doesn't find them in the proper directory when you start the program for the first time. From then on you only need to modify them depending on your needs.
