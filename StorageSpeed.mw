Here is the result of a little speed test I ([[User:Sybren|sybren]]) performed on the NAND and my 2 GB micro-SD card:

SD (Transcend 2GB uSD card):

 root@moko ~ $ hdparm -tT /dev/mmcblk0p2
 
 /dev/mmcblk0p2:
  Timing cached reads:    46 MB in  2.05 seconds =  22.45 MB/sec
 HDIO_DRIVE_CMD(null) (wait for flush complete) failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device
  Timing buffered disk reads:    4 MB in  4.54 seconds = 902.06 kB/sec
 HDIO_DRIVE_CMD(null) (wait for flush complete) failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device

NAND:

 root@moko ~ $ hdparm -tT /dev/mtdblock6
 
 /dev/mtdblock6:
  Timing cached reads:    50 MB in  2.06 seconds =  24.26 MB/sec
 HDIO_DRIVE_CMD(null) (wait for flush complete) failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device
  Timing buffered disk reads:    6 MB in  3.20 seconds =   1.88 MB/sec
 HDIO_DRIVE_CMD(null) (wait for flush complete) failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device

So it appears that the NAND (/dev/mtdblock6) is roughly twice as fast as the SD card. The test was run on a Neo Freerunner (hardware revision A6) using SHR Unstable, kernel 2.6.29-rc3. Wifi and GSM were enabled, and the device was hooked up to my desktop computer using USB. GPS was disabled, as was GPRS.
