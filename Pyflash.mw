=Description=
[[Image:Pyflash.png]] This is a flashcard application written in PyGTK for learning words, sentences and other factual data. It supports UTF-8 and has been successfully tested with Japanese, Arabic and Devanagri (Nepali and Hindi) characters. It also runs on all desktops and laptops that have PyGTK installed. For download, see [http://www.opkg.org/package_198.html package at OPKG.org] and [https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyflash/ project at SourceForge].

To get to the source, see [http://pyflash.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/pyflash/pyflash/src/usr/share/pyflash/pyflash.py?view=markup SVN] or download the opk file and do an 'ar x pyflash.opk', then you will get a bunch a files. One of them is a .tar.gz which holds the source code. for the moment, this is the only way to get to the source.

Note that the 'Open' button is disabled in fullscreen mode, because the popup will be in the background and user is unable to control the dialog that has the current focus.

Default kanjidic-g1 will be loaded. The application will store the latest deck path in ~/.pyflashrc and if this file is available, it that deck path will be used as default.

=Format=
An example of the versatile format based upon [http://www.polarcloud.com/kanji Remembering the Kanji] is given here:

口;N868 U53E3;S3 G1 F284 口:mouth:コウ、ク、くち

日;N2097 U65E5;S4 G1 F1 日:day|sun|Japan:ニチ、ジツ、ひ、-び、-か

癒;N3081 U7652;S18 G8 F1667 疒:healing|cure|quench (thirst)|wreak:ユ、い(える)、いや(す)

The part before the first : is the question. There, the characters before the first ; is the actual question. e.g. 口 or 日. Other characters of that part form the explanation of the question. Extra ; in there will trigger a new line in the explanation as can be seen in the screenshots. The part in between the middle two : is the answer and the part after the last : is the explanation or pronunciation of the answer.

Note that the answer and pronunciation will only appear after tapping the text area of the application. Here the explanation of the question is used to flood the screen with all sort of data, e.g. U53E3 is the unicode ID and the kanji at the end is the radical used for quick look up in dictionaries.
