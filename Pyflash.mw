=Description=
[[Image:Pyflash.png]] This is a flashcard application written in PyGTK for learning words, sentences and other factual data. It supports UTF-8 and has been successfully tested with Japanese, Arabic and Devanagri (Nepali and Hindi) characters. It also runs on all desktops and laptops that have PyGTK installed. For download, see [http://www.opkg.org/package_198.html package at OPKG.org] and [https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyflash/ project at SourceForge].

To get to the source, download the opk file and do an 'ar x pyflash.opk', then you will get a bunch a files. One of them is a .tar.gz which holds the source code. for the moment, this is the only way to get to the source.

Note that the 'Open' button is disabled in fullscreen mode, because the popup will be in the background and user is unable to control the dialog that has the current focus.

=Format=
An example of the versatile format based upon [http://www.polarcloud.com/kanji Remembering the Kanji] is given here:

口;N868 NN685 KL2119 U53E3;RK11 S3 G1 F284 R30 口:mouth:コウ、ク、くち

日;N2097 NN2410 KL1915 U65E5;RK12 S4 G1 F1 R72 日:day,sun,Japan:ニチ、ジツ、ひ、-び、-か

癒;N3081 NN3847 KL2070 U7652;RK2037 S18 G8 F1667 R104 疒:healing,cure,quench (thirst),wreak:ユ、い(える)、いや(す)

The part before the first : is the question. There, the characters before the first ; is the actual question. e.g. 口 or 日. Other characters of that part form the explanation of the question. Extra ; in there will trigger a new line in the explaination as can be seen in the screenshots. The part in between the middle two : is the answer and the part after the last : is the explanation or pronunciation of the answer.

Note that the answer and pronunciation will only appear after tapping the text area of the application. Here the explanation of the question is used to flood the screen with all sort of data which is used in by Remembering the Kanji. E.g. U53E3 is the unicode ID and the kanji at the end is the radical used for quick lookup in dictionaries.
