Note that the 'Open' button is disabled in fullscreen mode, because the popup will be in the background and user is unable to control the dialog that has the current focus.

==Format==
An example of the versatile format based upon [http://www.polarcloud.com/kanji Remebering the Kanji] is given here:

口;N868 NN685 KL2119 U53E3;RK11 S3 G1 F284 R30 口:mouth:コウ、ク、くち

日;N2097 NN2410 KL1915 U65E5;RK12 S4 G1 F1 R72 日:day,sun,Japan:ニチ、ジツ、ひ、-び、-か

The part before the first : is the question. There, the characters before the first ; is the actual question. e.g. 口 or 日. Other characters of that part form the explanation of the question. Extra ; in there will trigger a new line in the explaination as can be seen in the screenshots. The part in between the middle two : is the answer and the part after the last : is the explanation or pronunciation of the answer.

Note that the answer and pronunciation will only appear after tapping the text area of the application.
