A few of us would like to start a usability team and formal user centered design process on Openmoko's UI.

Rather than put together a formal road map, I'm going to simply put forward a few ideas where we can begin. This is Phase I of the User Centered Design process (the discovery phase). Listed are just the outputs, not the steps involved to produce them. 

== Phase 1 ==

# User profiles & persona describing our user groups (about 5 - 7 profiles & persona)
#* [[Usability Team/User Categories]]
#* [[Personas]]
# Review competitive landscape
# Usage scenarios, usage goals, task analysis
# Usability testing on existing solution with the people who fit the profiles and the items outlined in #3

== Phase 2 ==
