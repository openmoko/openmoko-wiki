* Fuzzy typing: you only have to touch near each letter that you want, not exactly on it.
* Sliding your finger left is backspace.
* Sliding your finger right is space.
* Sliding your finger up/down changes between lowercase/uppercase/numbers/special characters.
* Hovering over a letter for more than 2 seconds activates zoom mode, allowing you to type specific letters without prediction.

=== Writing something ===

If the keyboard pops up, just write someting. Each time you touch the screen, with your finger or with the stylus, the keyboard remembers all of the letters that are near where you touched. Then, after each touch, it matches all of the possible letter combinations against words in the dictionary, and shows the matching words above the keyboard, with the most common match in the middle. If you click on this word (or slide the finger over the keyboard to the right), it will be transfered to the cursor position in the input field that is currently selected. If you want one of the matches other than the most common one, use your finger (or stylus) to scroll the matches bar to the left or right, then click when the match that you want is in the middle.

If there are no words in the dictionary that match the touches so far, the keyboard shows a word (regardless of whether it actually makes sense) that is just the sequence of letters closest to each touch. 

Note that although this keyboard is often referred to as "predictive", it is not predictive in the sense of guessing further letters, to complete a word, beyond the ones that you have already typed.

===Deleting text ===
To delete the word you have typed before you transferred it to the input box, you can erase it by simply sliding your finger left on the keyboard (this writes a backspace, see below)

=== Changing keyboard layout ===

The keyboard only displays a subset of the available keys at any one time.  To change the keyboard layout to access additional keys slide your finger up or down directly on the keyboard. You have to do this fast that the zoom will not be activated.

The default layout when the keyboard is displayed is the lowercase alphabet but this may be overwritten by the application bringing up the keyboard. 

=== Where is the Backspase or Space character? ===
You can input a space or backspace by simply sliding with your finger left or right. Sliding left on the keyboard gives you an backspace, sliding right writes a space.
Note that to delete a character inside the input box, the word guessing box needs to be empty. If it is not empty, the backspace will first delete the box and you need to slide your finger left again. If something is inside the guessing box, a right-slide will transfer the typed stuff to the input box currently selected (this is the same as clicking onto the typed word).

=== Keyboard Zoom ===

If you hover your finger (or stylus) over a letter for more than 2 seconds a magnifiying glass, or zoom mode is displayed that allows you to see the letter you are selecting. This also overrides the prediction feature for this letter, so you can type specific letters with this method.

= Customizations =

As it behaves in the shipped 2008.8 state, this keyboard doesn't suit all users.

== Debate ==

Some people don't like this keyboard, because it lacks a full Qwerty keyboard. Another issue people have, is they can't switch the keyboard prediction off.

For a description of alternative solutions and potential workarounds, see [[Keyboard Debate]].

Also, bellow are some (more ?) customizations/tweaks/hacks proposed by some users :

== Reactivating The Keyboard Toggle ==
Most applications should bring up the keyboard automatically when keyboard input is required. However, one can have a small 'qwerty' button which can manually toggle the keyboard on and off.  See the [[Keyboard_Toggle|keyboard toggle tutorial]] for more information.

== Using the Full Qwerty keyboard ==
