== Keyboard guide ==
ASU features several keyboard layouts. There is the lower case alphabet, the uppercase alphabet, only numbers and finally special chars.
Also it features some auto-word recognition that trys to guess the word you try to type wich allows for more speedy inputs.

=== Writing something ===
If the keyboard pops up, just write someting. The word recognition will try to guess the next inputs and displays the word it thinks you want to write. If you click on this word (or slide the finger over the keyboard to the right), it will be transfered to the cursor position in the input field that is currently selected. This is also true if the word recognition cant guess what you are typing in which case it just displays the typed characters.

To delete the word you have typed before you transferred it to the input box, you can erase it by simply sliding your finger left on the keyboard (this writes a backspace, see below)

=== Changing keyboard layout ===
The default is lowercase alphabvet but this may be overwritten by the application bringing up the keyboard. If you need to toggle the keaboard, you can do this by sliding with your finger up or down directly on the keyboard.

=== Where is the Backspase or Space character? ===
You can input a space or backspace by simply sliding with your finger left or right. Sliding left on the keyboard gives you an backspace, sliding right writes a space.
Note that to delete a character inside the input box, the word guessing box needs to be empty. If it is not empty, the backspace will first delete the box and you need to slide your finger left again. If something is inside the guessing box, a right-slide will transfer the typed stuff to the input box currently selected (this is the same as clicking onto the typed word).

== Reactivating Keyboard toggle ==
There used to be a small "qwerty" button in the top menu that disappeared in ASU release of 2008-08-08 and brought up the keyboard if pressed.

The page [[ASU_Keyboard_Toggle]] describes how to get that toggle back, however, most applications should bring up the keyboard automatically.
