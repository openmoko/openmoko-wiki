== Customizations ==

As it behaves in the shipped 2008.8 state, this keyboard doesn't suit all users.

=== Debate ===

Some people don't like this keyboard, because it lacks a full Qwerty keyboard. Another issue people have, is they can't switch the keyboard prediction off.

For a description of alternative solutions and potential workarounds, see [[Keyboard Debate]].

Also, bellow are some (more ?) customizations/tweaks/hacks proposed by some users :

=== Reactivating The Keyboard Toggle ===
Most applications should bring up the keyboard automatically when keyboard input is required. However, one can have a small 'qwerty' button which can manually toggle the keyboard on and off.  See the [[Keyboard_Toggle|keyboard toggle tutorial]] for more information.

=== Using the Full Qwerty keyboard ===
