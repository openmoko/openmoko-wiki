Alternate case for the Neo1973, with a secure method for storing the stylus when not in use.

==Design options==
1. The stylus is pushed end-on into a round hole slightly larger than the stylus and retained by a spring-loaded clip at the end.<br>
2. The stylus is stored by pushing laterally into a C-section clip.<br>
3. The stylus is attached to the lanyard (while low cost/simple, the stylus is relatively delicate - this may not be suitable)
