Alternate case for the Neo1973, with a secure method for storing the stylus when not in use.

==Design options==
1. The stylus is pushed end-on into a round hole slightly larger than the stylus and retained by a spring-loaded clip at the end.<br>
1a.A microswitch inside the stylus sleeve triggers power on/wake from hibernate when the stylus is removed (via an ACPI event, likely)<br>
* A switch could also be used to change the mode of operation of the device, i.e. when the stylus is pulled out, more options become available - options that would be too small to control by fingers.
2. The stylus is stored by pushing laterally into a C-section clip.<br>
3. The stylus is attached to the lanyard (while low cost/simple, the stylus is relatively delicate - this may not be suitable)

|-
|17.||[[User:Sin|Sin]] - at least for me, losing the stylus is quite possible

|19.||[[User:Jackcday|Jackcday]] - Mda Vario has a cool telescoping stylus which allows for smaller stylus, but it gets bigger when you remove it.

|21. ||[[User:oz1lln|oz1lln]] - automatic startup of the device, when pulling out the stylus,  would be great

|-
|23.||[[User:wurstwolf|wurstwolf]] - sending an event when pulling out the stylus would be great, that would offer the possibility to configure the phones behaviour. My favourite would be the deactivation of the phones keylock, but that's a software idea ;)

|-
|27.||[[User:snizfast|snizfast]] - A protective case with a stylus holster would also work.
