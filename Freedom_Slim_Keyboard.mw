[[Image:Neo_slimkb.JPG|right|200px|thumb|Neo and Slim Kbd]]
Use 
 hcitool scan
 hcitool dev
to know the ID of you remote and local devices

== Bluez 4 method ==
Turn bluetooth on 
 mdbus -s org.freesmartphone.ousaged /org/freesmartphone/Usage org.freesmartphone.Usage.SetResourcePolicy "Bluetooth" "enabled"
simple-agent can be found  on http://git.kernel.org/?p=bluetooth/bluez.git;a=blob_plain;f=test/simple-agent;hb=HEAD" 
remember to chmod +x simple-agent
 simple-agent hci0 $REMOTE_BT_DEVICE_ID
Enter the pin code in console
Enter the  pin code in device
simple agent will return the rute to new device paired 
change /org/bluez/3207/hci0/dev_00_18_00_00_C2_37 with yours
 mdbus -s org.bluez /org/bluez/3207/hci0/dev_00_18_00_00_C2_37 org.bluez.Input.Connect

== Bluez 3 method ==

 echo "$REMOTE_BT_DEVICE_ID $PINCODE" > /var/lib/bluetooth/$LOCAL_BT_DEVICE_ID/pincodes
 dbus-send --system --type=method_call --print-reply --dest=org.bluez /org/bluez/hci0 org.bluez.Adapter.CreateBonding string:$REMOTE_BT_DEVICE_ID
put the pincode in the keyboard 
 hidd --connect $REMOTE_BT_DEVICE_ID 


== Test on Distributions ==
=== OM2008.12 (works) ===
bluez dbus totally broken unable to pair using passkey-agent or CreateBonding method
see https://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/2218
workarround install bluez4

 opkg install python-pygobject
 opkg install -force-depends -force-overwrite http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/feeds/2008/ipk/glibc/armv4t/base/bluez4_4.31-r3.1_armv4t.ipk
 /etc/init.d/dbus-1 stop
 /etc/init.d/bluethooth stop
 /etc/init.d/dbus-1 start
 /etc/init.d/bluetooth start
 hciconfig hci0 up
proceed with bluez4 method but last line will be 
 dbus-send --system --type=method_call --print-reply --dest=org.bluez /org/bluez/789/hci0/dev_00_18_00_00_C2_37 org.bluez.Input.Connect

tested on openmoko-terminal2 and Message app. keyboard works fine but with issue #1

=== FSO 5.1(not work) ===
Use bluez 4 method
The bonding is created succesfully but on X seems to not recive anything but if you shutdown X
 /etc/init.d/xserver-nodm stop
the console is recibing the keystrokes but is printing garbage
old https://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1796 bug????

=== SHR testing(works) ===
Use bluez 4 method
tested on teminal keyboard works fine but with issue1 

=== Hackable1(works) ===
Use bluez 3 method
tested on openmoko-terminal2 and Abiword keyboard works fine but with issue1 

=== FYP 3.01(works) ===
Downloaded from http://opensvn.csie.org/fyp/releases/3.01/
apt-get update
apt-get install bluez-utils
Use bluez 3 method
tested on teminal keyboard works fine but with issue1

=== Android Koolu beta-3(not work) ===

 Bluethoth scan detects the keyboard and starts the pin dialog but the software keyboard is unable to reach meanwhile the dialog is open so unable to put the pin code

=== Android Michael Trimarchi uImagev13+freerunnerV14.6(not work) ===
Downladed from http://www.fragcom.de/android
Bluethoth scan  doesn't detect anything seems afected by the dialog issue too

=== QT extended 4.3.3(not work) ===
Use bluez 3 method
Download from http://dashi-x02.karadog.net/~lihouyu/qtextended/4.4.3/
Paired successfully trough gui and shh console usin bluez 3 method
GUI doesn't respond to keystrokes but if you shutdown qtextended you can se the typed chars in the black screen below

=== Debian (not tested) ===
has not been tested but I supose the result will be the same as Hackable1/FYP

== Issues ==
=== issue 1 ===
Just the fn+number_keys simbols don't work it print always "~" simbol but keystrokes 
are detected so maybe a good keyboard remap will do help on this will be apreciated
