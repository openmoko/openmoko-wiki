{{Application|XBill}}

The classical game, as original author describes: You're a sysadmin, and someone's trying to destroy your computers. The little people running around the screen are trying to infect your computers with Wingdows [TM], a virus cleverly designed to resemble a popular operating system.

== Installing ==

Using [[Toolchain]] you can compile XBill from the official source code. Make sure you do NOT have a "gtk-config" in your path on your host OS while compiling, otherwise that will add the GTK include paths of your PC and linking will fail.

Get the source:

 mypc$ wget http://www.xbill.org/download/xbill-2.1.tar.gz
 mypc$ tar -xzvf xbill-2.1.tar.gz

Compile with your Toolchain tools, this will install the required Athena library into your Toolchain setup. (You must do the <tt>opkg-target install</tt> part as root, unless you changed the owner of /usr/local/openmoko to your own user! These commands are part of the [[Toolchain]].)

 mypc$ . /usr/local/openmoko/arm/setup-env
 mypc$ opkg-target install libxaw-dev
 mypc$ om-conf --enable-athena
 mypc$ cd xbill-2.1
 mypc$ make

On Openmoko you need Athena again and a directory for XBill pixmaps:

 om-gta02$ opkg install libxaw
 om-gta02$ mkdir /usr/share/xbill
 
Copy to your Openmoko:

 mypc$ scp xbill root@192.168.0.202:/usr/bin
 mypc$ scp -r pixmaps root@192.168.0.202:/usr/share/xbill
 mypc$ scp -r bitmaps root@192.168.0.202:/usr/share/xbill

== Desktop icon ==

Here is an example desktop entry. Create a file called "/usr/share/applications/xbill.desktop" with content:

<pre>
[Desktop Entry]
Version=2.1
Type=Application
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=XBill
Comment=XBill
Exec=/usr/bin/xbill --size 470
Icon=drm/Drm.png
Categories=Application;Games
Terminal=false
</pre>

== Further improvements ==

Building against GTK+ would be cool. You could try <tt>om-conf --enable-gtk</tt>, but ./configure will either unable to find <tt>gtk-config</tt> or it will use the host OS <tt>gtk-config</tt>, so it won't work. Please extend this documentation if you know how to build against GTK+.

Please send comments or questions about this installation guide to [[:User:Kempelen]]. Please extend this artcile if you think something is missing.

== Bugs ==

* Dragged items are not visible (but they work). (For example when you drag the bucket to a sparc.)
* Windows could fit nicer (hopefully a GTK+ build will fix that).
* Can't type in player name for high-scores.
