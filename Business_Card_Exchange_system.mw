'''Short description''':

The purpose of this project is to allow the mobile user to exchange the business card via Bluetooth. We often forget to bring the card or run short of cards. With this system, the user only need to edit the card and save it as a png file. The users can then exchange their cards via bluetooth communication channel. In this way we will never run short of cards.
