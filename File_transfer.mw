The Openmoko hardware and software offer several ways to transfer files to and from the system.

== SCP ==
client (find host pc ip-adress: scp <hostLoginName>@<hostIP>:/file .)

server (on host pc: 'scp <file> root@192.168.0.202:/tmp/')

== TFTP ==
client ('tftp')

server?

== NFS ==
client (on Neo: 'mount -t nfs ...' or edit /etc/fstab and '/etc/init.d/mountnfs.sh start')

server?

== HTTP ==
client (on Neo: 'wget',web browser)

== MicroSD ==
It is possible to write data to micro SD on a desktop machine with the suitable writer and then have it accessible from inside the OpenMoko after the card is inserted into that device. To get this working, the micro SD must be formatted in some filesystem that both OpenMoko and host understand (ext2, for instance). 

The problem with this approach is that micro SD is difficult to access in the Neo. Both  battery and even SIM card must be removed to reach it.

== SFTP ==
SFTP can be an excellent way to transfer files as it is supported by many possible clients on the desktop machine. After USB network is set up, it is possible to try to open sftp connection by entering sftp://192.168.0.202 into the address bar of the browser that supports sftp. 

The user name on the local host must match the name of the existing user account on the device, and the user password field must not be empty. 

== FTP ==
FTP is currently considered insecure. There is no any reason to use FTP, SFTP should be used instead.

== Common methods not supported ==
*Bluetooth (except via other network methods)
*USB (appearing as a mass storage device on the other device).
