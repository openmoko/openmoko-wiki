S3C2410 Steppingstone是一个能够使得S3C2410直接从NAND闪存引导的特殊的4KB大缓冲区。

Basically some hidden microcode in the S3C2410 takes care of copying the first 4KB of NAND flash into RAM, and re-mapping the first SDRAM page from 0x30000000 to 0x00000000.

The bootloader then needs to have some code to load the remaining bootloader code from NAND before executing itself.
