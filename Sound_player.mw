There are several sound players available:


== [[mplayer]] ==

Can play not only sound but also video. A slow starter and quick to stop. You may want to combine madplay and aplay - aplay can read wave data from stdin (e.g. from madplay).

== [[madplay]] ==

Quick to start but slow to stop.
Supported output formats:
  cdda    CD audio, 16-bit big-endian 44100 Hz stereo PCM (*.cdr, *.cda)
  aiff    Audio IFF, [16-bit] PCM (*.aif, *.aiff)
  wave    Microsoft RIFF/WAVE, [16-bit] PCM (*.wav)
  snd     Sun/NeXT audio, 8-bit ISDN mu-law (*.au, *.snd)
  raw     binary [16-bit] host-endian linear PCM
  hex     ASCII hexadecimal [24-bit] linear PCM
  esd     Enlightened Sound Daemon [16-bit] (give speaker host as PATH)
  null    no output (decode only)



== [[aplay]] ==

Quick to start and quick to stop.
Supported file types:
  voc
  wav
  raw
  au

Use this soundplayer if you want minimal latency.
To go clear of underrun error buffer size should be a multiple of period size:
<code>
aplay --period-size=2000 --buffer-size=10000 alarm.wav
</code>
