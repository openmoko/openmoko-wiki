To get wlan working on your Freerunner, you can follow these steps:

1. create and edit a suitable /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf   (use your favourite search engine to find the syntax)

2. execute 
 ifup eth0

3. execute
 wpa_supplicant -ieth0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf -B
(-B for running as daemon)

4. get a IP via dhcp: 
 udhcpc eth0

That's it, your wlan should now work!

==Using /etc/network/interfaces==

Another way is to use /etc/network/interfaces

For instance, for WEP:

* Using wireless tools:

 iface eth0 inet dhcp
    wireless-key my_wep_key
    wireless-essid my_essid

* Using wpa_supplicant (this allows more authentication methods).

 iface eth0 inet dhcp
    wpa-wep-key0 my_wep_key
    wpa-key-mgmt NONE
    wpa-ssid my_essid

Using a wpa_supplicant.conf file:
 iface eth0 inet dhcp
    wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

Then just run:
 ifup eth0

You'll get a lot of messages, like <tt>ioctl[SIOCSIWENCODEEXT]: Operation not supported</tt> and <tt>sed: unrecognized option `--quiet'</tt>, they appear to be harmless. The "--quiet" error message can be avoided by replacing "sed --quiet" with "sed -n" in /etc/wpa_supplicant/*.sh

== Known good wpa-supplicant version? ==

Is the 0.6.3-r1 broken? I don't get anything to work with these instructions via usage of wpa_supplicant, but WEP works via direct interfaces changes (wireless-essid/wireless-key settings).

== Sample wpa_supplicant.conf ==

 ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
 eapol_version=1
 ap_scan=1
 
 # WPA2:
 network={
        ssid="your ssid"
        scan_ssid=1
        # WPA-PSK started working for me after commenting out the "proto" option
        #proto=RSN
        key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
        pairwise=CCMP TKIP
        group=TKIP CCMP
        psk="secret key"
        priority=50
 }
 
 # WPA:
 network={
       ssid="your_ssid"
       scan_ssid=1
       psk="secret key"
       priority=10
 }
 
 # WEP:
 network={
      ssid="your_ssid"
      scan_ssid=1
      key_mgmt=NONE
      wep_tx_keyidx=0
      wep_key0="secret key"
      priority=8
 }
 
 # Open:
 network={
      ssid="your ssid"
      key_mgmt=NONE
      priority=5
 }

== A very ugly /etc/init.d/wlan startscript ==
 #!/bin/sh
 #
 # wlan	This shell script starts and stops wlan.
 #
 # processname: wlan
 
 # Source function library.
 #. /etc/rc.d/init.d/functions
 # "written" by HdR
 
 RETVAL=0
 prog="wlan"
 
 # test -f /etc/default/$prog && . /etc/default/$prog
 
 start() {
 	echo -n "Starting $prog: "
 	ifconfig eth0 up
 	wpa_supplicant -ieth0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf -B
 	sleep 10
 	udhcpc eth0
 	RETVAL=$?
 	return $RETVAL
 }
 
 stop() {
 	# Stop daemons.
 	echo -n "Shutting down $prog: "
         killall wpa_supplicant
 	ifconfig eth0 down
 #        killproc gpsd
 	RETVAL=$?
 	return $RETVAL
 }
 
 # See how we were called.
 case "$1" in
   start)
 	start
 	;;
   stop)
 	stop
 	;;
   restart|reload)
 	stop
 	start
 	RETVAL=$?
 	;;
   *)
 	echo "Usage: $0 {start|stop|restart}"
 	exit 1
 esac
 
 exit $RETVAL

== An alternative way to automate ==
Add the wpa_supplicant details to /etc/network/interfaces:

 iface eth0 inet dhcp
 wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

Now `ifup eth0` will start up wpa_supplicant and udhcpc for you, and `ifdown eth0` will stop them, in theory at least. In practise udhcpc can time out before wpa_supplicant has finished connecting to the access point, and if udhcpc has failed to get an address ifdown exits without stopping wpa_supplicant and bringing down the interface.

== Comments ==

The alternative method seems to work reliably on the FR/ GTA02, I couldn't get the manual method to work when WPA/PSK is involved. Also you must do ifdown usb0 before the ifup eth0. Then you also need to setup the resolv.conf manually as it does not seem to get the dns server from the dhcp server. If the dhcp fails during ifup eth0, then you can run udhcpc eth0 manually it usually gets the dhcp address the second time around.

I use a script called u...
 # u
 ifdown usb0
 ifup eth0 
 echo nameserver xx.xx.xx.xx >/etc/resolv.conf

This usually works


== Success stories ==

=== July 22, 2008 ===

wpa_supplicant 0.6.3-r1 works for me with WPA-PSK. After removing the "proto" option things started working (now mentioned in the sample config above). Unlike the comment above, udhcpc updates /etc/resolver.conf correctly for me. 

Bringing up wpa_supplicant manually or using "ifup eth0" with the wpa-conf option set in /etc/network/interfaces work for me. If usb0 was already up when running "ifup eth0" you'll end up with 2 default routes which can cause problems. To solve this either take usb0 down first or run "ip route del default dev usb0".

=== July 19, 2008 ===

I've had repeated success with:
 # ifconfig eth0 up
 # iwconfig eth0 essid any
 # iwconfig eth0 key '...'
 # iwconfig eth0 essid '...'
 # udhcpc eth0
 # ifconfig usb0 down; ifconfig usb0 up

Hope that helps someone. This is for WEP.

The following may be helpful in order to scan available networks :
 # iwlist eth0 scan
