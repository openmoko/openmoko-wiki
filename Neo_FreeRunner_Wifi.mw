To get wlan working on your Freerunner, you can follow these steps:

1. create and edit a suitable /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf   (use your favourite search engine to find the syntax)

2. execute `ifup eth0`

3. execute `wpa_supplicant -ieth0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf` (Add an & to run in the background)

4. get a IP via dhcp: `udhcpc eth0`

That's it, your wlan should now work!
