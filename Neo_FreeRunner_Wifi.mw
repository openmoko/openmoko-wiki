This page documents the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_networking wireless networking] solutions commonly known as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_LAN WLAN] or WiFi. 

There are other ways to enable wireless communications on the Neo, including [[Bluetooth]]. For Bluetooth solutions, see [[How to use bluetooth to transfer data between Neo and Desk-top]] and [[Manually using Bluetooth]].

=== Where is the GUI? ===

Good question. Right now this page is just a collection of tips on what command you can use in a terminal window or an ssh connection. The advantage is that these tips will (well -- ''should'') work on any Openmoko device.

Refer to the section below, [[#Available Software|"Available Software"]] to find out what else might be available.

== How can I tell what access points (AP's) are visible to me? ==

You can connect to wireless networks through wireless [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_point| access points]. If you want to know the names of all the access points that are currently visible to you, you can perform a scan with this command:

 root@om-gta02:~# '''iwlist eth0 scan'''

If anything is visible you will get a list that looks something like this:

 ''A picture is worth a thousand words. Add an example here.''

== Using WPA and /etc/network/interfaces==
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access| WPA] is a encryption method for securing your wireless network.
Once you have a [[GTA02_WLAN#Sample_wpa_supplicant.conf|/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf]] file, add a line under the eth0 entry in /etc/network/interfaces:
 iface eth0 inet dhcp
    wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

Save your changes and run:
  # ifdown eth0 && ifup eth0

You'll get a lot of messages, like <tt>ioctl[SIOCSIWENCODEEXT]: Operation not supported</tt> and <tt>sed: unrecognized option `--quiet'</tt>, they appear to be harmless. The "--quiet" error message can be avoided by replacing "sed --quiet" with "sed -n" in /etc/wpa_supplicant/*.sh

== Using WEP and /etc/network/interfaces==
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_Equivalent_Privacy| WEP] is an encryption method for securing your wireless network. WEP is generally considered to be weak, you should use WPA instead if possible.
  iface eth0 inet dhcp
    wireless-key my_wep_key
    wireless-essid my_essid

 iface eth0 inet dhcp
    wpa-wep-key0 my_wep_key
    wpa-key-mgmt NONE
    wpa-ssid my_essid

Save your changes and run:
  # ifdown eth0 && ifup eth0

== Manual attempt ==

Create and edit a suitable [[GTA02_WLAN#Sample_wpa_supplicant.conf|/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf]]   

 root@om-gta02:~# ifup eth0
 root@om-gta02:~# wpa_supplicant -ieth0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf -B
 root@om-gta02:~# udhcpc eth0

 # Open:

======wpa_supplicant.conf explained======
The highest priority is tried first then falls back to the next highest number.

priority=100  1st  <br>
then<br>
priority=99  <br> 
<pre> 

# Simple case: WPA-PSK, PSK as an ASCII passphrase, allow all valid ciphers
network={
	ssid="AP_ESSID"
	psk="presharedkey"
	priority=5
}


#try open AP regardless of its SSID.
# change root password before you go roaming around it could prove dangerous
network={
	key_mgmt=NONE
priority=1  #try any open AP last
}
</pre>

== Stability issues ==
=== 2nd of august 2008 ===
Using the above methods i can only get a succesful connection about every 10th time i try. I get an IP, but after that it is extremely unstable. Trying to ping www.google.com only results in an answer every 30 secs or so, and using the wifi connection for anything useful such as installing software using opkg is almost impossible. I've had these issues with two different FreeRunners and two different AP's. - El Senator

== Available Software ==

Here are some applications available to aid in WiFi administration:

=== lint-wifi ===
lint-wifi work in progress<br>

=== Mofi ===

Mofi is software for the OpenMoko platform allowing phone users to search for and connect to wireless access points within range.
