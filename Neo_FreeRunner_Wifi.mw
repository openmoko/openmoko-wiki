== What APs are available ==

 root@om-gta02:~# iwlist eth0 scan

== Using WPA and /etc/network/interfaces==

Once you have a [[GTA02_WLAN#Sample_wpa_supplicant.conf|/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf]] file, add a line under the eth0 entry in /etc/network/interfaces:
 iface eth0 inet dhcp
    wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

Save your changes and run:
  # ifdown eth0 && ifup eth0

You'll get a lot of messages, like <tt>ioctl[SIOCSIWENCODEEXT]: Operation not supported</tt> and <tt>sed: unrecognized option `--quiet'</tt>, they appear to be harmless. The "--quiet" error message can be avoided by replacing "sed --quiet" with "sed -n" in /etc/wpa_supplicant/*.sh

== Using WEP and /etc/network/interfaces==

  iface eth0 inet dhcp
    wireless-key my_wep_key
    wireless-essid my_essid

 iface eth0 inet dhcp
    wpa-wep-key0 my_wep_key
    wpa-key-mgmt NONE
    wpa-ssid my_essid

Save your changes and run:
  # ifdown eth0 && ifup eth0

== Manual attempt ==

Create and edit a suitable [[GTA02_WLAN#Sample_wpa_supplicant.conf|/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf]]   

 root@om-gta02:~# ifup eth0
 root@om-gta02:~# wpa_supplicant -ieth0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf -B

== Success stories ==

=== July 23, 2008 ===

wpa_supplicant 0.6.3-r1 works for me with WPA and WPA2 (with PSK) using the config file template on this page. Unlike the comment above, udhcpc is updating /etc/resolver.conf correctly for me (perhaps this is an old problem). 

Bringing up wpa_supplicant manually or using "ifup eth0" with the wpa-conf option set in /etc/network/interfaces works for me. If usb0 was already up when running "ifup eth0" you'll end up with 2 default routes which can cause problems. To solve this either take usb0 down first or run "ip route del default dev usb0" to remove the default route to usb0.

=== July 19, 2008 ===

I've had repeated success with:
 # ifconfig eth0 up
 # iwconfig eth0 essid any
 # iwconfig eth0 key '...'
 # iwconfig eth0 essid '...'
 # udhcpc eth0
 # ifconfig usb0 down; ifconfig usb0 up

Hope that helps someone. This is for WEP.

I've been able to connect to a variety of networks including WPA2 without too much difficulty.
Follow the above steps in configuring your wpa_supplicant.conf and adding the line to load the supplicant in /etc/network/interfaces.

My sample WPA2 configuration is as follows:
#WPA2
network={
  ssid="MY_SSID"
  scan_ssid=1
  proto=RSN
  key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
  pairwise=CCMP TKIP
  group=CCMP TKIP
  psk="PASSWORD_PRESHARED_KEY"
  priority=50
}

That configuration will allow you to connect to a WPA2-Personal network with TKIP key encryption.

The "ifup eth0" command will connect you via WiFi.  If you don't get a lease the first time, try again.  Sometimes the configuration is a little too slow and DHCP tries to get a lease before a successful connection to your access point has been established.



The following may be helpful in order to scan available networks :
 # iwlist eth0 scan
