This page documents the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_networking wireless networking] solutions commonly known as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_LAN WLAN] or WiFi. 

There are other ways to enable wireless communications on the Neo, including [[Bluetooth]]. For Bluetooth solutions, see [[How to use bluetooth to transfer data between Neo and Desk-top]] and [[Manually using Bluetooth]].

== Using the GUI on 2008.8 ==

In the Settings application on Om 2008.8, there's a "WiFi" item. It should work fairly well in stable-updated 2008.8 (even with WPA2).

If it says "WiFi unknown", you can delete the /etc/volatives.cache file and reboot.  It should work after that.[http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1734]  After connecting using the GUI, you may also need to run "udhcpc eth0" manually in the terminal to get DNS entries added to your resolv.conf.  You may also need to run "ifdown usb0" to remove the routing issue caused by having both interfaces up at the same time.  Some users have reported that 802.11g modulation needs to be enabled on APs to allow the FreeRunner to connect (The hardware is suppose to support 802.11b/g).

Otherwise there's also [[lint-wifi]].  Refer to the section below, [[#Available Software|"Available Software"]] to find out what else might be available.



== How can I tell what Access Points (APs) are visible to me? ==

You can connect to wireless networks through wireless [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_point| access points]. If you want to know the names of all the access points that are currently visible to you, you can perform a scan with this command:

 root@om-gta02:~# '''iwlist eth0 scan'''

If anything is visible you will get a list that looks something like this:

If you want to connect to an unsecured network run:
  
  udhcpc  


== WPA ==

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access  WPA] is an encryption method for securing your wireless network.

=== Using wpa_supplicant manually ===

Create and edit a suitable [[GTA02_WLAN#Sample_wpa_supplicant.conf|/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf (see below)]].

Bring up your wireless connection: 

 root@om-gta02:~# ifconfig eth0 up
 root@om-gta02:~# wpa_supplicant -i eth0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf -B
 root@om-gta02:~# udhcpc eth0

=== Using WPA and /etc/network/interfaces ===

Once you have a [[GTA02_WLAN#Sample_wpa_supplicant.conf|/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf (see below)]] file, add a line under the eth0 entry in /etc/network/interfaces:

 iface eth0 inet dhcp
    wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

Save your changes and run:
  # ifdown eth0 && ifup eth0

You'll get a lot of messages, like <tt>ioctl[SIOCSIWENCODEEXT]: Operation not supported</tt> and <tt>sed: unrecognized option `--quiet'</tt>, they appear to be harmless. The "--quiet" error message can be avoided by replacing "sed --quiet" with "sed -n" in /etc/wpa_supplicant/*.sh ([http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/2189 bug #2189])

=== wpa_supplicant.conf ===
<tt>wpa-supplicant</tt>'s conf file typically found at <tt>/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf</tt>.

==== wpa_supplicant.conf explained ====
The highest priority is tried first then falls back to the next highest number.

== WEP ==

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_Equivalent_Privacy WEP] is an encryption method for securing your wireless network. WEP is generally considered to be weak, you should use WPA instead if possible.

=== Using iwconfig manually ===

Note that for WEP our iwconfig requires a more specific format than generic iwconfig.

The canonical way of running iwconfig for WEP would be something like this:

# iwconfig eth0 key A4BEB3B8EC essid xyz

Two things are important here:

* the key must be in HEX. iwconfig will not do anything useful if the key is given as a string.   [http://www.powerdog.com/wepkey.cgi Here] is a handy ASCII string to HEX converter.

* the ESSID must follow the key.

If an incorrect key was set, please stop all activity on the interface for at least two minutes (i.e., killall udhcpc and ifconfig eth0 down), then issue the correct iwconfig command and retry.

=== Using WEP and /etc/network/interfaces ===
  iface eth0 inet dhcp
    wireless-key my_wep_key
    wireless-essid my_essid

 iface eth0 inet dhcp
    wpa-wep-key0 my_wep_key
    wpa-key-mgmt NONE
    wpa-ssid my_essid

Save your changes and run:
  # ifdown eth0 && ifup eth0
Idea : You can use [http://www.opkg.org/package_28.html ShortOm] to lauch this command on futur boot to activate wifi without having to use terminal

== Known Issues ==

=== GUI doesn't work in all cases ===

The GUI seems to have some issues that prevent it from working in all cases. 

If a Wi-Fi connection can not be made with the GUI, open a shell and use
[[Neo_FreeRunner_Wifi#Using_iwconfig_manually|iwconfig manually]].

=== iwconfig doesn't work in all cases ===

Note that for some reason our iwconfig requires a more constrained format than the generic iwconfig. See
[[Neo_FreeRunner_Wifi#Using_iwconfig_manually| using iwconfig manually]].

=== Anecdotal solutions ===

These solutions worked for some people:

==== Disable power management ====

Some APs apparently get upset by power managed devices, and the Freerunner enables power management of the wifi by default to preserve battery. One user's wrt54g certainly gets upset from time to time if he connect with the FreeRunner, sometimes refusing to talk to _anything_ over wifi afterwards until rebooted.

<pre>
iwconfig eth0 power off
</pre>

==== Modified script ====

"I changed the script a little:

 Exec=xterm -e "ifconfig eth0 down \
 iwconfig eth0 txpower off channel 0 \
 while killall wpa_supplicant; do echo 'Killing wpa_sup'; done \
 killall udhcpc \
 wpa_supplicant -i eth0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf -D wext -B \
 sleep 10; udhcpc"

Now it is working every time.
I am using 2008.latest (081004) and a linksys WAP54G accesspoint,

==== Use a different channel ====

"Could not get it to work properly on channel 11, so I set my accesspoint to channel 1."

==== Make your WIFI more reliable ====
After boot or before connecting do:
 wmiconfig -i eth0 --power maxperf
of course you need to find [[wmiconfig]] or to compile it

== Wake up from wireless (wow)==

Wi-Fi module constantly drain currents after module power up, for wi-fi SIP phone or some application need long standby time, will need wake up from wireless function for power saving. There is a sleep mode that Ar6k supported for wake up from wireless.

 http://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/src/target/AR6kSDK.build_sw.18/host/tools/wmiconfig

 export ATH_CROSS_COMPILE_TYPE=arm-angstrom-linux-gnueabi-
 make

Debian package:

 wget http://meshy.org/~ato/debian/pool/main/w/wmiconfig/wmiconfig_0.0.18-1_armel.deb
 dpkg -i wmiconfig_0.0.18-1_armel.deb

Basically, it's achieved via wmiconfig tool to issue IOCTL if we want
ar6k wifi module to generate interrupt to host controller. The procedure
to enable wakeup-on-wireless(wow) is listed here:

 1. wmiconfig --sethostmode asleep /* to tell ar6k what host's current is */
 2. wmiconfig --setwowmode enable /* enable wow function */
 3. wmiconfig --addwowpattern 0 1 33 01 ff /* add packet filter pattern, this is the ICMP filter pattern */
 4. apm -s
 5. ping IP_of_Neo
 6. The GPIO1 pin would be pulled up. The system would resume then.
 7. wmiconfig --sethostmode awake /* The firmware of ar6k will pull low the GPIO1 pin */

--addwowpattern <list-id> <pattern-size> <pattern-offset> <pattern> <pattern-mask>

Here are some addwowpattern commands:

Protocol type=IP=0800
Protocol type in IP header=ICMP=01

 - To filter for IP packets(offset 22)
 wmiconfig --addwowpattern 0 2 22 0800 ffff
 - To filter for ICMP packets (offset 33)
 wmiconfig --addwowpattern 0 1 33 01 ff

== A very ugly /etc/init.d/wlan startscript ==
 #!/bin/sh
 #
 # wlan	This shell script starts and stops wlan.
 #
 # processname: wlan
 
 # Source function library.
 #. /etc/rc.d/init.d/functions
 # "written" by HdR
 
 RETVAL=0
 prog="wlan"
 
 # test -f /etc/default/$prog && . /etc/default/$prog
 
 start() {
 	echo -n "Starting $prog: "
 	ifconfig eth0 up
 	wpa_supplicant -ieth0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf -B
 	sleep 10
 	udhcpc eth0
 	RETVAL=$?
 	return $RETVAL
 }
 
 stop() {
 	# Stop daemons.
 	echo -n "Shutting down $prog: "
         killall wpa_supplicant
 	ifconfig eth0 down
 #        killproc gpsd
 	RETVAL=$?
 	return $RETVAL
 }
 
 # See how we were called.
 case "$1" in
   start)
 	start
 	;;
   stop)
 	stop
 	;;
   restart|reload)
 	stop
 	start
 	RETVAL=$?
 	;;
   *)
 	echo "Usage: $0 {start|stop|restart}"
 	exit 1
 esac
 
 exit $RETVAL

Note: Don't forget to make this script executable with "chmod +x <filename>"

== Route internet connection through Wifi rather than USB ==

Wifi is faster than USB, so it is a good idea to tell the FreeRunner to connect through it. Put the following in /etc/network/interfaces under eth0:

up route del default gw 192.168.0.200

This will remove your computer as the default gateway and use the  wireless one when the interface is brought up. User nickd reports that sometimes it fails so he has had to put it in twice.

== ssh into FR over WiFi ==
dropbear, the ssh server, is configured to listen on the USB interface only. Wireless interfaces like wlan or bluetooth are disabled for security reasons (empty root password).

If you want to enable ssh over WiFi, change the /etc/default/dropbear from:

  DROPBEAR_PORT=`ip addr list usb0 | awk 'BEGIN { FS="[ /]+" } /inet / { print  $3 }'`:22

(which actually only prepends the usb0 ip address before the :22)

into:

  DROPBEAR_PORT=22

* Be careful with this config file since it can close the only door into your phone.

* Set a root password!
