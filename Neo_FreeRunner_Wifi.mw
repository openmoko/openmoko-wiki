To get wlan working with your NeoFreerunner, you can follow these steps:

1. create and edit a suitable /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf   (use your favourite search engine to get known the syntax)
2. execute `ifup eth0`
3. execute `wpa_supplicant -ieth0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf` (you can add a & for running in background)
4. get a IP via dhcp: `udhcpc eth0`

that's it, your wlan should work
