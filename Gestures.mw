Read more on how the project is going [http://www.borza.ro/index.php/category/accelerometer-based-gestures/ here]. I will release a video on YouTube that will demo the gesture recognition framework at the end of July. I'm currently working on continuous recognition. I've already done isolated recognition. Continuous recognition is almost like isolated recognition, only that I'm using a two-class gaussian classifier as the end-point detector.
