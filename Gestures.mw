=Alpha 2 Release (14 Aug 2008) for Neo FreeRunner=

==Video Demo==
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2S2rQUETwc Openmoko Neo FreeRunner does Accelerometer-based Gestures, and Screen Orientation]

''Remark: Please watch the video, so that you'd know what to expect out of the Alpha 2 Release.

==Sources==
In October 2008, the code moved from the  [http://code.google.com/p/accelges/source/browse/ Accelges Google Summer of Code] repository to a GIT server located at http://repo.accelsense.org.

==Alpha 2 Release: The Quick Way==
SSH Neo FreeRunner:
 wget http://accelges.googlecode.com/files/accelges_0.1.0-svnr204-r2_armv4t.ipk
 opkg install accelges_0.1.0-svnr204-r2_armv4t.ipk
On The Neo FreeRunner 
 /etc/init.d/gesl start
Over SSH you must use
 DISPLAY=:0 /etc/init.d/gesl start
(''otherwise screen orientation won't work''):

You're ready: make a gesture, make Neo change its screen orientation (''if you did watch the video, you'll know what to do'').

===Training: The Quick Way===
'''OPTIONAL''': Stop the gesture recognizer, and listener:
 /etc/init.d/gesd-neo2 stop
 /etc/init.d/gesl stop
Run
 Home > Gestures
Select a gesture, press Train, and follow instructions.

'''REQUIRED''': Start/restart the gesture recognizer, and listener:
 /etc/init.d/gesd-neo2 start (from SSH, or from Neo)
 /etc/init.d/gesl start ('''only from Neo''')

==Alpha 2 Release Details==

===Prerequisites===
* You can use any distribution you like; I would suggest using the [[Om 2008.8]] for now. You'll need these dependencies:
 dbus, dbus-glib, libxrandr, libnotify, notification-daemon, libcurl, and gtk+
* On the [[Om 2008.8]], you'll be missing:
libnotify, notification-daemon, libsexy2, libwnck-1-18, libstartup-notification-1-0, and libglade-2
 opkg install libnotify notification-daemon libsexy2 libwnck-1-18 libstartup-notification-1-0 libglade-2.0-0
''Remark: On the 2008.8, your missing dependencies will be downloaded automatically by the installer.''

===Preparing Om 2008.8 for Gestures===
* Turn off Suspend:
  Home > Settings > Suspend > off
* Make sure Neo has Web Access (use SSH):
 echo "nameserver xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx" > /etc/resolv.conf
* Install Terminal:
 Home > Installer > Development > openmoko-terminal2
* Create a shell script that will start the gesture listener daemon (use SSH):
 echo "exec /etc/init.d/gesl start" > /usr/bin/gesl-begin
 chmod +x /usr/bin/gesl-begin
* '''Restart Neo!'''

===Installing Gestures===
* Download the [http://accelges.googlecode.com/files/accelges_0.1.0-svnr204-r2_armv4t.ipk Alpha 2 Release Package], or (use SSH):
 echo "nameserver xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx" > /etc/resolv.conf
 wget http://accelges.googlecode.com/files/accelges_0.1.0-svnr204-r2_armv4t.ipk
* Install:
 opkg install accelges_0.1.0-svnr204-r2_armv4t.ipk

===Training Gestures===
* Launch the Gesture Manager:
 Home > Gestures
* Select a gesture and click the first icon on the toolbar; Follow the instructions. Do the same for all the gestures!
** Step 1: Launch Gesture Manager <br />[[Image:Accelges-Train-1.png|200px]]
** Step 2: This is the Gesture Manager <br />[[Image:Accelges-Train-2.png|200px]]
** Step 3: Select a gesture, and click Train (first icon from the toolbar) <br />[[Image:Accelges-Train-3.png|200px]]
** Step 4: Make the gesture (this step creates the gesture) <br />[[Image:Accelges-Train-4.png|200px]]
** Step 5: Make the gesture again (this step trains the gesture) <br />[[Image:Accelges-Train-5.png|200px]]
** Step 6: Select another gesture, and do the same <br />[[Image:Accelges-Train-6.png|200px]]

* Restart the Gesture Recognizer (use SSH):
 /etc/init.d/gesd-neo2 restart

''Remark: You have to restart the Gesture Recognizer, so that it will re-read the newly trained gestures. Every time you train one or more gestures, restart the recognizer!''

===Running Gestures===
* Use the script you have created before; '''be sure to run the script from the Neo, no SSH or VNC''':
 gesl-begin

* There are 12 gestures available (once, you make one, a notification will pop up):
{| border=1 |
| align="center"|Shake-shake gesture: <br />[[Image:Accelges-Recognize-1.png|100px]]
| align="center"|Forward-backward gesture: <br />[[Image:Accelges-Recognize-2.png|100px]]

''Remark: If you don't start the Gesture Listener from the Neo, screen orientation won't work''

===How To Improve Recognition Accuracy===
* Check to see which gesture gets recognized most often. Try training those gestures again.
* Determine which gestures don't get recognized at all. Try training those gestures again.

==Alpha 2 Development Details==
===DBUS===
Gesture Recognizer (gesd) sends signals on:
 org.openmoko.accelges
 /org/openmoko/accelges/Recognizer
 org.openmoko.accelges.Recognizer.Recognized

Try (on [[FSO]] distribution)
 mdbus -s -l
and make a gesture for more information on DBUS.

===Configuration Files===
The configuration file for Neo is:
 /etc/accelges/neo2/neo2.cfg
<pre>
# Paul-Valentin Borza <paul@borza.ro>

# gestures configuration file for Neo/Wii

# classes and probabilities for classifier
#    sclass\tFILE	static acceleration class
#    dclass\tFILE	dynamic acceleration class
#    sclassp\tVALUE	probability for static acceleration class
#    dclassp\tVALUE	probability for dynamic acceleration class
sclass	s.class
dclass	d.class
sclassp	0.4
dclassp	0.6

# classes for recognizer (add more than one)
#    class\tid\tFILE	static acceleration class
class	screen_zzp	screen_zzp.class
class	screen_zzn	screen_zzn.class
class	screen_zpz	screen_zpz.class
class	screen_znz	screen_znz.class
class	screen_pzz	screen_pzz.class
class	screen_nzz	screen_nzz.class
class	screen_npp	screen_npp.class
class	screen_nnp	screen_nnp.class
class	screen_pnp	screen_pnp.class
class	screen_ppp	screen_ppp.class

# models for recognizer (add more than one)
#    model\tid\tFILE	dynamic acceleration model
model	left	left.model
model	left, and return	left-and-right.model
model	right	right.model
model	right, and return	right-and-left.model
model	up	up.model
model	up, and return	up-and-down.model
model	down	down.model
model	down, and return	down-and-up.model
model	shake, shake	shake-shake.model
model	horizontal circle	horizontal-circle.model
model	forward, backward	forward-backward.model
model	z	z.model
</pre>

Again, if you modify the configuration file, you'll have to restart the gesture recognizer (gesd).

===Daemons===
Gesture Recognizer that uses the top accelerometer (/dev/input/event2):
 /etc/init.d/gesd-neo2 start|stop|restart
Gesture Listener that switches screen orientation, and notifies the user of recognized gestures on the screen:
 /etc/init.d/gesl start|stop|restart
''Remark: Start the recognizer first, and after that the listener (obvious, but important)''

=Components/Applications=
Try playing with:
 gesd (gesture recognizer)
 gesl (gesture listener)
 gesm (gesture manager)

=Known Issues=
* One, or both accelerometers might not work. Try:
 hexdump /dev/input/event2 (for top accelerometer)
 hexdump /dev/input/event3 (for bottom accelerometer)
''Remark: The Alpha 2 Release uses the TOP accelerometer''
* After a while, the accelerometers might stop working.
 Restart your Neo!
* After a while, the accelerometer send bogus values (values that are lower than what they should be). If this happens, the classifier won't be able to classify dynamic/static acceleration, and nothing will work - nor the gesture training, nor the gesture recognition.
 Restart your Neo!

=Use Cases=
* Mute audio or suspend when screen is facing down; - NO SUPPORT FOR MUTE/UNMUTE AUDIO IN NEO FOR NOW
* Go to main menu when shaken; - NO SUPPORT YET
* Volume up/down during call when tilting left/right (still unclear); - NO SUPPORT YET
* Turning the phone face to the user (not the same as taking it to the ear) to turn on the backlight - BACKLIGHT HAS A BUG, CAN'T BE USED YET
* Automatic portrait/landscape switching for the UI - <font color="#00FF00">Done</font>
* Turning the phone screen down to mute sound (and probably turn off the backlight) or hold call
* Swinging in an O-shape in the air to redial
* Moving the phone in a firm gesture from one ear to the other to switch between active and held calls
* Scrolling with firm tilts (suggested several times, should see if it's usable)
* Dropping (suggested several times, though it's unclear how to react to it)
* Shaking to get audio feedback (could e.g. imitate balls rolling inside to the number of unread messages, or liquid splashing to incdicate the battery level)
* Starting driving in a car (if that's detectable -- probably has other  patterns than walking etc) to switch to some “car mode”
* Stopping e.g. at a traffic light to choose a better time to notify about new messages than while driving
* Taking off in a plane (should be detectable, but hard to train) to shut down all RF systems
** This is a bad idea - you need to do that way before it lifts off the ground
* Similarly, landing to re-enable RF systems
** Similarly, you shouldn't turn them back on until way after the wheels touch the tarmac
* Vigorous shaking (side to side) while receiving a call could reject it.
* A sideways swing (90degres) out of the wrist could mean general Cancel/Esc/Back
* A long swing could close a app (more a arm swing than wrist. Same G-forces but longer time).
* These swing moves could be used on two axis and each in two axis for different usage.
* A firm wrist tilt backside down could mean global OK.
* Maybe some basic moves like these should have absolute global meaning. (like left, right, enter, esc)
* Mute phone my hitting it on something hard three times with one side.
* Face down lying still - lock screen
* Face up lying still - never lock screen
* holding the moko out & angling the front of it up repeatedly turns up volume
* angling front down repeatedly turns down volume
* a set of 5 or 10 standard, easily distinguishable gestures that the user can map to favorite programs
