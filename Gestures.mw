Read more on how the project is going [http://www.borza.ro/index.php/category/accelerometer-based-gestures/ here]. The gesture recognition library that is used on the Neo FreeRunner is the same one that is used in my [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX50lXuJ28Q video on YouTube] with the Nintendo Wii.

== Applications ==
* Mute audio or suspend when screen is facing down; (NO SUPPORT FOR MUTE/UNMUTE AUDIO IN NEO FOR NOW)
* Go to main menu when shaken; (NO SUPPORT YET)
* Volume up/down during call when tilting left/right (still unclear); (NO SUPPORT YET)
* Turning the phone face to the user (not the same as taking it to the ear) to turn on the backlight (BACKLIGHT HAS A BUG, CAN'T BE USED YET)
* Automatic portrait/landscape switching for the UI (DONE)
* Turning the phone screen down to mute sound (and probably turn off the backlight) or hold call
* Swinging in an O-shape in the air to redial
* Moving the phone in a firm gesture from one ear to the other to switch between active and held calls
* Scrolling with firm tilts (suggested several times, should see if it's usable)
* Dropping (suggested several times, though it's unclear how to react to it)
* Shaking to get audio feedback (could e.g. imitate balls rolling inside to the number of unread messages, or liquid splashing to incdicate the battery level)
* Starting driving in a car (if that's detectable -- probably has other  patterns than walking etc) to switch to some “car mode”
* Stopping e.g. at a traffic light to choose a better time to notify about new messages than while driving
* Taking off in a plane (should be detectable, but hard to train) to shut down all RF systems
* Similarly, landing to re-enable RF systems

Vigorous shaking (side to side) while receiving a call could reject it.

A sideways swing (90degres) out of the wrist could mean general 
Cancel/Esc/Back
A long swing could close a app (more a arm swing than wrist. Same 
G-forces but longer time).
These swing moves could be used on two axis and each in two axis for 
different usage.
A firm wrist tilt backside down could mean global OK.

Maybe some basic moves like thsese should have absolute global meaning.

(like left, right, enter, esc)

Mute phone my hitting it on something hard three times with one side.

Face down lying still - lock screen
Face up lying still - never lock screen

* holding the moko out & angling the front of it up repeatedly turns up volume
* angling front down repeatedly turns down volume
* a set of 5 or 10 standard, easily distinguishable gestures that the user can map to favorite programs
