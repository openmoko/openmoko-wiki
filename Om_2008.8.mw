=Introduction=
'''Om 2008.8''' is the successor to [[Om 2007.2]] and had '''ASU''' as a codename. It was [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-August/025619.html launched] on '''August 08, 2008'''. Om 2008.8 uses EFL for the launcher, custom UI applications and [[QtopiaOnX11|Qtopia on X11]] for telephony.  It is the first step from GTK+ on x11 to using multiple toolkits in combination. '''Om 2008.8''' now supports [http://www.enlightenment.org/ EFL], [http://trolltech.com/products/qtopia Qtopia] and [http://www.gtk.org GTK+] applications.

= Installing =

If you want install this software distribution to your device, you have to follow these steps:
* Download the recent image of Om2008.8 on the [[Downloads#Openmoko_2008.8_images_.28ASU.29|Downloads]] page
* [[Flashing the Neo FreeRunner|Flash]] to your Neo FreeRunner

= Known Issues =
'''GSM'''

* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1766 Cannot make calls or receive SMS messages]
* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1662 GSM not working properly after x hours]
* [https://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1765 No Pin-Dialog is showing up and so GSM is not usable at all]

'''WiFi'''
 
* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1625 WiFi can only connect once]

'''Audio quality'''

* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1721 QT-Dialer Sometimes can not hear anything durring connecting call]
* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1640 Improve overall audio]

'''System Software''' 

* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1736 Boot screen goes into sleep and never wake up if not touch during booting]
* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1597 After long suspend, kernel thread events]
* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1315 xglamo: performance decreases after a while]
* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1682 Neo turns off before reaching x]

'''Networking'''
* No Updates/Installation are possible or pings to domains because dns is not working. This problem occurs because the /etc/resolv.conf is empty by default.Add this line in /etc/network/interfaces:


 up echo nameserver 192.168.0.200 >/etc/resolv.conf
This is to be inserted below gateway address and above the bluetooth networking. After this rebooting is required. Then go to /etc/resolv.conf and fill it manually by just using the content of this file on your local machine, or DNS address.

This should solve most off your moko side networking issues. If you need any other help please refer to [[USB Networking]]

{{note| [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolvconf resolvconf] is installed so should probably be used }}

* Usb-networking will not work until rebooted after initial boot.

'''Usabillity''' 
* The Pin-Dialog by default just shows letters. You have to slide your finger up/down over the keyboard to make the numbers/uppercase/special characters appear.
* The installer app doesn't release administrative rights which results in not being able to use opkg. Sollution: run "killall packagekitd" (on the freerunner or when ssh'ed in).

== Updates ==

There should be some official updates for 2008.8 setup soon, but in the meantime, you'll have to wait.

{{note|There are *NO* updates available for 2008.8 anywhere on buildhost.openmoko.org - the daily-feeds directory is incompatible with 2008.8 and will corrupt your software configuration if you use it.}}

'''More details about the official updates being set-up here : http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-August/026515.html'''

In the meantime, you may try at your own risk [[Download#Unofficial_builds_by_zecke]].
