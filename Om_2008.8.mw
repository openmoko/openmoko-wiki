== Summary ==

'''Om 2008.8''' is the successor to [[Om 2007.2]] and had '''ASU''' as a codename. It was [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-August/025619.html released] on '''August 08, 2008''' (+ update "stable" releases starting from '''August 26, 2008'''). Om 2008.8 uses EFL for the launcher, custom UI applications and [[QtopiaOnX11|Qtopia on X11]] for telephony. The distribution  is the first step from GTK+ on x11 to using multiple toolkits in combination.

== What's New ? ==

Compared to 2007.2 that had a longer development history, Om 2008.8 was definitely a .0 major release. So think KDE 4.0 vs. 3.5, not Linux 2.6.23 vs. 2.6.22. There were daily updates, some good some bad. The official life of Om 2008.8 was terminated with the release of a minor update, [[Om 2008.9 Update]]. However, since the minor update introduced no new major changes, the following remains true for 2008.9 also.

The main user-visible changes compared to 2007.2 were:

* The user interface has been fully revised with a new window manager [[illume]]. It is visually much richer, and can be customized further by using your own [[Edje]] files.
* '''[[Om2008.8_Installer|A graphical installer]]''' allows to add easily new applications, [[Themes]] and functionality.
* A new [[Om2008.8_Locations|Locations]] application is provided, to save your favorite spots and share them with friends via sms.
* Power management has been improved: The Aux button now locks the screen, the Power button suspends and the red LED behind the Aux button lights up when charging.
* The [[Om2008.8_Keyboard| keyboard]] is now the Qtopia one (whether this is an improvement has been [[Keyboard_Debate|hotly debated]]).

For developers, the main changes are:
* Multiple toolkits: '''Om 2008.8''' supports [http://www.enlightenment.org/ EFL], [http://trolltech.com/products/qtopia Qtopia] and [http://www.gtk.org GTK+] applications.
* A [[Community Repository]] has been set up, it is integrated in the ([[Om2008.8_Installer|Installer]]).
* '''Source Codes''' are publicly available, allowing for customization all the way down to low level systems.

For more details, see the [[Om 2008.8 Guide]] and the [[Om 2008.8 Feature Plan]].

== Installation ==

To install the Om2008.8 stable distribution on the Neo FreeRunner, download the Root Filesystem and the Kernel image files from [[Download]] page and install according to [[Flashing the Neo FreeRunner]].

== Known Issues ==

This is only a subset, and some of the bits reported below may have been fixed by stable updates (see [http://onlinedev.blogspot.com/search/label/om2008.8%20review Alasal's test reports] as well as the "Updates" section below). See [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/search?q=2008.8 all tickets with 2008.8] in the bug tracker.

'''Suspend'''

Builds from the last days of August tend to suspend after 30s no matter what you set in settings. Switching the screensaver off with `xset s off' disables suspend completely.  Note that this command must be typed into the terminal application on the phone itself; if you try to run it from an ssh session it fails with the error `xset:  unable to open display ""'.  This is because ssh sessions change the display settings expecting you might want X11 forwarding.  In fact if you are using X11 forwarding with ssh -Y, the command won't fail over ssh, but it still won't do what you expect, as xset will assume you're talking about the forwarded X11 session, and thus doesn't affect the X11 session on the phone. Therefore if you use a ssh session you need to enter `xset -display :0 s off'.

Alex reportedly solved the problem going into Illume Settings, then Power, and setting to OFF the 2 parameters. He still gets the screensaver, but can reactivate easily just by touching.

If resume breaks audio (the ringing of the phone or for calling someone) a very probable reason is that the pulseaudio sound server is installed. This happens e.G. when openmoko-mediaplayer2 is installed. There seems to be [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/openmoko-kernel/2008-August/004877.html activity to fix this application] already, though.

'''GSM'''

* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1766 Cannot make calls or receive SMS messages]
* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1662 GSM not working properly after x hours]
* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1832 Cannot dial numbers starting with * or #]

'''WiFi'''

* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1929 WiFi can only connect once]

'''Audio quality'''

* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1640 Improve overall audio]

'''System Software'''

* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1736 Boot screen goes into sleep and never wake up if not touch during booting]
* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1597 After long suspend, kernel thread events]
* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1315 xglamo: performance decreases after a while]
* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1682 Neo turns off before reaching x]

'''QPE high cpu usage'''
* qpe does scan whole filesystem ( including SD card ) for documents , mp3 files , etc. If you don't want it you can edit <tt>/opt/Qtopia/etc/default/Trolltech/Storage.conf</tt> and disable Sd Card scanning ( overwrite 1 by 0 ), i.e. the section in the file should read like this after aplying the change to Om2008.9:
 <br><code>[MountPoint0]</code>
 <br><code>Name[] = SD Card</code>
 <br><code>Path=/dev/mmcblk0p1</code>
 <br><code>Removable = 1</code>
 <br><code>Applications = 0</code>
 <br><code>Documents = 0</code>
 <br><code>ContentDatabase = 0</code>


'''Networking'''
* No Updates/Installation are possible or pings to domains because DNS is not working. This problem occurs because the /etc/resolv.conf is empty by default.
Add these lines in /etc/network/interfaces:

up echo nameserver 208.67.222.222 > /etc/resolv.conf
up echo nameserver 208.67.220.220 >> /etc/resolv.conf
This is to be inserted below gateway address and above the bluetooth networking. After this it will be set on every reboot.

For resolving DNS without restarting, run the following commands:

echo nameserver 208.67.222.222 > /etc/resolv.conf
echo nameserver 208.67.220.220 >> /etc/resolv.conf
This should solve most of your moko side networking issues. If you need any other help please refer to [[USB Networking]]

{{note| [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolvconf resolvconf] is installed so should probably be used

'''Problem''': parts of resolvconf are missing:  without the scripts under /etc/network/if-{up,down}.d, and /etc/resolvconf/run/enable-updates and /lib/resolvconf/list-records it does nothing, and even then, /etc/resolvconf/run should probably be a symlink to /var/run, or /etc/resolv.conf needs to be pointed at /etc/resolvconf/run/resolv.conf -- once all that's done, it seems to work as long as you add something like this to /etc/network/interfaces at the end of the usb0 stanza:

dns-nameservers 192.168.0.200
dns-search example.com

and add <tt>usb*</tt> above <tt>eth*</tt> in <tt>/etc/resolvconf/interface-order</tt>

}}

{{Note| '''Solution:''' Steps to add missing resolvconf script: <br>
<code>touch /etc/resolvconf/run/enable-updates</code><br>
<code>cd /etc ; rm resolv.conf ; ln -s /etc/resolvconf/run/resolv.conf .</code><br>
<code>mkdir /lib/resolvconf/ ; cd /lib/resolvconf/</code><br>
<code>
<nowiki>wget http://87.227.108.179/list-records</nowiki> </code><br>
<code>chmod +x list-records</code><br>
Edit <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code> and remove the lines:<br>
<code>       network 192.168.0.0</code><br>
<code>       gateway 192.168.0.200</code><br>
If we need to use the usb network more then just locally from the computer in the other end of the USB-cable, login with ssh and add a default route like this:<br>
<code>route add default gateway 192.168.0.200</code>
}}

* Usb-networking will not work until rebooted after initial boot.

'''Usability'''

* The Pin-Dialog by default just shows letters. You have to slide your finger up/down over the keyboard to make the numbers/uppercase/special characters appear.
* The installer app doesn't release administrative rights which results in not being able to use opkg. Solution: run "killall packagekitd" (on the freerunner or when ssh'ed in).
* The installer app doesn't release administrative rights which results in not being able to use opkg. Alternate Solution: On the FreeRunner, use the drop-down menu to close all open applications.
* The keyboard may not be adapted for all uses. See [[Keyboard Debate]] for a full discussion and options.

== Updates for Om 2008.8 ==

Posterior to the Om2008.8 release made on 2008/08/08, development has been [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-August/026491.html split in two branches] aiming respectively at the next minor and major releases.

Support for 2008.8 occurs on the ''org.openmoko.asu.stable'' branch, with the short term goal to improve stability and useability, keeping the same features set. Changes to that branch are described in [http://git.openmoko.org/?p=openmoko.git;a=log;h=org.openmoko.asu.stable the Om 2008.8 stable changelog], and official updates  are available (as of 2008/08/26) in two forms (see [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-August/027997.html this message] for the announcement) :
* in the http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/Om2008.8/ opkg feeds. Since these are already configured  in 2008.8, using 'opkg update; opkg upgrade' is sufficient to get these.
* as flash-able images in http://downloads.openmoko.org/releases/Om2008.8-update/
On September 19th,  a point upgrade named [[Om 2008.9 Update]] was released.

The long-term development branch is named ''org.openmoko.dev''. This branch has refocused on the base system functionalities (applications will not be installed by default), and started by catching up with upstream. Critical bugfixes from that branch should percolate to the ''.asu.stable'' branch after an unspecified delay. Using binaries updates from that branch (or any other non-2008.8 repository) on a 2008.8 stable base is likely to send you in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell Dependency Hell], you have been warned.
