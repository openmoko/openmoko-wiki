= Summary =

'''Om 2008.8''' is the successor to [[Om 2007.2]] and had '''ASU''' as a codename. It was [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-August/025619.html released] on '''August 08, 2008'''. Om 2008.8 uses EFL for the launcher, custom UI applications and [[QtopiaOnX11|Qtopia on X11]] for telephony. The distribution  is the first step from GTK+ on x11 to using multiple toolkits in combination.

= What's New ? =

Compared to 2007.2 that has a longer development history, Om 2008.8 is definitely a .0 major release. So think KDE 4.0 vs. 3.5, not Linux 2.6.23 vs. 2.6.22. If you want the stability level required to use the Freerunner as your main phone, it is suggested for now to keep 2007.2 in the phone's flash memory and test 2008.8 on a removable SD card.

The main user-visible changes:

* The user interface has been fully revised with a new windows manager [[illume]]. It is visually much richer, and can be customized further by using your own [[Edje]] files.
* '''[[Om2008.8_Installer|A graphical installer]]''' allows to add easily new applications, themes and functionalities.
* A new [[Om2008.8_Locations|Locations]] application is provided, to save your favorite spots and share them with friends via sms.
* Power management has been improved: The Aux button now locks the screen, the Power button suspends and the red LED behind the Aux button lights up when charging.
* The [[Om2008.8_Keyboard| keyboard]] is now the Qtopia one (wether this is an improvement has been hotly debated).

For developers, the main changes are:
* Multiple toolkits: '''Om 2008.8''' supports [http://www.enlightenment.org/ EFL], [http://trolltech.com/products/qtopia Qtopia] and [http://www.gtk.org GTK+] applications.
* A [[CommunityRepository| Community Repository]] has been set up, it is integrated in the ([[Om2008.8_Installer|Installer]]).
* '''Source Codes''' are publicly available, allowing for customization all the way down to low level systems.

= Installation =

To install the Om2008.8 distribution on the Neo FreeRunner:
* As explained in the [[Downloads#Openmoko_2008.8_images_.28ASU.29|Downloads]] page, download the Root Filesystem ([http://downloads.openmoko.org/releases/Om2008.8/Om2008.8-gta02-20080808.rootfs.jffs2 Om2008.8-gta02-20080808.rootfs.jffs2], 68M) and the Kernel ([http://downloads.openmoko.org/releases/Om2008.8/Om2008.8-gta02-20080808.uImage.bin Om2008.8-gta02-20080808.uImage.bin], 1.8M) image files.
* Download and install the [[dfu-util]] software for your architecture.
* It's backup time !
* Using dfu-util, [[Flashing the Neo FreeRunner|flash]] the two images in the appropriate partitions of the Neo FreeRunner. Alternatively, you may test the distribution by installing it on the microSD card and [[Booting from SD | boot from microSD card]].
* Since you just wiped out /etc, /root  and /users, you may want to reconfigure a few things, like /etc/resolv.conf (see below). For security, you may want to set a root password, add a non-root user and transfer ~/.ssh/authorized_keys and so on.
* Reinstall your favorite applications.

= Known Issues =

This is only a subset. See [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/search?q=2008.8 all tickets with 2008.8] in the bug tracker.

'''GSM'''

* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1766 Cannot make calls or receive SMS messages]
* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1662 GSM not working properly after x hours]
* [https://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1765 No Pin-Dialog is showing up and so GSM is not usable at all]

'''WiFi'''
 
* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1625 WiFi can only connect once]
* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1734 WiFi shows up unknown] is caused by hald not running, which can be fixed by removing <tt>/etc/volatile.cache</tt> and rebooting

'''Audio quality'''

* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1721 QT-Dialer Sometimes can not hear anything durring connecting call]
* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1640 Improve overall audio]

'''System Software''' 

* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1736 Boot screen goes into sleep and never wake up if not touch during booting]
* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1597 After long suspend, kernel thread events]
* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1315 xglamo: performance decreases after a while]
* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1682 Neo turns off before reaching x]

'''Networking'''
* No Updates/Installation are possible or pings to domains because DNS is not working. This problem occurs because the /etc/resolv.conf is empty by default.
Add these lines in /etc/network/interfaces:

 up echo nameserver 208.67.222.222 > /etc/resolv.conf
 up echo nameserver 208.67.220.220 >> /etc/resolv.conf
This is to be inserted below gateway address and above the bluetooth networking. After this it will be set on every reboot.

For resolving DNS without restarting, run the following commands:

 echo nameserver 208.67.222.222 > /etc/resolv.conf
 echo nameserver 208.67.220.220 >> /etc/resolv.conf
This should solve most of your moko side networking issues. If you need any other help please refer to [[USB Networking]]

{{note| [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolvconf resolvconf] is installed so should probably be used 

'''Problem''': parts of resolvconf are missing:  without the scripts under /etc/network/if-{up,down}.d, and /etc/resolvconf/run/enable-updates and /lib/resolvconf/list-records it does nothing, and even then, /etc/resolvconf/run should probably be a symlink to /var/run, or /etc/resolv.conf needs to be pointed at /etc/resolvconf/run/resolv.conf -- once all that's done, it seems to work as long as you add somehting like this to /etc/network/interfaces at the end of the usb0 stanza:

    dns-nameservers 192.168.0.200
    dns-search example.com

and add <tt>usb*</tt> above <tt>eth*</tt> in <tt>/etc/resolvconf/interface-order</tt>

}}

* Usb-networking will not work until rebooted after initial boot.

'''Usability''' 
* The Pin-Dialog by default just shows letters. You have to slide your finger up/down over the keyboard to make the numbers/uppercase/special characters appear.
* The installer app doesn't release administrative rights which results in not being able to use opkg. Solution: run "killall packagekitd" (on the freerunner or when ssh'ed in).
* The installer app doesn't release administrative rights which results in not being able to use opkg. Alternate Solution: On the FreeRunner, use the drop-down menu to close all open applications.

= Future updates =

{{note|As of August 20th, there are *NO* updates available for 2008.8 anywhere on buildhost.openmoko.org - the daily-feeds directory is incompatible with 2008.8 and will corrupt your software configuration if you use it.}}

Posterior to the Om2008.8 release, in August 2008 development is switching to a Debian-like model with three branches: stable,  testing and unstable. To minimize chaos, breakage and confusion, official updates for 2008.8 will be made available only when the move is complete ([http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-August/026491.html see this message] for more details.)

In the meantime, you may try at your own risk [[Download#Unofficial_builds_by_zecke]] or [http://download.enlightenment.org/misc/ Raster's builds].
