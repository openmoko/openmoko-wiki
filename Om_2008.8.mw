'''Om 2008.8''' is the successor to [[Om 2007.2]] and had '''ASU''' as a codename. It was [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-August/025619.html released] on '''August 08, 2008'''. Om 2008.8 uses EFL for the launcher, custom UI applications and [[QtopiaOnX11|Qtopia on X11]] for telephony. The distribution  is the first step from GTK+ on x11 to using multiple toolkits in combination.  To see how it all got started go to [[Om2008.8 Feature Plan|Om 2008.8 Feature Plan]].

'''Om 2008.8''' was designed to be empty, for the very purpose of showcasing your ideas.

Think of our products as galleries. We're building the environment. Each one different from the next. You'll get all the free art supplies you could imagine because we want you to add your own meaning. You choose: consume, create, or both.

Either way you create your own meaning. It's about you.

* The keyboard is now the Qtopia one.

For developers, the main changes are:
* Multiple toolkits: '''Om 2008.8''' supports [http://www.enlightenment.org/ EFL], [http://trolltech.com/products/qtopia Qtopia] and [http://www.gtk.org GTK+] applications.
* A [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/CommunityRepository Community Repository] has been set up, it is integrated in the ([[Om2008.8_Installer|Installer]]).
* '''Source Codes''' are publicly available, allowing for customization all the way down to low level systems.

= Installing =

If you want install this software distribution to your device, you have to follow these steps:
* Download the recent image of Om2008.8 on the [[Downloads#Openmoko_2008.8_images_.28ASU.29|Downloads]] page. Images are only for the FreeRunner, not for the Neo1973.
* [[Flashing the Neo FreeRunner|Flash]] to your Neo FreeRunner

= Known Issues =
'''GSM'''

* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1766 Cannot make calls or receive SMS messages]
* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1662 GSM not working properly after x hours]
* [https://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1765 No Pin-Dialog is showing up and so GSM is not usable at all]

'''WiFi'''
 
* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1625 WiFi can only connect once]

'''Audio quality'''

* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1721 QT-Dialer Sometimes can not hear anything durring connecting call]
* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1640 Improve overall audio]

'''System Software''' 

* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1736 Boot screen goes into sleep and never wake up if not touch during booting]
* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1597 After long suspend, kernel thread events]
* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1315 xglamo: performance decreases after a while]
* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1682 Neo turns off before reaching x]

'''Networking'''
* No Updates/Installation are possible or pings to domains because dns is not working. This problem occurs because the /etc/resolv.conf is empty by default.Add this line in /etc/network/interfaces:


 up echo nameserver 192.168.0.200 >/etc/resolv.conf
This is to be inserted below gateway address and above the bluetooth networking. After this rebooting is required. Then go to /etc/resolv.conf and fill it manually by just using the content of this file on your local machine, or DNS address.

This should solve most off your moko side networking issues. If you need any other help please refer to [[USB Networking]]

{{note| [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolvconf resolvconf] is installed so should probably be used }}

* Usb-networking will not work until rebooted after initial boot.

'''Usabillity''' 
* The Pin-Dialog by default just shows letters. You have to slide your finger up/down over the keyboard to make the numbers/uppercase/special characters appear.
* The installer app doesn't release administrative rights which results in not being able to use opkg. Solution: run "killall packagekitd" (on the freerunner or when ssh'ed in).
* The installer app doesn't release administrative rights which results in not being able to use opkg. Alternate Solution: On the FreeRunner, use the drop-down menu to close all open applications.

= Future updates =

{{note|As of August 20th, there are *NO* updates available for 2008.8 anywhere on buildhost.openmoko.org - the daily-feeds directory is incompatible with 2008.8 and will corrupt your software configuration if you use it.}}

Posterior to the Om2008.8 release, in August 2008 development is switching to a Debian-like model with three branches: stable,  testing and unstable. To minimize chaos, breakage and confusion, official updates for 2008.8 will be made available only when the move is complete ([http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-August/026491.html see this message] for more details.)

In the meantime, you may try at your own risk [[Download#Unofficial_builds_by_zecke]] or Raster's builds.
