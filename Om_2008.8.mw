=Introduction=
'''Om 2008.8''' is the successor to [[Om 2007.2]] and had '''ASU''' as a codename. It was [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-August/025619.html launched] on '''August 08, 2008'''. Om 2008.8 uses EFL for the launcher, custom UI applications and [[QtopiaOnX11|Qtopia on X11]] for telephony.  It is the first step from GTK+ on x11 to using multiple toolkits in combination. '''Om 2008.8''' now supports [http://www.enlightenment.org/ EFL], [http://trolltech.com/products/qtopia Qtopia] and [http://www.gtk.org GTK+] applications.

== What's New ==
'''Om 2008.8''' was designed to be empty, for the very purpose of showcasing your ideas.

Think of our products as galleries. We're building the environment. Each one different from the next. You'll get all the free art supplies you could imagine because we want you to add your own meaning. You choose: consume, create, or both.

Either way you create your own meaning. It's about you.

'''Om 2008.8''' allows you to customize your Neo in many aspects.

*  '''Use the [[Om2008.8_Installer|Installer]]''' to find apps and modifications for your Neo.
*  '''Re-design themes''' by customizing your own [[Edje]] files.
*  '''Source Codes''' are publicly available, allowing for customization all the way down to low level sytems.

=== Share ===
* share your locations  ([[Om2008.8_Locations|Locations]])
:you can use '''Locations''' to save your favorite spots and even send it to friends via sms.  How cool is that?!
* share your applications ([[Om2008.8_Installer|Installer]])
:share your ideas with the world by adding packages to the [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/CommunityRepository Community Repository].  It is a great database for all things openmoko and can easily be accessed by any user through the [[Om2008.8 Installer|Installer]].

TBD

= Known Issues =
'''GSM'''

* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1662 GSM not working properly after x hours]
* [https://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1765 No Pin-Dialog is showing up and so GSM is not usable at all]

'''WiFi'''
 
* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1625 WiFi can only connect once]

'''Audio quality'''

* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1721 QT-Dialer Sometimes can not hear anything durring connecting call]
* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1640 Improve overall audio]

'''System Software''' 

* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1736 Boot screen goes into sleep and never wake up if not touch during booting]
* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1597 After long suspend, kernel thread events]
* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1315 xglamo: performance decreases after a while]
* [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1682 Neo turns off before reaching x]

'''Networking'''
* No Updates/Installation are possible or pings to domains because dns is not working. This problem occurs because the /etc/resolv.conf is empty by default. You have to fill it manually like just using the content of this file on your local machine. Be aware that /etc/resolv.conf is a symlink. You better remove with symlink and create a totally new file /etc/resolv.conf which you can now use.

{{note| [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolvconf resolvconf] is installed so should probably be used }}

* Usb-networking will not work until rebooted after initial boot.

'''Usabillity''' 
* The Pin-Dialog by default just shows letters. You have to move up/down on the screen with your fingers to make the numbers appear.
* The installer app doesn't release administrative rights which results in not being able to use opkg. Sollution: run "killall packagekitd" (on the freerunner or when ssh'ed in).
