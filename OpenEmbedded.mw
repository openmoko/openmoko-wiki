[[OpenMoko]], our distribution, is built using OpenEmbedded.  OpenEmbedded will:

* Generate (cross-compile) software packages for multiple embedded targets.
* Handle different hardware architectures, and support multiple releases across those architectures. 

For more information please see the [http://www.openembedded.org/ Open Embedded] website.

== Building the OpenMoko distribution with OpenEmbedded ==

=== OE upstream snapshot ===

We start from an OpenEmbedded snapshot from the official "upstream" aka "Vanilla" OpenEmbedded project. This snapshot contains the [[BitBake recipe]]s for thousands of packages

=== Upstream Source tarballs ===

When bitbake builds a particular OE package, it downloads the original source code of the upstream project (e.g. Linux kernel) and patches from the internet. After downloading sources, bitbake applies a series of patches to the tree. These patches have either been downloaded from the internet or are contained in the OpenEmbemdded metadata repository. The unpatched source tarballs are available from http://downloads.openmoko.org/sources/

=== Binary packages ===

If you don't want to build the whole distribution, you can download binary builds. Available are snapshot builds (tested) or autobuilds (untested).

Snapshots have received testing and are available at http://buildhost.openmoko.org/snapshots/

Automatic builds are untested and are available at 
* http://buildhost.openmoko.org/OM2007.2/tmp/deploy/ipk

=== Build directory ===

The content of the OpenMoko build server directory is available at
* http://buildhost.openmoko.org/OM2007.2/tmp/

It contains
* cache
** Internal caching data, not for human interpretation
* cross
** The cross-compilation toolchain used. You can download this and use it on your local machine.
* deploy
** deploy/images
*** The filesystem, kernel and bootloader images to be flashed into NAND
** deploy/ipk
*** the .ipk packages
* rootfs
** the extracted root filesystem. Please use the images from deploy/images instead
* staging
** no user servicable parts inside
* stamp
** internal state data
* work
** the actual build trees (including patches source code and binaries) of the individual packages
