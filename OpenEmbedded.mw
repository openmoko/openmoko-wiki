[[OpenMoko]], our distribution, is built using OpenEmbedded.  OpenEmbedded will:

* Generate (cross-compile) software packages for multiple embedded targets.
* Handle different hardware architectures, and support multiple releases across those architectures. 

For more information please see the [http://www.openembedded.org/ Open Embedded] website.

== Building the OpenMoko distribution with OpenEmbedded ==

=== OE upstream snapshot ===

We start from an OpenEmbedded snapshot from the official "upstream" aka "Vanilla" OpenEmbedded project. This snapshot contains the [[BitBake recipe]]s for thousands of packages

=== Upstream Source tarballs ===

When bitbake builds a particular OE package, it downloads the original source code of the upstream project (e.g. Linux kernel) and patches from the internet. After downloading sources, bitbake applies a series of patches to the tree. These patches have either been downloaded from the internet or are contained in the OpenEmbemdded metadata repository. The unpatched source tarballs are available from http://downloads.openmoko.org/sources/
