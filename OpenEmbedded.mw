Openmoko, our distribution, is built using OpenEmbedded.  OpenEmbedded will:

* Generate (cross-compile) software packages for multiple embedded targets.
* Handle different hardware architectures, and support multiple releases across those architectures. 

For more information please see the [http://www.openembedded.org/ Open Embedded] website.

== Building the Openmoko distribution with OpenEmbedded ==

Note that if you are an application developer, you probably don't want to build Openmoko with OpenEmbedded. In that case, you better use our prebuilt [[Toolchain]]. Building Openmoko is a time-, cpu- and diskspace-consuming process which should only be done if you are a system integrator and want to customize your Openmoko distribution.

The facility called [[MokoMakefile]] simplifies building OpenEmbedded, however it also shields you from a lot of knowledge. In case you are the aformentioned system integrator / distribution customizer, we strongly advise you to use BitBake and OpenEmbedded directly.

=== OpenEmbedded branch ===
The official Openmoko branch of the OpenEmbedded database used to be found at [http://git.openmoko.org Git.Openmoko.Org].
This branch is now '''CLOSED'''. Please commit fixes and updates upstream.

=== Upstream Source tarballs ===

When bitbake builds a particular OE package, it downloads the original source code of the upstream project (e.g. Linux kernel) and patches from the internet. After downloading sources, bitbake applies a series of patches to the tree. These patches have either been downloaded from the internet or are contained in the OpenEmbemdded metadata repository. The unpatched source tarballs are available from http://downloads.openmoko.org/sources/
