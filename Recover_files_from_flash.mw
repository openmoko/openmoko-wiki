This is what I did to access the file system on the flash memory after that my [[Neo FreeRunner]] did not boot anymore.
(Note that I'm using Qi and SHR-U on flash memory on jiffs).

= Make a bootable SD card =
Take an SD card of at least 1 GB from which all information may be deleted.
I installed Hackable:1 on the SD card by following these instructions:
http://www.hackable1.org/wiki/Installation

= Boot from your SD card =
Press and hold AUX button while pressing the power button.
Select the second option to boot from the SD card.

= Mount the file system that resides on your flash memory =
 mount -t jffs2 /dev/mtdblock6 /mnt/flash/

= Do your thing to make your phone booting again =
For example:
* Check the file system
* Do an opkg upgrade of a broken operating system
 chroot /mnt/flash opkg update
 chroot /mnt/flash opkg upgrade
* Backup some directories
 scp -r root@192.168.0.202:/mnt/flash/etc/freesmartphone/opim backupdir
