The PCF50606 is the Power Management Unit used in GTA01.  Apparently this unit is very popular in MP3 players, as the Rockbox project has talked a lot about writing a driver for it (but hasn't completed any, as far as we know).

Configuration of this PMU is done via an [[I2C]] bus from the [[S3C2410]].

* User Manual: [http://www.rockbox.org/twiki/pub/Main/DataSheets/pcf50606.pdf pcf50606.pdf]
* Driver Source: https://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/src/target/kernel/patches/gta01-pcf50606.patch

== Neo 1973 ==
{{main|Neo_1973_hardware}}
* Connected to: [[Samsung S3C2410]] via I2C, client address is 0x08.
* The PMU also connects to EINT16 and thus can issue interrupts to the main CPU.

This chip is only used in the Neo1973. The Neo FreeRunner uses [[NXP PCF50633]].

== Register dump after bootup ==

Since [[u-boot]] has built-in I2C support for the S3C2410, we can read out the register set of the PC50606 using a simple command:
