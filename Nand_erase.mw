To make a NAND erase, you need to connect to your device while in uboot using minicom or cu. The device will usually be called /dev/ttyACM0. You might need to 

 sudo chown uucp.uucp /dev/ttyACM0

to get the necessary right (even as root). Using cu, you can then access the Neo:

 cu -l /dev/ttyACM0

After connecting, you should get a prompt, where you can write:

 nand erase clean rootfs
 nand erase clean kernel

To exit cu you need to type:

 ~.
