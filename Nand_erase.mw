To make a NAND erase, you need to connect to your device while in uboot using minicom or cu. The device will usually be called /dev/ttyACM0. You might need to 

 sudo chown uucp.uucp /dev/ttyACM0

to get the necessary right (even as root). Using cu, you can then access the Neo:

 cu -l /dev/ttyACM0

After connecting, you should get a prompt where you can tell u-boot to clean certain parts of the NAND memory.

{{warning|Before you hit enter on one of the following commands, make sure that you are *not* issuing a plain "nand erase" command - always make sure you tell it which partition to erase. If you forget this you'll brick the Neo and you'll need a debug board to recover it.}}

 nand erase rootfs
 nand erase kernel

To exit cu you need to type:

 ~.
