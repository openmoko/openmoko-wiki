== Description ==

Dictator is a totalitarian recording and dictation application written in python-gtk turning the neo freerunnner into a secret service-weapon. ;-)
With it you can dictate your voice-notes via the handset-mic,
record the incoming gsm-sound while talking to someone or record the whole call including your voice. (You know you should inform the one you are talking to before record the call!!!)



== Download and Install ==

Get the package from opkg.org:
[http://www.opkg.org/packages/dictator_0.1_armv4t.ipk Download]




== Configuring ==

Use the config-file /etc/dictator.conf or create your own: ~/dictator.conf .

currently implemented options are:

folder - the Folder Dictator saves the recorded files to

soundcard - choose the soundcard you'd like to specify (like using arecord)

recordLimit - not implented yet

rate - Samplerate you'd like to record your sound with, standard is 8000 (Hz), should be enough!

sounddetection - not implemented yet - records only when it recognizes sound



== Recording ==

Recording GSM:
1. choose a record-mode (GSM-In or GSM & Mic)
2. dial
3. when call is established press record
4. stop if you like (most likely before ending the call)
5. file will show up at the playpage

Recording Mic:
1. just press record and speak into the mic (maybe you'd like to turn the screen 180Â° to have the real dictation-machine-feeling --> just feel free to configure /usr/bin/dictator.)



== Playing ==

Choose a file from the list and press Play.
You can play it with double speed by pressing Forward. (factor 1.5 makes better effects but unfortunately does not work.)
Or just delete a file if you don't like your voice. ;-)
