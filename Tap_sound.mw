Annoying isn't it?

To remove the tap sound, edit /etc/pulse/session and either remove the sample or switch to another one.

Tap sound on:

 load-sample touchscreen /usr/share/openmoko/sounds/touchscreen_click.wav

Tap sound off:

 #load-sample touchscreen /usr/share/openmoko/sounds/touchscreen_click.wav
