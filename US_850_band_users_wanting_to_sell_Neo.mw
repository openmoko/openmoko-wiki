If you live in the Western Hemisphere and can't use the Neo as it currently does not support the 850 band please put your name and down below so that potential buyers may contact you.





If you are interested in purchasing a second hand Neo put your name down here (if this gets good response I may move this to a separate page).

--[[User:Rakshat|Rakshat]] 04:40, 8 November 2007 (CET) I already have one GTA01 device. Would like another in black but as I am a student can't really afford  the $ 350 total it costs me to get it to India again. Can arrange for pick up in the US.
