=== The problem ===

The phase 1 [[Neo1973]] does not support support the 850 MHz GSM radio band. Since the 850 MHz band is popular in North America this may be a problem for North American users, as they will find poorer reception and more "black spots" on the Neo than on phones retailed locally especially in rural areas.

These countries also use 850 MHz:

Because the phase 1 Neo1973 was intended as a developer release a number of North American buyers may have received their Neos before this problem was fully appreciated.

=== Will a modification to my Neo 1973 (GTA01vb4) be possible? ===

As of Feb 08, it has been confirmed by OpenMoko[http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.handhelds.openmoko.community/9196] that this is not possible, presumably due to the difficulties in getting FCC approval for a (relatively) small number of phones for a model which is no longer in production.

The best option for those with GTAO1 phones in areas where they need 850MHz is therefore to get a Neo FreeRunner instead which everyone presumes will have an 850MHz option
