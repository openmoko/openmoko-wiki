Neither the [[Neo1973|phase 1 nor the phase 2 versions of the Neo]] support the 850 MHz band. Since the 850 MHz band is popular in North America this may be a problem for North American users, as they will find poorer reception and more "black spots" on the Neo than on phones retailed locally.

These countries also use 850 MHz:

Because the phase 1 Neo was intended as a developer release a number of North American buyers may have received their Neos before this problem was fully appreciated.
