=== The problem ===

The phase 1 [[Neo1973]] does not support support the 850 MHz GSM radio band. Since the 850 MHz band is popular in North America this may be a problem for North American users, as they will find poorer reception and more "black spots" on the Neo than on phones retailed locally especially in rural areas.

These countries also use 850 MHz:

Because the phase 1 Neo1973 was intended as a developer release a number of North American buyers may have received their Neos before this problem was fully appreciated.

=== The possible solution ===
As of Feb 08, there is currently a GSM test of a reworked Neo1973 which supports the 850MHz band which is being mailed around the USA to check actual performance.   See [[GSM 850 test]] for more details.
