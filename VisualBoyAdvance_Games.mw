all Gameboy/Gameboy Color games are working (theoretically)

Problem is input. On Freerunner is only usable input touchscreen, which is unfortunately single-touch. 

What we need is make a list of games playable with just one button pressed at the time.

== Playable games ==
turn-based strategies/RPG, adventures, platform games
* Battletoads
* Bust-a-Move 2 - ala frozen bubble
* Buster Brothers 
* Croc 
* Croc 2
* Flintstones, The 
* Gameboy Gallery 
* Kung-Fu Master
* Lock 'N Chase
* Looney Tunes
* Mortal Kombat
* Pac-Man & Pac-Attack SCE 
* Pac-Man
* Pokemon Red/Blue/Green/Yellow
* Pokemon Gold/Silver
* Yoshi (U)
* Brick Breaker DX (PD) [C]

== Not playable games ==
Action, FPS, Arcade
* Lemmings
* Supermario
* Rayman
== Don't work ==
* Invasion DX (Bung) (PD) [C]
