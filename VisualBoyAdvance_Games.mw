all Gameboy/Gameboy Color games are working (theoretically)

Problem is input. On Freerunner is only usable input touchscreen, which is unfortunately single-touch. 

What we need is make a list of games playable with just one button pressed at the time.

== Playable games ==
* Pokemon Red/Blue/Green/Yellow
* Pokemon Gold/Silver

== Not playable games ==
* Lemmings
* Supermario
