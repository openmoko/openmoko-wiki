The current applications list has the Reader as a Stylus based app.  Personally I feel that a "simple" finger app would be more useable for reading ebooks, with a seperate stylus app with text input for editing/annotating/re-formatting ebooks/documents.

I think the Reader could use the standard finger app template using the AUX button to page down through the document, and the scroll wheel to page up and down (tap arrows) and scroll through the document (press and drag).

Pressing the black centre of the scroll wheel could pop-out the menu buttons with 6 buttons.

The buttons would:
1. Change font size (press button, use scroll wheel, press button to return)
2. Change line spacing (as above)
3. Start/stop the text scrolling up the screen, scroll speed could be changed using the wheel (scrolling also stopped by AUX)
4. Open standard file browser to find another document
5. Open a menu screen with further options
6. Exit the app

A progress bar would also be good, either across the bottom or curved around the scroll wheel.

I'd love to help with the development of this app but I'm afraid I'm a complete novice.  If anybody else wants to take it on I'll help in any way I can.
