The current applications list has the Reader as a Stylus based app.  Personally I feel that a finger app would be more useable for reading ebooks, with a seperate stylus app for editing/annotating/re-formatting ebooks/documents.

I've put together a couple of images to show what I have in mind.  They were just thrown together so please don't judge the idea on the quality of my GIMPing.

I'd love to help with the development of this app but I'm afraid I'm a complete novice.  If anybody else wants to take it on I'll help in any way I can.
