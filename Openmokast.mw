== Openmokast features ==

Openmokast can use a USB DAB/DMB receiver to receive and decode multimedia services. Currently the available services are:
* DAB audio (Musicam)
* DAB+ audio (AAC+ v2)
* MOT Slideshow
* Journaline

No compatible receiver is currently publicly available on the market but some manufacturer have been contacted in order to find one with which we can release the driver needed to control the hardware.

Currently the software can be used with a special file format that simulates a broadcast reception. Those files can be build using the online services available from http://mmbtools.crc.ca/.
