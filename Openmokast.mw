Openmokast is a digital broadcasting application that can use a USB DAB/DMB device to receive mobile multimedia services.

Website: http://openmokast.org/

== Openmokast features ==

Openmokast can use a USB DAB/DMB receiver to receive and decode multimedia services. Currently the available services are:
* DAB audio (Musicam)
* DAB+ audio (AAC+ v2)
* MOT Slideshow
* Journaline

No compatible receiver is currently publicly available but some chip set manufacturers were contacted to provide the required drivers and APIs which are needed to control the hardware.

Currently the software can be used with a special file format that simulates a broadcast reception. Those files can be built using the online services available from http://mmbtools.crc.ca/.
