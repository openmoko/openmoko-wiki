== Why SHR exists ==
The [[Stable Hybrid Release]] (SHR) is intended to be a community driven distribution composed of the [[OpenmokoFramework|FSO]] and some basic applications, that can be configured to use several different graphical toolkits, for example GTK or EFL. SHR is based on the FSO build. At first, SHR was introduced in order to use the [[Openmoko2007.2]] GTK software in combination with the new [[OpenmokoFramework|FSO]], but things have changed.

====Why not just use plain FSO?====
[[FSO]] is the initiative by Mickey Lauer and crew to create a good [[D-Bus]] infrastructure which runs on the neos, among other devices.

FSO is by far the most stable & usable release, if all you want is a phone.  (I mean *all*. It just has a dialer, which is a demo application.)

FSO is never intended on its own to be a full image, it's just the infrastructure and a demo app.

Other people are supposed to put a front end on FSO. So that's what we're doing.

== Install ==

Installing SHR is very easy. I will explain how to install the testing version of SHR. It is stable enaough for a daily use. Stable version will be available soon ([http://blog.shr-project.org/ Stable announcement], unstable (for the adventurous testers) is also available.
 I suppose that you know how to use [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/NeoTool NeoTool]
You need to download two files from [http://build.shr-project.org/shr-testing/images/om-gta02/ here]
- the kernel (uImage-om-gta02-latest.bin)
- the system (modules file)

You can view the sources http://git.shr-project.org/git/ here].
