''This page is a placeholder to get us organized until we can get a build started.''

== Overview ==
The [[Stable Hybrid Release]] (SHR) is intended to be a combination of the [[OpenmokoFramework|FSO]], some of the 2007.2 GTK software, and the [[ASU_Feature_Plan|ASU]] that provides all of the functionality of the 2007.2 software, but with the stability of the FSO and the new GUI toolkits provided by the ASU.  It will probably be based on an ASU build, with the FSO software and GTK end-user apps added.

(We're not married to the idea of using the GTK apps, but they already exist and are more-or-less debugged at least on the UI side.  If someone knows of a more stable and/or usable app that's appropriate for the OM, let us know by dropping a comment on the Talk tab of this page.)

== First steps ==
The first pass at making the GTK software use the FSO will involve just creating a gsmd workalike that sends commands to the ophoned dbus api from FSO.  mickeyterm is an example of another program that lets you send GSM commands through ophoned.

We want to have a build that is stable, so we'll need some standard way of identifying the latest stable pieces of all the different software in the SHR, as well as a way to identify previous released versions of the SHR.

== Interest ==
Here's a list of people who've expressed an interest in working on the SHR.  Please add your name (with a link to your user page) if you'd like to help.  Also, please put a way to contact you on your user page.

<pre>
12:36 < wurp2> Everything *new* goes on OM projects site
12:36 < Ainulindale> I totally agree
12:36 < wurp2> Updates to 2007.2 apps go back into the home svn
12:36 < Ainulindale> paulproteus: no, you're an external cabal all by yourself
                     :-)
12:36 < cb22> anyone planning on drawing up a roadmap?
12:36 < paulproteus> cb22, We can do that in Trac in fact.
12:36 < wurp2> And changes to the underlying release go as patches into our OE
               branch, yes?
12:36 < paulproteus> (or on the wiki page)
12:36 < paulproteus> wurp2, Right
12:36 < paulproteus> mwester, Sanity-check my terminology where I mess things
                     up!
12:37 < Ainulindale> hmmm fuzzy for me but what should go in OM and what should
                     go in OE ?
12:37 <@mwester> Sure
12:37 <@mwester> What do you mean by OM?
12:37 < paulproteus> Ainulindale, New software we write goes in the
                     projects.openmoko.org.
12:37 <@mwester> right.
12:37 < Ainulindale> Ok so the wrapper for example
12:37 < wurp2> Anything stand-alone goes in OM (projects.openmoko.org)
12:37 < wurp2> yeah
12:37 <@mwester> So we will use projects.openmoko.org for as much as we can,
                 and OE to build the distro.
12:37 < Ainulindale> Sounds right to me
12:37 < wurp2> Great!
12:38 <@mwester> We *will not* use the OM git repo, as that is owned and
                 controlled by Openmoko the company...
