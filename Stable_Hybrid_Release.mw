''This page is a placeholder to get us organized until we can get a build started.''

== Overview ==
The [[Stable Hybrid Release]] (SHR) is intended to be a combination of the [[OpenmokoFramework|FSO]], some of the 2007.2 GTK software, and the [[ASU_Feature_Plan|ASU]] that provides all of the functionality of the 2007.2 software, but with the stability of the FSO and the new GUI toolkits provided by the ASU.  It will probably be based on an ASU build, with the FSO software and GTK end-user apps added.

(We're not married to the idea of using the GTK apps, but they already exist and are more-or-less debugged at least on the UI side.  If someone knows of a more stable and/or usable app that's appropriate for the OM, let us know by dropping a comment on the Talk tab of this page.)

== First steps ==
The first pass at making the GTK software use the FSO will involve just creating a gsmd workalike that sends commands to the ophoned dbus api from FSO.  mickeyterm is an example of another program that lets you send GSM commands through ophoned.

We want to have a build that is stable, so we'll need some standard way of identifying the latest stable pieces of all the different software in the SHR, as well as a way to identify previous released versions of the SHR.
