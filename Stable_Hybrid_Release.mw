== Why SHR exists ==
The [[Stable Hybrid Release]] (SHR) is intended to be a community driven distribution composed of the [[OpenmokoFramework|FSO]] and some basic applications, that can be configured to use several different graphical toolkits, for example GTK or EFL. SHR is based on the FSO build. At first, SHR was introduced in order to use the [[Openmoko2007.2]] GTK software in combination with the new [[OpenmokoFramework|FSO]], but things have changed.

====Why not FSO?====
FSO is the initiative by Mickey Lauer and crew to create a good [[D-Bus]] infrastructure which runs on the neos, among other devices.

FSO is by far the most stable & usable release, if all you want is a phone.  (I mean *all*. It just has a dialer, which is a demo application.)

FSO is never intended on its own to be a full image, it's just the infrastructure and a demo app.

Other people are supposed to put a front end on FSO. So that's what we're doing.

=== Getting the source code ===

We're currently hosted by [[User:Ainulindale|Ainulindale]] on svn://daria.forty-two.fr/shr . In order to contribute, you have to ask Ainulindale to get your public key on the server.

There is no need to download the code independently as it is automatically obtained when setting the development environment described in [[SHR Development]].

=== [[libframeworkd-glib]] ===

In order to be able to use in an easy way frameworkd, without bothering about dbus calls (which could be difficult for new developers), we built a library allowing everyone to use the functions of frameworkd as if it were simple C functions. We're using asynchronous callbacks for dbus. libfraemworkd-glib is heavily used by SHR applications and now hosted on http://git.freesmartphone.org/?p=libframeworkd-glib.git;a=summary.

=== Architecture ===
SHR uses FSO to interface to the hardware, so see the FSO architecture documentation, too. For how the openmoko*3 applications that SHR forked off 2007.2 access FSO, see http://www.calaquendi.org/om/lf.png.
