== Overview ==
The [[Stable Hybrid Release]] (SHR) is intended to be a combination of the [[OpenmokoFramework|FSO]], some of the [[Openmoko2007.2]] GTK software, and the [[ASU_Feature_Plan|ASU]] that provides all of the functionality of the 2007.2 software, but with the stability of the FSO and the new GUI toolkits provided by the ASU.  It will probably be based on an ASU build, with the FSO software and GTK end-user apps added.

Follow the project here: [http://projects.openmoko.org/projects/shr SHR Project Homepage]

== Why SHR exists ==
At first, SHR was introduced in order to use the [[Openmoko2007.2]] GTK software with the new [[OpenmokoFramework|FSO]].
Things have changed.


=== Why not FSO? ===
FSO is the initiative by Mickey Lauer and crew to create a good [[D-Bus]] infrastructure which runs on the neos, among other devices.

FSO is by far the most stable & usable release, if all you want is a phone.  (I mean *all*.  It just has a dialer right now, not even call history.)

FSO is never intended on its own to be a full image, it's just the infrastructure and a demo app.

Other people are supposed to put a front end on FSO.  So that's what we're doing.

=== Why SHR? ===
So SHR is FSO, with us doing the necessary work to get some basic applications runing on a stable platform.


== Interest ==
See the Developer Info on the upper right side of the [http://projects.openmoko.org/projects/shr SHR project page].

== How to join ==
* Hang out in ''#openmoko-cdevel'' on ''irc.freenode.net'' between 5pm and 11pm GMT to chat with the people developing SHR.  (Primarily MarcOChapeau, Ainulindale and quickdev.)
* Send a request to join on the [http://projects.openmoko.org/projects/shr SHR project] on the OM projects page.
* Join [http://lists.projects.openmoko.org/mailman/listinfo/shr-devel shr-devel@lists.projects.openmoko.org] and send an introductory email. The introductory email can just be a couple of lines if you like.  It should include what part would you want to work on, and any special knowledge you have that would relate to the project, e.g. if you are an OE guru or linux kernel geek, matchbox-window manager guru, etc.
* See [[SHR Development]] to find out how to set up your development environment to work on existing SHR packages.

== Tasks & status ==

The list of tasks is available at the [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/milestone/SHR SHR Milestone] page. Some information is missing this is why the table below is still valid.

Statuses:
* '''Needs owner!''' - someone needs to take responsibility for this task
* Not started - someone has taken responsibility, but hasn't done anything yet...
* Started - someone has started work, but there is nothing usable yet
* Alpha - it might work, maybe
* Beta - it probably works most of the time
* Maintained - a stable release is out there, working on oddball bugs & new features
* Done - a stable release is out there, no activity on this task now

== Technical Help ==

=== Getting the source code ===

We're currently hosted by [[User:Ainulindale|Ainulindale]] on svn://daria.forty-two.fr/shr . In order to contribute, you have to ask Ainulindale to get your public key on the server.

There is no need to download the code independently as it is automatically obtained when setting the development environment described in [[SHR Development]].

=== Build logic ===

Current applications (openmoko-dialer3 and openmoko-panel-gsm) use frameworkd.
So in order to be able to build and test these applications, you have to build frameworkd and gsm0710muxd.

=== [[libframeworkd-glib]] ===

In order to be able to use in an easy way frameworkd, without bothering about dbus calls (which could be difficult for new developers), we built a library allowing everyone to use the functions of frameworkd as if it were simple C functions. We're using asynchronous callbacks for dbus.

=== Architecture ===
SHR uses FSO to interface to the hardware, so see the FSO architecture documentation, too. For how the openmoko*3 applications that SHR forked off 2007.2 access FSO, see http://www.calaquendi.org/om/lf.png.

== List of packages included ==

From FSO:
* ophoned
* preferencesd
* pimd
* odeviced
* lots more...

Additionally:
* openmoko-dialer3


== IRC conversation about how we're using revision control ==

''This is deprecated, for now we use shr-devel as our only repository.  This will change after the first SHR release.''<br/>

<pre>
12:36 < wurp2> Everything *new* goes on OM projects site
12:36 < Ainulindale> I totally agree
12:36 < wurp2> Updates to 2007.2 apps go back into the home svn
12:36 < Ainulindale> paulproteus: no, you're an external cabal all by yourself
                     :-)
12:36 < cb22> anyone planning on drawing up a roadmap?
12:36 < paulproteus> cb22, We can do that in Trac in fact.
12:36 < wurp2> And changes to the underlying release go as patches into our OE
               branch, yes?
12:36 < paulproteus> (or on the wiki page)
12:36 < paulproteus> wurp2, Right
12:36 < paulproteus> mwester, Sanity-check my terminology where I mess things
                     up!
12:37 < Ainulindale> hmmm fuzzy for me but what should go in OM and what should
                     go in OE ?
12:37 <@mwester> Sure
12:37 <@mwester> What do you mean by OM?
12:37 < paulproteus> Ainulindale, New software we write goes in the
                     projects.openmoko.org.
12:37 <@mwester> right.
12:37 < Ainulindale> Ok so the wrapper for example
12:37 < wurp2> Anything stand-alone goes in OM (projects.openmoko.org)
12:37 < wurp2> yeah
12:37 <@mwester> So we will use projects.openmoko.org for as much as we can,
                 and OE to build the distro.
12:37 < Ainulindale> Sounds right to me
12:37 < wurp2> Great!
12:38 <@mwester> We *will not* use the OM git repo, as that is owned and
                 controlled by Openmoko the company...
