== Overview ==
The [[Stable Hybrid Release]] (SHR) is intended to be a community driven distribution composed of the [[OpenmokoFramework|FSO]] and some basic applications, that can be configured to use several diffrent graphical toolkits, for example GTK or EFL. SHR is based on the FSO build.

== Why SHR exists ==
At first, SHR was introduced in order to use the [[Openmoko2007.2]] GTK software in combination with the new [[OpenmokoFramework|FSO]].
Things have changed. SHR is now mainly a community driven distribution, that contains some basic applications which make use of the [[OpenmokoFramework|FSO]].

'''Why not FSO?'''
FSO is the initiative by Mickey Lauer and crew to create a good [[D-Bus]] infrastructure which runs on the neos, among other devices.

FSO is by far the most stable & usable release, if all you want is a phone.  (I mean *all*. It just has a dialer, which is a demo application, right now.)

FSO is never intended on its own to be a full image, it's just the infrastructure and a demo app.

Other people are supposed to put a front end on FSO. So that's what we're doing.

== Interest ==
See the Developer Info on the upper right side of the [http://projects.openmoko.org/projects/shr SHR project page].

== How to join ==
* Hang out in ''#openmoko-cdevel'' on ''irc.freenode.net'' between 5pm and 11pm GMT to chat with the people developing SHR.  (Primarily MarcOChapeau, Ainulindale and quickdev.)
* Send a request to join on the [http://projects.openmoko.org/projects/shr SHR project] on the OM projects page.
* Join [http://lists.projects.openmoko.org/mailman/listinfo/shr-devel shr-devel@lists.projects.openmoko.org] and send an introductory email. The introductory email can just be a couple of lines if you like.  It should include what part would you want to work on, and any special knowledge you have that would relate to the project, e.g. if you are an OE guru or linux kernel geek, matchbox-window manager guru, etc.
* See [[SHR Development]] to find out how to set up your development environment to work on existing SHR packages.

== Tasks & status ==

The list of tasks is available at the [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/milestone/SHR SHR Milestone] page. Some information is missing this is why the table below is still valid.

== Technical Help ==

=== Getting the source code ===

We're currently hosted by [[User:Ainulindale|Ainulindale]] on svn://daria.forty-two.fr/shr . In order to contribute, you have to ask Ainulindale to get your public key on the server.

There is no need to download the code independently as it is automatically obtained when setting the development environment described in [[SHR Development]].

=== Build logic ===

Current applications (openmoko-dialer3 and openmoko-panel-gsm) use frameworkd.
So in order to be able to build and test these applications, you have to build frameworkd and gsm0710muxd.

=== [[libframeworkd-glib]] ===

In order to be able to use in an easy way frameworkd, without bothering about dbus calls (which could be difficult for new developers), we built a library allowing everyone to use the functions of frameworkd as if it were simple C functions. We're using asynchronous callbacks for dbus. libfraemworkd-glib is heavily used by SHR applications and now hosted on http://git.freesmartphone.org/?p=libframeworkd-glib.git;a=summary.

=== Architecture ===
SHR uses FSO to interface to the hardware, so see the FSO architecture documentation, too. For how the openmoko*3 applications that SHR forked off 2007.2 access FSO, see http://www.calaquendi.org/om/lf.png.

== List of packages included ==

From FSO:
* frameworkd

Additionally:
* libframeworkd-glib (C bindings for frameworkd dbus interface)
* ophonekitd (daemon that handles frameworkd events, for example showing the UI on an incoming call)
* openmoko-dialer3

== Reference Material ==
* [http://www.pokylinux.org/doc/poky-handbook.html How to build a linux distribution using bitbake, etc]
* [http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-python/doc/tutorial.html Using DBus in python]
