''ompower'' is a suspend handling daemon talking dbus installed by default since [[Om 2008.8]]. It is responsible for triggering or aborting suspension of your phone. Applications send dbus messages which are evaluated by ompower. This may be used, for example, to abort suspending the phone while doing GPS tracking.

== How does it work? ==
If an application wants to tell the phone that it should not suspend, it should send a dbus message. This message could be send by dbus API. In case of a shell script, sending dbus messages could be achieved by the command ''dbus-send'':
 dbus-send --system --dest=org.openmoko.Power / org.openmoko.Power.Core.RequestResourceState? \
 string:cpu string:my-system-name string:on

If the application then is in a state it could be suspendet, it should send:
 dbus-send --system --dest=org.openmoko.Power / org.openmoko.Power.Core.RemoveRequestedResourceState? \
 string:cpu string:my-system-name 

"my-system-name" is an identifier telling dbus the requesting source. In case of tangogps, this could be "application-tangogps".

''ompower'' will not trigger suspend (via calling ''apm -s'') until all requests for resources are removed.
