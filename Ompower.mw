''ompower'' is a suspend handling daemon talking dbus installed by default since [[Om 2008.8]]. It is responsible for triggering or aborting suspension of your phone. Applications send dbus messages which are evaluated by ompower. This may be used, for example, to abort suspending the phone while doing GPS tracking.

== How does it work? ==
''ompower'' manages suspension, but does not enforce it. It does this by a request mechanism. Applications may request either suspension or power-on.
As long as requests for "power on" are active, the phone will not suspend. If no such requests are active (all "power-on" requests are removed or no requests have been made so far) ''ompower'' will suspend the phone (via calling ''apm -s''), if "power-off" requests are active. The "power-off" requests are usually issued by some application such as [[Illume]]. If neither "power-on" and "power-off" requests are in ''ompower''s queue, nothing will happen.

=== Avoid suspension ===
If an application wants to tell the phone that it should not suspend, it should send a dbus message. This message could be send by dbus API. In case of a shell script, sending dbus messages could be achieved by the command ''dbus-send'':
 dbus-send --system --dest=org.openmoko.Power / org.openmoko.Power.Core.RequestResourceState? \
 string:cpu string:my-system-name string:on

If the application then is in a state it could be suspendet, it should send:
 dbus-send --system --dest=org.openmoko.Power / org.openmoko.Power.Core.RemoveRequestedResourceState? \
 string:cpu string:my-system-name 

"my-system-name" is an identifier telling dbus the requesting source. In case of tangogps, this could be "application-tangogps".

=== Requesting suspension ===
The daemon is also able to request a suspend by explicitely requesting a "power off":
 dbus-send --system --dest=org.openmoko.Power / org.openmoko.Power.Core.RequestResourceState? \
 string:cpu string:my-system-name string:off
