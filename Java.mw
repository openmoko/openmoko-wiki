There are two main types of Java platforms that can be made available on OpenMoko devices such as the Neo1973.
* Java Standard Edition (JSE)
* Java Micro Edition (JME/J2ME)

== Java Standard Edition ==

This is the incarnation of the desktop version of Sun's Java platform. The majority of its codebase was recently opensourced under the GPL+exception license; the closed bits are quickly being replaced by unencumbered alternatives.

When people talk of Java applications, they're usually referring to software targetted to this platform.

== Java Micro Edition ==

This is the 'lite' edition of the Java platform. Modular and optimised for embedded devices, this platform provides a much more restricted set of language and library features.

When talking about games, and mobile phone games in general, people are normally referring to this platform.
