A new battery type has appeared:
*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_iron_phosphate_battery

Advantages:
*1000+ (dis)charge deep-cycles.
*Low self-discharge; 5% / month at 25 deg. celcius
*Very electrically robust
*Very mechanically robust - can literally be nailed without explosion danger.
*-30...60 deg. celcius operating
*a123systems ANR26650M1 3.3V 2.3Ah can be charged in 15 minutes.
*a123systems ANR26650M1 3.3V 2.3Ah cells are laserwelded instead of crimping, which lower water losses and therefore extends celllife.

**Quote: "...The M1 cells behave differently from other Lithium technologies. The specified end of charge voltage is 3.6 volts rather than 4.2 volts....The M1 cell, on the other hand, accepts very little additional energy above 3.6V....So how do the M1 cells compare? Tests so far show that over the course of a couple of weeks, the loss of capacity is close to zero. That's a good thing!..."

==Traditional (Li-ion (polymer)) lithium-accumulator only handles 300-500 (dis)charge deep-cycles==

How to prolong lithium-based batteries:
http://www.batteryuniversity.com/parttwo-34.htm
Quote: "... A lithium-ion battery provides 300-500 discharge/charge cycles. The battery prefers a partial rather than a full discharge. Frequent full discharges should be avoided when possible...Increasing internal resistance with cycle life and age is typical for cobalt-based lithium-ion, a system that is used for cell phones, cameras and laptops because of high energy density. The lower energy dense manganese-based lithium-ion, also known as spinel, maintains the internal resistance through its life but loses capacity due to chemical decompositions..."
