**Quote: "...according to our tesing, for 2.3AH high rate LiFe cell, the self-discharge rate is 4% of rated capacity per 28days...Jason's information is pretty close. We rate the cells at 5% cpacity loss per month...."

**Quote: "...The M1 cells behave differently from other Lithium technologies. The specified end of charge voltage is 3.6 volts rather than 4.2 volts....The M1 cell, on the other hand, accepts very little additional energy above 3.6V....So how do the M1 cells compare? Tests so far show that over the course of a couple of weeks, the loss of capacity is close to zero. That's a good thing!..."

The performance of the SUNHIGH's Fe- Battery is excellent for cycling at high temperature as well as for overcharge and over discharge..."
