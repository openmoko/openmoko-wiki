== Where to get  it ==
You can get everything you need [http://www.qtopia.net/modules/devices/openmoko.php from here]. Currently the flash tarball has the 2.6.21 openmoko kernel and a Qtopia phone edition jffs2 flash
image cross-compiled for the Neo. 

It appears you must clear the flash chunks first. Get into uboot console [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Uboot#Accessing_the_bootloader_prompt] and enter 

 # nand erase kernel
 # nand erase rootfs

download and use dfu-util as normal [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Flashing_openmoko] :D - Simple, Eh?

Most things seem to work out of the box, however you may need to use the following command to get audio:

 # alsactl -f /etc/alsa/gsmhandset.state restore

The lock works, yet you must push the power button, then press the # on the smallest 9-keypad in the world.

== Screenshots ==

Here are some screenshots of Qtopia runing on a Neo 1973. Personally I find it very impressive...
