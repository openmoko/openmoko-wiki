This [http://numptyphysics.garage.maemo.org/ really cool game] is available by running:
 opkg install --force-depends http://wwwpub.zih.tu-dresden.de/~mkluge/numptyphysics_0.2_armv4t.ipk
opkg complains about libsdl and libsdl-image, but I think the program should actually work on 2007.2, and Debian (?).

On Om 2008 you need to do the following:
 opkg install libsdl-1.2-0 libsdl-image-1.2-0
 opkg install -force-depends http://wwwpub.zih.tu-dresden.de/~mkluge/numptyphysics_0.2_armv4t.ipk

Use with a keyboard on. Keys:

stylus	draw a new stroke
space or enter (d-pad centre)	pause/unpause physics
esc (back arrow)	undo last stroke
q	quit
r or up	reset level to initial state
n or right	skip to next level
p or left	go to previous level
e or fullscreen	edit mode

Hints:

Each stroke is like a rigid piece of wire with a mass proportional to its length. A closed stroke is just a wire bent into a shape, it has no substance apart from its perimeter.

The ends of a strokes can (and will) join onto other strokes when drawn near enough to another stroke. These joints are pivots so you can use this to build levers, pendulums and other mechanical wonders.

Jointed strokes don't collide with each other. Join both ends to make a rigid structure
