= Show always the actual characters at the bottom =

== Modify the theme (illume.edc) file (DONE) ==

Here is the patch and a screenshot:

== Modify illume C source code (TODO, need help) ==

Checkout the illume source:
  svn co http://svn.enlightenment.org/svn/e/trunk/e/src/modules/illume

Obtaining the current word, is possibly in the e_kbd_int.c file using:
  e_kbd_buf_actual_string_get(ki->kbuf)
function call. 

Maybe we should inject our code somewhere around the line 1757:
   ki->base_obj = _theme_obj_new(ki->win->evas,
				 ki->themedir,
				 "e/modules/kbd/base/default");

Because this is the .edc object where our TEXT part is.


= Multiple mode for each dictionaries =

Current situation:
 1. Terminal type, it echoes the typed char directly.
 2. Alpha type, it autocorrect the world and inject a space after it

Proposed solution:
 1. Terminal type (like the old)
 2. Alpha type WITHOUT space (NEW) 
 3. Alpha type WITH space (like the old)

= Language specific local dictionaries =

Currently each dicitonary pollutes the same local file, 
which is memory mapped in illume keyboard.
Using multiple language concurrently degrades the dictionary accuracy 
(thats it, it propose german words in english texts and vice-versa)
