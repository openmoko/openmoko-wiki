====='''Period 2010-12-01 to 2011-01-31'''=====

== Hardware ==

In this issue we try out a new dedicated section to hardware. There has been no such section in the Community Updates mainly because after the 2008 launch of Neo FreeRunner, there hasn't been continuation to the Openmoko Inc's pioneering phone hardware with (mostly) CC-BY-SA schematics and all the other freedom joy... until now.

=== GTA04 ===

'''GTA04''' is a project by the long time distributor and hw developer, German company Golden Delicious. The name is loaned from Openmoko project because of the spiritual continuation - GTA01 was the codename for Neo1973, GTA02 was the Neo FreeRunner, and GTA03 was the canceled successor product. Besides offering improved versions of Neo FreeRunner (better battery life, better audio output), they've a complete ''replacement board'' planned to fit an existing Neo FreeRunner case and use the existing display.

The key details of GTA04 include among else:
* OMAP3530 ARMv7 CPU
* UMTS/3G (HSPA)
* USB 2.0 OTG
* WLAN, BT, FM transceiver
* Barometric Altimeter, Accelerometer, Compass, Gyroscope
* Optionally camera

Find your GTA04 information at the following addresses:
* http://www.gta04.org/ - technical: u-boot, kernel, Debian...
* http://www.handheld-linux.com/wiki.php?page=GTA04 - shopping page
* http://www.handheld-linux.com/wiki.php?page=GTA04-Early-Adopter - the early adopter program, although already finished

Latest news:
* ''gta04-owner'' mailing list founded, although occasionally you will find news also from the openmoko-community list among else; join the list at http://lists.goldelico.com/pipermail/gta04-owner/
* First engineering sample (GTA04A2) is working in PDA mode (U-Boot in NAND Flash)
* GTA04A3 is getting final PCB layout fine tuning
* UMTS (3G) modules have arrived. And GTA04 likely to have 512 MB RAM, 512 MB NAND Flash and 1GHz DM3730 CPU. http://lists.goldelico.com/pipermail/gta04-owner/2011-January/000025.html

Visit the FOSDEM in Brussels, Belgium next weekend (5th/6th of February, 2011) to see GTA04 in action and discuss about it! See http://fosdem.org/2011/ , http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/FOSDEM_2011 , http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2010-December/063899.html

==Distributions==

Distributions lists releases and other significant updates in distributions that have some support for the Openmoko devices.

=Updated Distributions=

{{DistributionBox|
Name=Debian GNU/Linux |
Description=[[Debian]] is a universal operating system used on many embedded devices, servers and home computers. Using Debian on the FreeRunner gives access to the huge army of software packaged in the Debian repositories, already compiled for the Neo's ARM(v4) processor. Moreover, one can build one's own source files for programs without having to learn the OpenEmbedded way. For an existing Debian/Ubuntu user, choosing Debian for Neo FreeRunner makes phone a very familiar, trustworthy and flexible place to hack in.<br><br>
General news:
<br>
* Third Openmoko specific Linux 2.6.34 kernel is available. Highlights:
** Merge from qtmoko-v31 (2.6.34.7 stable patches, GPS suspend patch, resume reason patch)
** Disable sysrq, unneededEXT4 support, UbiFS support
** Configuration wishlist items: NFSv4, XATTR for EXT*, CONFIG_TASK_DELAY_ACCT, CONFIG_TASK_IO_ACCOUNTING, CONFIG_OPENMOKO_RESUME_REASON
** Caveats: 1) No updated fso-config-gta02 yet in Debian, get your state files from eg. http://iki.fi/tjyrinki/moko/2.6.34/ 2) X.Org eats all the CPU unless you disable AutoAddDevices or remove extra /dev/input files, 3) Sys paths have changed, so you most probably want to add "om gsm power 1" to /etc/rc.local (and install newest omhacks from pkg-fso if you already haven't)
* Debian 6.0 is nearing completion! Planned release date is the weekend of FOSDEM, ie. 5/6th of February, 2011. For Neo FreeRunner, the Debian 6.0 status is the following:
** No Openmoko support in the Debian kernel yet, you need to install one from pkg-fso repository: http://pkg-fso.nomeata.de/sid/allpackages
** Otherwise you could survive with official, released Debian packages, but you are probably interested...
*** Newer versions of fso-config-gta02, fso-frameworkd and omhacks in pkg-fso
*** E17 wasn't released on time for Debian 6.0, so you need to get it from unstable (sid) repositories, or after the Debian 6.0 release from testing (wheezy in case of 7.0) to get for example Zhone software working

{{DistributionBox|
Name=QtMoko [v30], [v31]|
Description= Qtmoko is a Debian + qtopia based distribution for FreeRunner.

v30 is a minor update, the changelog is very short:
 
* fixed headset jack detection
* Danish translations (Ole Carlsen)
* GPRS fix (Timo Juhani Lindfors)
* battery_platform for dumb batteries as module
* force GPS power up on resume (Gennady Kupava)

v31 is a bigger update:
* First stable release using the 2.6.34 kernel
* fixed invisible call button in finximod theme (Joif)
* translated to French (Gregoire Juge)
* updated Danish translation (Ole Carlsen)
* better layout in docked keyboard
* commented completion strip in docked keyboard
* VT not switch to graphics which fixes X hang in VT_WAITACTIVE (Gennady+Me)
* fix QX crash after pause/resume
* using openssh-server instead of dropbear again|

}}

{{DistributionBox|
Name=SHR-testing RC1|
Description= The image is based on the 2010.12 release of OpenEmbedded and has latest 
versions of E, SHR and FSO apps.

Since last testing a lot has changed:
* Switch to illume2 as illume(1) isn't maintained anymore
* Switch from ogsmd to much faster fsogsmd
* Switch to 2.6.34 kernel (without KMS because this causes some problems with SD-cards for some SHR-u users)
* Everything faster ;)
* And much more i don't remember

Known Bugs:
* There is a problem with the autostart of applications in E, because of that the shr_elm_softkey is not always started.
* The wizard is only working if you wait until FSO is fully started (When FSO is started the display started dimming). If you don't want to wait that long you can exit the wizard with the "Exit" button and do the configurations in shr-settings afterwards.

Untested:
* All feed packages not in the full image.
* All day usage (so GPRS/GPS after several suspends)
