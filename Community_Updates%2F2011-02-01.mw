==Distributions==
=Updated Distributions=
{{DistributionBox|
Name=QtMoko [v30]|

* fixed headset jack detection
* Danish translations (Ole Carlsen)
* GPRS fix (Timo Juhani Lindfors)

Codename='v30'|

Works={{Works_on_QtMoko}}
}}

{{DistributionBox|
Name=SHR-testing RC1|
Description= The image is based on the 2010.12 release of OpenEmbedded and has latest 
versions of E, SHR and FSO apps.

Since last testing a lot has changed:
* Switch to illume2 as illume(1) isn't maintained anymore
* Switch from ogsmd to much faster fsogsmd
* Switch to 2.6.34 kernel (without KMS because this causes some problems with SD-cards for some SHR-u users)
* Everything faster ;)
* And much more i don't remember

Known Bugs:
* There is a problem with the autostart of applications in E, because of that the shr_elm_softkey is not always started.
* The wizard is only working if you wait until FSO is fully started (When FSO is started the display started dimming). If you don't want to wait that long you can exit the wizard with the "Exit" button and do the configurations in shr-settings afterwards.

Untested:
* All feed packages not in the full image.
* All day usage (so GPRS/GPS after several suspends)
