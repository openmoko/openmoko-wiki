Auxlaunch is a simple, "finger-friendly" app launcher for the Neo Freerunner (open source cell phone). It (optionally) appears when the "AUX" button is pressed. The top on-screen button changes function when the on-screen buttons below are pressed.<br>
<br>

__TOC__

== Operation ==

Use the top, on-screen button to launch an application, enter a menu group, or switch to another window. To cycle through apps, groups, or windows, press the on-screen buttons below.<br>
<br>
The top button changes function based on the most recently used adjust (arrow) buttons.<br>
<br>
The app launch items are configured in a comma delimited text file (.auxlaunchrc) in the user's home directory. Items such as "Suspend", "Cancel", and "Quit" can be configured too. Auxlaunch uses stock GTK icons or images from files.<br>
<br>
Note: Auxlaunch is beta may be a bit rough around the edges. :-) 
<br>
== Configuration ==

Edit the "~/.auxlaunchrc" file.<br>
<ol>
<li>Create a new menu group (for items that follow) with a line containing group name in quotes followed by a comma.</li>
<li>For item icons, specify a stock GTK icon identifier or a path to an existing image.</li>
<li>Use "(quit)", "(cancel)", or "(reload)" to create items to hide Auxlaunch, stop Auxlaunch, or reread Auxlaunch's configuration.
<li>Use a "-" in the first column to indicate titles of windows that should not appear in the window-switching list.</li>
</ol>
<br>

== Options ==

Use: "auxlaunch -option1 -option2". Command line options include:

<ul>
<li>-dms    = Include items from Debian Menu System.</li>
<li>-nowm   = No window manager. (Do not show window switching buttons).</li>
<li>-right  = Swap app-launchning and window-switching buttons (right for left).</li>
<li>-hide   = Cause AUX button to hide auxlaunch (when it is displayed).</li>
<li>-simple = Use "change" buttons for grp/app/win selecting (instead of up/down buttons).</li>
<li>-noaux  = Do not react to AUX button. (Run auxlaunch again to unhide.)</li>
</ul>
<br>
== Installation ==

Python and PyGTK are required. Package "wmctrl" is required for window (app) switching. If installing by hand, make sure to place the ".auxlaunchrc" file in your  home directory.
