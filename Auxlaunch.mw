Auxlaunch is a simple, "finger-friendly" app launcher and optional window-switcher. It appears when the "AUX" button is pressed. The top button changes when the buttons below are pressed.<br>
<br>

__TOC__

== Operation ==

Use the top button to launch an application, enter a group (menu), or switch to another window. To cycle through apps, groups, or windows, press the buttons below.<br>
<br>
The top button changes function based on the most recently used adjust (arrow) buttons.<br>
<br>
The app launch items are configured in a comma delimited text file (.auxlaunchrc). Items such as "Suspend", "Cancel", and "Quit" can be configured too. Auxlaunch uses stock GTK icons or images from files.<br>
<br>
Note: Auxlaunch is, of course, very beta and, so far, only tested in Debian.
<br>
== Configuration ==

Edit the ".auxlaunchrc" file.<br>
<ol>
<li>Create a new group (for items that follow) with a line containing group name in quotes followed by a comma.</li>
<li>For item icons, specify a stock GTK icon identifier or a path to an existing image.</li>
<li>Use " &" at end of command to run in background.</li>
<li>Use "(quit)", "(cancel)", or "(reload)" to create items to hide Auxlaunch, stop Auxlaunch, or reread Auxlaunch's configuration.
</ol>
<br>

== Options ==

Use: "auxlaunch -option1 -option2". Command line options include:

<ul>
<li>-dms = Include items from Debian Menu System.</li>
<li>-nowm = No window manager. (Do not show window switching buttons).</li>
<li>-right = Swap app-launchning and window-switching buttons (right for left).</li>
<li>-hide = Cause AUX button to hide Auxlaunch (when it is displayed).</li>
<li>-simple = Use "change" buttons for grp/app/win selecting (instead of up/down buttons).</li>
</ul>
<br>
== Installation ==

Python and PyGTK are required. Package "wmctrl" is required for window (app) switching.
