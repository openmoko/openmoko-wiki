Auxlaunch is a very simple, finger-friendly application launcher for the Freerunner. It appears when the "AUX" button is pressed. The top buttons change when the up/down buttons below are pressed.

To launch an app, press the top left button ("left for launch"). The apps are configured in a comma delimited text file (.auxlaunchrc). Items such as "Suspend", "Cancel", and "Quit" can be configured too. Auxlaunch uses stock GTK icons or images from files.

To switch to a currently running app (window), press the top right button. If you don't like this feature, then specify "-nowm" when running "auxlaunch" (i.e. "auxlaunch -nowm"). This will hide the right-hand, app switching buttons.

Python and PyGTK are required. Package "wmctrl" is required for window (app) switching. A screenshot (shown along with the cool openmoko-panel-plugin) is below.

Note: Auxlaunch is, of course, beta and, so far, only tested in Debian.
