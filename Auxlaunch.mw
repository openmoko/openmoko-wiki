Auxlaunch is a simple app launcher for the Freerunner. It appears when the "AUX" button is pressed. The top button changes when the up/down buttons are pressed. To launch the selected app, press the top button. 

The apps are configured in a comma delimited text file (.auxlaunchrc). Items such as "Suspend", "Cancel", and "Quit" can be configured too. Auxlaunch uses stock GTK icons or images from files. Python and PyGTK are required. 

Note: Auxlaunch is, of course, beta and so far only tested in Debian.
