Auxlaunch is a very simple, finger-friendly application launcher and window switcher for the Freerunner. It appears when the "AUX" button is pressed. The top buttons change when the up/down buttons below are pressed.

__TOC__

== Operation ==

To launch an app, press the top left button. To switch to a currently running app (window), press the top right button. Use the arrow keys in the 2nd and 3rd row to change the launch or window-switch buttons above them.

The launch items are configured in a comma delimited text file (.auxlaunchrc). Items such as "Suspend", "Cancel", and "Quit" can be configured too. Auxlaunch uses stock GTK icons or images from files.

Note: Auxlaunch is, of course, very beta and, so far, only tested in Debian.

== Options ==

Command line options include:

<ul>
<li>"-nowm" hides the window-switching buttons.</li>
<li>"-right" swaps button columns (left/right).</li>
<li>"-dms" creates additional items from Debian Menu System (only those that specify needs="x11")</li> </ul>

== Installation ==

Python and PyGTK are required. Package "wmctrl" is required for window (app) switching.

(Also, yeah, it is kind of silly to configure Auxlaunch with an "Auxlaunch" button. But I thought it'd make for a good screenshot.)
