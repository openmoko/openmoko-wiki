There are two areas in which other OSes can take a part in OpenMoko.
First, not everybody will use Linux to download (and/or develop) software into their phones; we call this the Host OS.
Secondly, it is possible that some people may wish to run alternate OSes on their phone itself.

== Alternate Host OS ==

=== Microsoft Windows ===

(link to this page...)

=== Mac OS X ===

Covered elsewhere; see [[MacOS_X]]. They have dfu-util and ether-gadget working.

=== OpenBSD ===

The cdce(4) driver works fine with OpenMoko's ethergadget interface, so you can scp ipkg files then ssh in and install them.

[[User:Idarwin|Ian Darwin]] has a port of dfu-util partly working (list works but not download).

== Alternate Software In the Neo Phone ==

=== JavaFX Mobile ===

At JavaOne, Sun demonstrated JavaFX running in the phone. Although based on a similar Linux kernel, this is a completely different user-mode stack.

=== OpenedHand ===

This Linux-based project claims to have "experimental" support, but it is based on 2007.02 firmware.

=== Windows CE? ===

Windows CE runs on some Arm-based handhelds, so it is theoretically possible.

=== Other OSes? ===
