There are two areas in which other OSes can take a part in OpenMoko.
First, not everybody will use Linux to download (and/or develop) software into their phones; we call this the Host OS.
Secondly, it is possible that some people may wish to run alternate OSes on their phone itself.

== Alternate Host OS ==

=== Microsoft Windows ===

(link to this page...)

=== Mac OS X ===

Covered elsewhere; see [[MacOS_X]]. They have dfu-util and ether-gadget working.

=== OpenBSD ===

The cdce(4) driver works "out of the box" with OpenMoko's ethergadget interface, so you can ssh in, run remote X clients, scp in or out, etc.

[[User:Idarwin|Ian Darwin]] has a port of dfu-util partly working (list works but not download).

== Alternate Software In the Neo Phone ==

=== Other Linux Distros ===

* JavaFX Mobile -- At JavaOne, Sun demonstrated JavaFX running in the phone. Although based on a similar Linux kernel, this is a completely different user-mode stack.
*[[Angstrom_on_Neo1973|Angstrom]]
*[http://www.o-hand.com OpenedHand] provides http://pokylinux.org/

=== Windows CE? ===

Windows CE runs on some Arm-based handhelds, so it is theoretically possible.

=== Other OSes? ===

Anything other than Linux or WinCE?
