If you use a non-Linux desktop (we call this the ''host OS''), you can find useful information in this article about connecting to your Openmoko smartphone or running/developing Openmoko software.


== Microsoft Windows ==

* dfu-util for Windows: [[Dfu-util-windows]]
* USB and Bluetooth Networking: [[Neo 1973 and Windows]]

== Mac OS X ==

Covered elsewhere; see [[MacOS_X]]. They have dfu-util and ether-gadget working.

== FreeBSD ==

qemu-neo1973 works see [[Talk:Openmoko_under_QEMU#FreeBSD_and_last_qemu...]]. Nothing else known. See [[FreeBSD]]

== NetBSD ==

We have an experimental [[NetBSD|NetBSD/evbarm Neo1973 kernel]] booting on [[Talk:Openmoko under QEMU#NetBSD.2Fi386|Qemu Neo1973 emulator on NetBSD]].

== OpenBSD ==

The umodem(4) driver works with the u-boot console. When the umodem driver claims device 0x1457:0x5118, it becomes inaccessible to libusb-based applications such as dfu-util. The cdce(4) driver works "out of the box" with Openmoko's ethergadget interface, so you can ssh in, run remote X clients, scp in or out, etc.

[[User:Idarwin|Ian Darwin]] has a port of dfu-util partly working (list works but not download).
