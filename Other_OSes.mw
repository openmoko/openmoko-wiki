There are two areas in which other OSes can take a part in OpenMoko.
First, not everybody will use Linux to download (and/or develop) software into their phones; we call this the Host OS.
Secondly, it is possible that some people may wish to run alternate OSes on their phone itself.

== Alternate Host OS ==

=== Microsoft Windows ===

(link to this page...)

=== Mac OS X ===

Covered elsewhere; see [[MacOS_X]]. They have dfu-util and ether-gadget working.

=== OpenBSD ===

The cdce(4) driver works "out of the box" with OpenMoko's ethergadget interface, so you can ssh in, run remote X clients, scp in or out, etc.

[[User:Idarwin|Ian Darwin]] has a port of dfu-util partly working (list works but not download).

== Alternate Software In the Neo Phone ==

The OpenMoko project has invested a lot of time & energy in making the OpenMoko software stack work nicely on the Neo1973 phone. But it is your phone and, unlike most providers, they will not stop you from running whatever you like on the "bare metal" of the phone itself. And some people are never satisfied with a device until they've flashed the firmware multiple times. Here are some alternatives.

=== Other Linux Distros ===

* JavaFX Mobile -- At JavaOne, Sun demonstrated JavaFX running in the phone. Although based on a similar Linux kernel, this is a completely different user-mode stack.
*[[Angstrom_on_Neo1973|Angstrom]]
*[http://www.o-hand.com OpenedHand] provides http://pokylinux.org/

=== Windows CE? ===

Windows CE runs on some Arm-based handhelds, so it is theoretically possible.

=== Other OSes? ===

Anything other than Linux or WinCE?
