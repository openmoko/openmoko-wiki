== Possible GPS applications ==

As people develop more sophisticated GPS applications, please note them here.

=== Use cases ===

* I want to look at maps. 
* I want to be able to prepare data and load my own maps.
* I want to load map data in a WKB (well known binary) format such as shapefiles.
* I want to go somewhere; please tell me how to get there. Routing.
* I want to help with the [[Openstreetmap]] project by collecting data.
* I want to use [[Openstreetmap]] data in a map viewer.
* I want to use the smartphone GPS to go [[Geocaching]]
* I want the GPS to update profile settings based on my location. Example, mute the phone ringer when I am at work.
* I want to log GPS data for later analysis.
* I want to collect GPS data for scientific field work (forestry, biology, etc)

See [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2007-July/007252.html for another collection of ideas.

=== Applications software ===

'''Please note if a program works or if it's vapourware.'''

* Cairo-based mapping (I wonder what this is?)
* [http://www.kflog.org/cumulus/ Cumulus] GPS software for glider pilots (and pilots in general), has a port for Qtopia and pulls (world) maps from the KFLog flight planner project. I think someone has put a project like this on the projects website * [http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Pyroute Pyroute] is a routing program written in Python by Ojw, and a mobile phone GUI for maps, GPS, and routing.
:* [http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Rana Ran&aacute;] is the new version of pyroute
* [http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Gosmore Gosmore] is a routing and viewer of OSM XML data such as the planet.osm.
* [[GPS Sight]], a popular Openmoko project under LGPL.
* [[GPS-Trail]] a simple trail logger.
* [[GPS_Navigation#roadmap|roadmap]] mapping system using freely available maps (US census TIGER, DGLib, shapefiles).
* [[Navit]] a car navigation system with routing engine.
* [http://svn.projects.openmoko.org/svnroot/openmoko-agpsui Openmoko AGPS UI project].* [[Orrery]], an unpopular Openmoko project for displaying the night sky.
* [[qpegps]] qtopia (arm PDA) based map viewer with gps features
* [[QMapControl]] Qtopia based mapping widget. Displays maps and custom data, also other widgets can be bound to coordinates. GPS parser for the gllin output included.
[http://projects.openmoko.org/projects/openvario/ here].
* [http://www.tangogps.org TangoGPS] mapping program. Downloads maps on demand and caches them, very efficient. '''Works very well.'''
