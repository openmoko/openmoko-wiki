GpsDrive is a car (bike, ship, plane) navigation system. GpsDrive displays your position provided from your GPS receiver on a zoomable map. The maps are autoselected for best resolution depending of your position and can be downloaded from the Internet. Speech output is supported if the "festival" software is running. All GPS receivers supported by gpsd should be usable. more at [http://www.gpsdrive.de/ homepage]

{{ApplicationBox|
Name=RoadMap|
Description=RoadMap displays a map of the streets, tracks the position provided the GPS receiver, identifies the street matching this GPS position and announces the name of the crossing street at the next intersection. A trip feature allows RoadMap to display routes, tracks, and provide some basic navigation information (distance to the next waypoint, direction, speed, etc..). Voice messages are generated that duplicate some of the screen information.|
