USB is the Universal Serial Bus, the standard wired connection between computers and accessories. 

In Openmoko and the [[Neo1973]], the following USB techniques are working, or are currently being implemented:

* [[USB Product IDs]]
* [[USB DFU]] firmware uploads during [[u-boot]]
* [[USB CDC ACM]] serial terminal for use during [[u-boot]]
* [[USB Networking]] when booted to Linux
* [[Battery Charger]]
* [[USB host]]
* [[Specialized USB cables]]

Both the Neo 1973 and the Neo FreeRunner have a standard 5-pin mini-USB type-B (slave) socket and ship with a cable to connect it to a host computer. The Neo FreeRunner additionally ships with a charger that connects via this port.
