Our Openmoko Wiki Editing Guidelines are meant to assist our users in editing this wiki. They try to ensure a somewhat more consistent and organized structure. If you would like to add additional guidelines or to modify existing ones please use the [https://lists.openmoko.org/mailman/listinfo/documentation documentation mailing list] or the [[Talk:Openmoko Wiki Editing Guidelines|talk page]] to discuss your changes first.

== Naming ==

# Openmoko refers only to the software (think Openmoko GNU/Linux distribution), not to any of the devices
# Neo 1973 is the first hardware device that officially runs Openmoko, Neo FreeRunner is the second
# Use "the smartphone" if you refer to a hardware device that could be Neo 1973 but could also be a later version

== Rules ==

# If you see an error, correct it!
# If you see a page that is mis-categorized, correct it!
# If you're adding information (especially pages) about the hardware, keep in mind that the Neo 1973 is only one of the various devices that will run Openmoko. Thus,
## Do not create generic pages like "Battery", rather use "Neo 1973 Battery".
## If it makes sense to have generic pages, use per-device sections and make sure you always link to the Neo 1973 section from other Neo 1973 specific pages.
## See [[Openmoko_Wiki_Editing_Guidelines#Style Sheet|Style sheet]] section for a list of other definitive spellings used in the Openmoko project.
# The wiki is primarily meant to contain factual information on actual project software, hardware, even though parts might still be under development. Thus,
## If you're adding information about wishlist items (or even more imaginary things), please clearly mark them with a "Wishlist:" prefix in the page title.
## Always make sure that an outside user can clearly distinguish between the actual feature set of the device, and "interesting theoretical plans of what one could do if he had time" :)
# Avoid duplication! Multiple sources often get out of sync, leading to confusion and mis-information. If you have new information see if it is an appropriate addition to an existing page. If you do feel that a new page is in order, remove duplicated information from the existing page and consolidate in your new page.
# Use categories! We are trying to use categories as a way to help newcomers find what they want. Proper categorization of your new page or any existing pages will help bring your valuable information to the eyes of the user, and will help raise the level of usefulness of the entire wiki

== Text editing ==

These pages explain how to write and format text:

* [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikitext_examples MediaWiki Wikitext Examples]
* [[Help:Editing]]
* [http://www.crockford.com/wrrrld/style.html Elements of Style]. Knowing these 18 rules of good style is a must for anybody writing in English.
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style Wikipedia's Manual of Style]

== Use categories ==

Adding categories to a page allows the wiki engine to organize the content automagically. This allows readers to find information in an organized way.

* Add a category at the bottom of the pages you create, select the most-accurate category for the page. 
* If a page truly fits in multiple categories, OK, but the wiki will be more organized if you pick the one most-accurate category only.
* Review the existing category hierarchy on the [[:Category:Categories]] page. (Be sure to press the + buttons to see the subcategories.)
* A [[Special:Categories|complete list of all categories]] is also available.

Assigning your page to categories:

<pre>
  [[Category:My selected category]]
  [[Category:My new category]]
</pre>

=== Creating new categories ===

If a category does not exist and you think a new one is required then add your page to the not-existing category as described above.

Be sure to click on the new category link and define what you were thinking should go into this category by editing the '''category page'''. Please be brief so readers will easily see the automatically indexed page links below your introduction text.

<pre>
{{Languages|:Category:My new category}}

Category description

[[Category:Parent category]]
</pre>

=== Linking to a category page ===

To link to a category page within the page text:

<pre>
  [[:Category:My new category | My new category]]
</pre>

For more help on categories, please see [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Categories MediaWiki's "Categories" help page.]

== Use templates ==

Please see available [[Templates]] and add them where necessary.

=== Navigation templates ===

Exemples: [[Template:Om_2008.8]], [[Template:OM2007.2]]

These are most useful to present small sets of chronological or otherwise 
well ordered information items. For example, it's obvious to offer navigation 
templates between these articles:
* Openmoko produced smartphones {GTA01 Neo 1973, GTA02 Neo FreeRunner, GTA 03 
(speculative)}
* Distributions {2007.1, 2007.2, 2008.8 ASU, 2008.9, FSO, SHR, Qtopia, Debian}

In effect navigation templates create a subset of important pages presented sequentially. This corresponds more or less to a chapter in the user manual. We should not force them where they cannot create a CONSISTENT  forth-and-back navigation between a GROUP OF PAGES.

== List pages ==

List pages are manually maintained lists of links to a certain set of articles. Their purpose is similar to category pages' automatic article listing, but they can provide advantages above the automatic lists, like sections, better formatting, sorting, etc.

A list page is only justified if it gives value added to the reader by
* Making a thematic selection of quality links within and/or outside the Wiki
* Providing a well thought out logical organization that makes it easy to  find information
* Offering a good formatting consistent with the above goal. List pages should be not be painful to maintain. Comprehensive lists of pages cannot be kept up to date and are better made automatically using categories.

You are welcome to create and improve list pages which match these recommendations.

==Special pages==

These guidelines are for special pages from one of the following categories.

=== Application info pages ===

[[Image:No-screenshot.png|150px|right]]
Software available for Openmoko smartphones are collected on special list pages and categories to make it easy to find. 

When you add or find an a page describing a single application always:

* Assign the application page to the corresponding [[:Category:Applications|application category]].
* Add an ApplicationBox Template to it. Usage is described on the [[Template talk:ApplicationBox|ApplicationBox template's talk page]].
* [[Template talk:ApplicationBox|Transclude]] (that's a Wiki expression to include a page or section in another page) the ApplicationBox on one of the "List of x Applications" pages.
* Add a link to the application page on [[Applications]].
* Use this image if you don't have a screenshot.

===Manuals===

All information on using phones or distributions should be included in the manuals, which should be subpages of the [[Manuals]] page.

The Manuals are organized in two categories: device-manuals and distribution-manuals. Device-manuals (e.g. [[Manuals/Neo FreeRunner]]) contain any instructions that are specific to a certain device, while distribution-manuals (e.g. [[Manuals/Om 2008]] contain only information on a certain distribution. 

Rules:
* Only include information on how to USE a certain phone/distribution - general information on phones/distributions should be located on other pages.
* Use as few links as possible: If there is a term that needs explanation, try to do this in the manual.
