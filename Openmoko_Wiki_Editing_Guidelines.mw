Our Openmoko Wiki Editing Guidelines are meant to assist our users in editing this wiki.  They try to ensure a somewhat more consistent and organized structure.


== Naming ==

# Openmoko refers only to the software (think Openmoko GNU/Linux distribution), not to any of the devices
# Neo 1973 is the first hardware device that officially runs Openmoko, Neo FreeRunner is the second
# Use "the smartphone" if you refer to a hardware device that could be Neo 1973 but could also be a later version

== Rules ==

# If you're adding information (especially pages) about the hardware, keep in mind that the Neo 1973 is only one of the various devices that will run Openmoko. Thus,
## Do not create generic pages like "Battery", rather use "Neo 1973 Battery".
## If it makes sense to have generic pages, use per-device sections and make sure you always link to the Neo 1973 section from other Neo 1973 specific pages.
## See [[Openmoko_Wiki_Editing_Guidelines#Style Sheet|Style sheet]] section for a list of other definitive spellings used in the Openmoko project.
# The wiki is primarily meant to contain factual information on actual project software, hardware, even though parts might still be under development. Thus,
## If you're adding information about wishlist items (or even more imaginary things), please clearly mark them with a "Wishlist:" prefix in the page title.
## Always make sure that an outside user can clearly distinguish between the actual feature set of the device, and "interesting theoretical plans of what one could do if he had time" :)

== Adding a new page ==

To start a new page you can either create a link to it first on another page, like this: 

 <nowiki>[[My new page]]</nowiki>

then click the resulting link and start editing the new page, or you can add your new page name to the URL in your browser's address-bar, like this: 

 <nowiki>http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/My_new_page</nowiki>

and create the page first, before linking to it, or allow the wiki nannies to do the linking for you... they will see your page show up here:

http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Special:Recentchanges

== Use categories ==

Adding [[Special:Categories | categories]] to a page allows the wiki engine to organize the content automagically. This allows readers to find information in an organized way.

* Please add a category at the bottom of the pages you create, trying to select the one most-accurate category for the page. 
* If a page truly fits in multiple categories, OK, but the wiki will be more organized if you pick the one most-accurate category.
* Review the existing category hierarchy on the [[:Category:Categories]] page. (Be sure to press the + buttons to see the subcategories.)
* A complete flat list of categories is available on the special [[Special:Categories|categories]] page.
* If a category does not exist and you think a new one is required then use the same category syntax to create a new one.

To add your page to a category:

<pre>
  [[Category:My selected category]]
  [[Category:My new category]]
</pre>

If you are creating a new category, then be sure to click on the new category link and define what you were thinking should go into this category. Please be brief so readers will easily see the automatically indexed page links below your introduction text.

To link to a category page within the page text:
<pre>
  [[:Category:My new category | My new category]]
</pre>

For more help on categories, please see [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Categories MediaWiki's "Categories" help page.]
