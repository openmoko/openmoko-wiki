The internal flash memory is divided into partitions of several uses. The exact partition sizes are stored in the [[bootloader]] environment variable "mtdblocks", and depend on [[bad blocks]] of each device. [[Flashing the Neo FreeRunner]] updates partition contents.

GTA02 partitions different from [[Neo 1973 Partitions|GTA01 partitions]], it comes with extra factory partition for productions.
