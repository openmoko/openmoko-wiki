'''sms-sentry''' is an application which lets you locate your phone if it is lost or stolen. Upon sending an SMS with the text sentry:location to your phone, the phone will turn on GPS, wait for a fix and send back an SMS with the current location.

[[openBmap]] and [[Cellhunter]] are projects with the objective to collect GPS location of GSM network cells. If this project is finished then SMS-sentry could send a rough location just by identifying the current distances (strength of signal) to the available GSM network cells, even when the GPS satellites are not available (e.g. in a house).
