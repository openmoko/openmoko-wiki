It gets the current position from the gps system and downloads nearby routes. Then you can follow them with [[TangoGPS]] application. You need to be online for this feature. Otherwise you have to select your route before, download and transfer the route to your phone. You can also upload your favorite bicycle tour on the web to share the tour with others.
