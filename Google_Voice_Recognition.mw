Because the performance of your Freerunner is too poor for voice recognition, the Google Voice API can be used to convert an recorded Audio file into a text string. Be aware that the audio file will be transmitted to Google, so  need to have Internet access on your freerunner FR to submit the audio file. You must be aware of the fact, that the follow script is running on your freerunner but it is not a standalone voice recognition software and so you might not want to use this tool for personal audio files
