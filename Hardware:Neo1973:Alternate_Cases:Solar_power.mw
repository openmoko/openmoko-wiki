Alternate case for the Neo1973, with a solar panel for recharging the battery.

==Design options==
The panel could be mounted on some or all of the six sides of the phone, depending upon the amount of power needed, the environment and the power produced by the panel.

|16. [[User:Tommy|Tommy]] That would be wonderful. I'd rather buy a first version without the solar panel quick and then also buy the next version, than have to wait even more if you were to include the solar panel on the first mass market version. But if you could hire someone else to do it for you and the decision would only affect the price and not the release date I would want you to include it in the first mass market version.

|-
|18. [[User:gwylim|gwylim]] That would be cool, but I'll buy it without anyway.
|-
|19. [[User:yorick|yorick]] That would be very interesting, if it could generate enough power. Otherwise I might go for a kinetic charger.
