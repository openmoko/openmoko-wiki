Openmoko has been assigned the OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) 00-1F-11. This page lists allocations we have made under this OUI.

==MAC addresses==

MAC addresses as used for various link-layers such as Ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth, are of the form xx-xx-xx-yy-yy-yy where xx-xx-xx is the OUI (00-1F-11) and yy-yy-yy is an identifier assigned by the owner of the OUI.

== Open registry for community / homebrew OUI ranges ==

As the openmoko products have been discontinued, Openmoko Inc. is opening up the use of its IEEE OUI range for use by the Free and Open Source software and hardware communities.  This means you can simply register your devices and will get an allocation of a OUI range for free.

=== Existing Allocations ===

The current list of allocations can be found at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openmoko/openmoko-usb-oui/master/ieee_oui.psv

=== Conditions ===

By applying for an Openmoko OUI range, you acknowledge that either
* the device you are developing is either an open hardware project with at least publicly available schematics, '''or'''
* the firmware/software running on your Ethernet device is Free / Open Source software, licensed under an OSI-Approved, FSF-Recognized or DFSG-Approved Free / Open Source software license

In order to request an OUI range, please send an pull-request to the https://github.com/openmoko/openmoko-usb-oui github project.

Please make sure the commitlog message of your pull requests contains
the following details:
* a name and short description of your Ethernet enabled device project
* the license under which you are releasing the hardware and/or software/firmware of the device
* a link to the project website and/or source code repository, if any
* the number of Unique MAC addresses you require, with some explanation why (i.e. intended production quantity, ..)
