OpenMoko has been assigned the OUI 00-1F-11. This page lists allocations we have made under this OUI.

==MAC addresses==

MAC addresses are of the form xx-xx-xx-yy-yy-yy where xx-xx-xx is the OUI and yy-yy-yy is an identifier assigned
by the owner of the OUI.

==Generating MAC addresses==

We currently assign MAC addresses in groups of three, randomized within each block of assigned addresses.
To assign addresses, calculate how large a block you'll need. E.g., for 5000 groups, the block would have
to be at least 15'000 or 0x3A98 addresses wide. Since we like round numbers, round up to 0x4000 (unless
we know exactly how many we'll use, of course).

The '''mac''' tool can help with address generation. If we want to allocate the above block starting at
02-00-00, we could use the following command:

<PRE>
% cd svn.internal.openmoko.org/developer/werner/mac
% ./mac 020000 023fff >020000-023FFF
</PRE>

Then check the output from '''mac''' into SVN and enter the registration in this page.

Note that '''mac''' produces a different order of addresses for each invocation.
