[[USB]] CDC (Communications Device Class) ACM (Abstract Control Model) is a vendor-independent publicly documented protcol that can be used for emulating serial ports over USB.

== Hardware specifics ==

=== Neo1973 and CDC ACM ===

The Neo1973 [[u-boot]] boot loader contains support for obtaining the boot loader prompt over USB CDC ACM.

The OpenMoko kernel also contains CDC ACM device support, contained in the '''g_serial.ko''' kernel module.

=== Host PC and CDC ACM ===

==== Linux ====

Linux has a generic CDC ACM host-side implementation in the kernel module '''cdc_acm.ko'''

==== Windows ====

FIXME

==== MacOS X ====

MacOS X has a CDC ACM host-side implementation.  

FIXME: Check which bits we need to change in [[u-boot]] to make it work.

The Neo1973 has been reported to work with AjZaurusUSB available from http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/26581
