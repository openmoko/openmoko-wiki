Hi! This is the ninth [[Community Updates]], January 12th issue. For the new year we [http://n2.nabble.com/Questions-and-Answers-tp2103754p2103754.html interviewed Sean] on everything that matters for the community: sales in 2008 were around the low five digits, om-locations is what remains of an ambitious mesh network project, and the most surprising development to him was the explosion of distributions. Back on the mailing lists, activity was rater slow during the first week of the year, but got more intense than ever after the holidays. Illume's keyboard received lots of localisations. Opkg.org reached the critical mass of packages. SHR and FSO are counting down toward their next milestone, while coding continues for kernel, drivers, Android and the like. It looks like the switch to 2.6.28 is going to happen soonish, before the switch to the Paroli phone stack.

== Distributions ==
* SHR: According to Julien's latest on [http://blog.shr-project.org/ the SHR project blog], the baby is [http://blog.shr-project.org/2009/01/release-time-is-close-whats-left-what-are-we-doing-what-do-we-need.html expected really soon now].
* Marek announced the new [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2009-January/039227.html organisation of package and images repositories].
* Android: The [http://n2.nabble.com/New-openmoko-android-binary-tp2133865.html;cid=1230847584604-21 latest compatible kernel] has wifi and bluetooth working now. Suspend and resume work, but they have some usability issues.
* [[FSO]] MS5 should branch out for really soon now (the roadmap says release January 31st, but they want a longer stabilization period this time). It will be the first milestone that will have support not only for GTA01 and 02, but also for the Motorola EZX A780. [http://www.freesmartphone.org/index.php/Meeting_2008-12-18_Braunschweig meeting minutes].
* Hackable:1 [http://lists.hackable1.org/pipermail/hackable1-dev/2009-January/000104.html buildbot is up and running]. Images are generated every morning around 4:00. Happy testing !
* [[User:Bytestore]] has updated assemblage 2008.12 from Russian community, work with gprs, headphone jack plug, ru keyboard and many other things were [http://openmoko.spb.ru/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=11 updated] (download [http://dl.linuxphone.ru/openmoko/images/bytestore/bytestore-rootfs-OM200812-2009-01-11-112312.jffs2 rootfs], see [http://dl.linuxphone.ru/openmoko/images/bytestore/screenshot_2009_01_11_112312_en screenshots])

== New applications ==

* [[LED clock]] When an Openmoko is sitting unused at night, turn it into an alarm clock with large 7-segment digits on a black background in landscape mode.
* [http://projects.openmoko.org/projects/gprssettings/ GPRSsettings] is a GUI script designed to change apn, login, dialnumber.
* Samuel's script for [http://blog.samuelpereira.net/?p=4 a toggle wifi icon].
* [http://www.opkg.org/package_86.html ylock] 0.1 Python screen lock and low battery monits.
* [http://www.opkg.org/package_85.html AppManager] 1.0.1 Zenity package manager.
* Mirko [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2009-January/039376.html announced] that pre-alpha [[Paroli]] was now packaged in testing. Development [http://charlie137-2.blogspot.com/2009/01/paroli-get-website.html moved] to their own domain: [http://www.paroli-project.org/ paroli-project] hosts trac, git, blog and documentation.
* Kurt's [[Gwaterpas]] allows to use the Freerunner as a leveling tool.
* There are now 75 packages at [http://opkg.org opkg.org]. Novelties include osmupdater (updates OSM maps directory), sortdesk (sorts the desk), MokoCard (flashcards learning aid), sms-sentry (query the unit's location by SMS, handy if it was just stolen), pyring (a key ring), EFpLayer (mplayer GUI), playstankontakarta (an icon displaying remaining credit with POLISH PLAY pre-paid phone provider), various illume keyboards and more. It was mentioned unofficially that Openmoko's community repository is going to be dismantled.

== Ports and updates ==
* Lots of [[Navit]] activity. Distributions are kindly suggested to package the sample map separately from the main binary to conserve space.
* The [[opkg]] package manager development [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/opkg-devel/2008-December/000181.html moved from OM svn to Google code]. The recommended stable version is r172, there is a significant data structures+algorithm refactorization going on.
* Version 2.4 of [[orrery]] is now available.   It has a new schematic Solar System View page, showing the position of the planets and our moon in their orbits, a new moon calendar, and a less ugly icon.
* The [[ZOMG!]] package manager is now available on [http://www.opkg.org/package_96.html opkg.org], and now allows to add/remove/edit repositories (i.e. feeds).
* Angus [http://www.mail-archive.com/community@lists.openmoko.org/msg37043.html updated BtGPS.py] to work with FSO. With this script, [[Neo FreeRunner GPS#Bluetooth GPS relay|the FreeRunner works as a bluetooth GPS]].
* Marco shared his [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2009-January/039370.html success in compiling the latest E17 svn] on 2008.12. There was trouble on SHR with the Elementary widget set, tough.

== Community ==
* Sean's [http://n2.nabble.com/Questions-and-Answers-tp2103754p2103754.html new year interview]
* Rakshat Hooja's company IDA Systems will be at Mumbai's TechFest. There are [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2009-January/039505.html gifts] waiting for the first 10 FreeRunner owners to show up at their booth!
* The [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/devel/2009-January/004064.html Future of location services] thread started as an attempt to clarify the GPS drivers tangle, and then turned to using GSM celltowers and wifi access points location information. Dima [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/devel/2009-January/004074.html signalled that] there are several free databases of GSM tower locations, and that his gta02 Perl script to query [http://www.opencellid.org/ OpenCellID] for the approximate tower location, and then initialize the AGPS with this data works great. There is a database of Wifi access points at [http://wigle.net/ wigle.net].
* Two new mailing lists were announced. One to discuss [https://lists.openmoko.org/mailman/listinfo/testing testing of all Openmoko Products]. The other to discuss [http://lists.projects.openmoko.org/mailman/listinfo/siteadmin-general projects.openmoko.org] administration. While we are at it, here are the number of subscriptions as of 07/01/2009 according to Werner: hardware 670, kernel 692, support 1016, devel 1262, community 2323, announce 11258.
* The Department CSIE of National Chung Cheng University [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=CSIE&go=Go launched dozens of projects] this week.

== Hardware and drivers ==
* Werner [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/hardware/2008-December/000890.html announced] he made an [http://www.almesberger.net/misc/idbg/ debug board] that fits inside the case. Schematics contributed as a community member, not as an Openmoko employee.
* Filter AUX key bouncing [http://git.openmoko.org/?p=kernel.git;a=commit;h=39a497b0421174c3f23ef3dffb0675a4db3aa3a0 patches].
* There is a thread about the [[Touchscreen Filters|touchscreen driver]] on the devel list, how it should be [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/devel/2008-December/003888.html split between kernelspace and userspace], and [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/devel/2009-January/004037.html how to contribute it upstream] to the Linux kernel. I find the mix of high-level technical arguments with social and emotional considerations fascinating.
* It is a pleasure to say that the Community localized the [[Illume keyboard]] to at least [[Illume#List_of_illume_keyboards|nine different languages]]. This does not only involve layout and icon, but also building up a dictionary (the keyboard emits key symbols when in "terminal" mode, but uses predictive dictionary lookups when in "strings" mode.) The frontier: asian languages input.
* The Freeunner is also a target platform for many innovative new input methods.
* Carl proposed a simple in-car mount: stick a piece of velcro on the dashboard, strap the FreeRunner onto it through the hole, flipping the display with ''xrandr -o 2''. Add a standard USB car charger, you are all set.
* GSM firmware updater and hardware buzzfix program: not released yet, still working on it.
* Video driver code was ported from kdrive to xorg architecture, Graeme is now [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/devel/2009-January/003964.html in debugging mode]. Andreas, Chris and Tom are also working on it.
* Miguel's [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOBWSrI14BM video] showcases that the [[Arduino]], a popular open-source electronic prototyping platform, complements well the FreeRunner when it comes to reading sensors and controlling actuators.
* [[Qi]] supports the zImage kernel format.

== Tips and tricks ==

* Booting 2008.12 from a microsd fails with "Only GTA01 hardware supported by ASoc driver" ? Option "ro" on the kernel commandline is fatal for startup of 2008.12. Check your U-Boot env if you're using that for "ro", or try adding rw to /boot/append-GTA02 if you are on SD Card and Qi.
* tangogps 0.9.2 and 0.9.3 have an issue converting between coordinate formats in the western or southern hemispheres.  If you use the DD.dd format it should display the correct value.
* Current FSO should support both the 2.6.24 and 2.6.28 kernels. The patch to use old FSO with new kernel is [http://trac.freesmartphone.org/ticket/293 here].
* Howto [https://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/2192#comment:3 get the wrench and QWERTY] buttons in 2008.12 with the ASU theme.
* Chris Samuel offers a [http://www.csamuel.org/2009/01/08/echo-suppression-fix-for-qt-extended-442-on-openmoko-neo noise reduction+echo suppression patch and binary for QtE 4.4.2].
