Sean's [http://n2.nabble.com/Questions-and-Answers-tp2103754p2103754.html new year interview].

== Distributions ==
* SHR: According to Julien's latest on [http://blog.shr-project.org/ the SHR project blog], the baby is [http://blog.shr-project.org/2009/01/release-time-is-close-whats-left-what-are-we-doing-what-do-we-need.html expected really soon now].

== New applications ==

*Â [[LED clock]] When an Openmoko is sitting unused at night, turn it into an alarm clock with large 7-segment digits on a black background in landscape mode.
* [http://projects.openmoko.org/projects/gprssettings/ GPRSsettings] is a GUI script designed to change apn, login, dialnumber.
* Samuel's script for [http://blog.samuelpereira.net/?p=4 a toggle wifi icon].
* [http://www.opkg.org/package_86.html ylock] 0.1 Python screen lock and low battery monits.
* [http://www.opkg.org/package_85.html AppManager] 1.0.1 Zenity package manager.

== Ports and updates ==
* Lots of [[Navit]] activity. Distributions are kindly suggested to package the sample map separately from the main binary to conserve space.
* The [[opkg]] package manager development [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/opkg-devel/2008-December/000181.html moved from OM svn to Google code]. The recommended stable version is r172, there is a significant data structures+algorithm refactorization going on.
* Version 2.4 of [[orrery]] is now available.   It has a new schematic Solar System View page, showing the position of the planets and our moon in their orbits, a new moon calendar, and a less ugly icon.
* You can now add/remove/edit repositories (i.e. feeds) in [[ZOMG!]] package manager.
* Angus [http://www.mail-archive.com/community@lists.openmoko.org/msg37043.html updated BtGPS.py] to work with FSO. With this script, [[Neo FreeRunner GPS#Bluetooth GPS relay|the FreeRunner works as a bluetooth GPS]].

== Community ==
* Sean's [http://n2.nabble.com/Questions-and-Answers-tp2103754p2103754.html new year interview]
* Rakshat Hooja's company IDA Systems will be at Mumbai's TechFest. There are [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2009-January/039505.html gifts] waiting for the first 10 FreeRunner owners to show up at their boot!
* The [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/devel/2009-January/004064.html Future of location services] thread started as an attempt to clarify the GPS drivers tangle, and then turned to using GSM celltowers and wifi access points location information. Dima [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/devel/2009-January/004074.html signalled that] there are several free databases of GSM tower locations, and that his gta02 Perl script to query [http://www.opencellid.org/ OpenCellID] for the approximate tower location, and then initialize the AGPS with this data works great. There is a database of Wifi access points at [http://wigle.net/ wigle.net].

== Hardware and drivers ==
* Werner [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/hardware/2008-December/000890.html announced] he made an [http://www.almesberger.net/misc/idbg/ internal debug board]. This is contributed as a community member, not as Openmoko employee.
* Filter key bouncing patches.
* There is a thread about the touchscreen driver on the devel list, how it should be [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/devel/2008-December/003888.html split between kernelspace and userspace], and [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/devel/2009-January/004037.html how to contribute it upstream] to the Linux kernel. I find the mix of high-level technical arguments with social and emotional considerations fascinating.
* Illume's keyboard is definitely now The keyboard. It is a pleasure to say that the Community localized it already to at least [[Illume#List_of_illume_keyboards|nine different languages]]. This does not only involves layout and icon, but also building up a dictionary. The frontier: input for asian languages.
* The Freeunner is also a target platform for many innovative new input methods.
* Carl proposed a simple in-car mount: stick a piece of velcro on the dashboard, strap the FreeRunner onto it through the hole, flipping the display with ''xrandr -o 2''. Add a standard USB car charger, you are all set.

== Tips and tricks ==

* Booting 2008.12 from a microsd fails with "Only GTA01 hardware supported by ASoc driver" ? Option "ro" on the kernel commandline is fatal for startup of 2008.12. Check your U-Boot env if you're using that for "ro", or try adding rw to /boot/append-GTA02 if you are on SD Card and Qi.
