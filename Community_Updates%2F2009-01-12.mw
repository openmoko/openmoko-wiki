== New applications ==

*Â [[LED clock]] When an Openmoko is sitting unused at night, turn it into an alarm clock with large 7-segment digits on a black background in landscape mode.
* [http://projects.openmoko.org/projects/gprssettings/ GPRSsettings] is a GUI script designed to change apn, login, dialnumber.

* [http://www.opkg.org/package_85.html AppManager] 1.0.1 Zenity package manager.

== Ports and update ==
* Lots of [[Navit]] activity. Distributions are kindly suggested to package the sample map separately from the main binary to conserve space.
* The [[opkg]] package manager development [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/opkg-devel/2008-December/000181.html moved from OM svn to Google code]. The recommended stable version is r172, there is a significant data structures+algorithm refactorization going on.

== Hardware and drivers ==
* Werner [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/hardware/2008-December/000890.html announced] he made an [http://www.almesberger.net/misc/idbg/ internal debug board]. This is contributed as a community member, not as Openmoko employee.
* Filter key bouncing patches.
* There has been a classic lkml-style discussion on how the touchscreen driver should be split between kernelspace and userspace.

== Tips and tricks ==

* Booting 2008.12 from a microsd fails with "Only GTA01 hardware supported by ASoc driver" ? Option "ro" on the kernel commandline is fatal for startup of 2008.12. Check your U-Boot env if you're using that for "ro", or try adding rw to /boot/append-GTA02 if you are on SD Card and Qi.
