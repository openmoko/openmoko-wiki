To get wireless networking working via the GUI, use the ASU software which includes the campwifi.py script. It will connect to any open (unencrypted) network.

To connect to a WEP encrypted network, you'll need to SSH into your phone and issue the following commands:

<pre>
ifconfig eth0 up                                                                                                    
iwconfig eth0 essid any                                                                                             
iwconfig eth0 key 'mykey'                                                                                           
iwconfig eth0 essid 'myssid'                                                                                        
ifup eth0
</pre>
