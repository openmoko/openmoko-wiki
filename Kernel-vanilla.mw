This page is about vanilla Linux (Linux without any extra patches).

== Functionality ==
This section is about general functionality using vanilla Linux.
* Functionality is the function of the phone
* GTA01 and GTA02 is if the GTA01 or GTA02 has it

* GTA01 and GTA02 is if the GTA01 or GTA02 has that component
* Included is if it now is a part of vanilla Linux. It can have the statuses no, submitted, in staging and yes
* Tested and confirmed to work is if anybody has been able to use the functionality on vanilla Linux

== Building and using a vanilla kernel ==

Before you start you should be warned that if anything goes wrong, say for example that the newest kernel introduce code that makes your phone explode, you your self is responsible for it. First you need the sources to a vanilla kernel that supports you phone. The Freerunner is supported from right before 2.6.32-rc6. You can download it from http://kernel.org/ and unpack it or check it out from git if you want the absolute newest version. To check it out from git go to the command line, navigate to the folder you want to download it to and run:
 git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
Then you need a config. You can find one [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/openmoko-kernel/2009-November/010696.html here]. Replace /path/to/config in the make command with where you stored it.
Now, on the command line, enter the folder where Linux is. To keep the result from the compiling separate from the code create a folder to put it in. I will use GTA02 as the folder name in this example
 mkdir GTA02
If you are using a cross compiler you need to specify its prefix. In this example it is arm-linux-gnueabi- but you could have another. (In arm-linux-gnueabi-cpp arm-linux-gnueabi- is the prefix) If not you should remove the CROSS_COMPILE argument.
Now, run
 cp /path/to/config GTA02/.config
 make O=GTA02 ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- oldconfig
 make O=GTA02 ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi-
After it has compiled do
 arm-linux-gnueabi-objcopy -O binary -R .note -R .comment -S GTA02/arch/arm/boot/compressed/vmlinux GTA02/linux.bin
Then pack it in an image you can Flash to your Freerunner with
 mkimage -A arm -O linux -T kernel -C none -a 30008000 -e 30008000 -n "Freerunner GTA02 vanilla" -d GTA02/linux.bin GTA02/uImage-gta02.bin
You can now [[Flashing_the_Neo_FreeRunner | flash]] it to your phone
