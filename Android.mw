= Introduction = 
This page is the central place for documentation about Android on the [[Neo1973 Hardware|Neo 1973]] and [[Neo_FreeRunner_GTA02_Hardware|FreeRunner]] handsets.

[http://code.google.com/android/ Android] is a software stack for mobile devices developed by the [http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/ The Open Handset Alliance.] Although Android is publicized as being [[open source software]] (most of the source code has been released) parts of the code have not been released yet.

A lot of work is being done to get Android functioning properly on the [[Neo_FreeRunner_GTA02_Hardware|FreeRunner]] and it is likely, in the near future, to be the distribution most suited for using the FreeRunner as a phone.

Inside the FreeRunner 3 software components are working:
* '''bootloader''': a small program that runs first and starts everything else when the FreeRunner is powered on or reset (depending on [[Booting the Neo FreeRunner|how you reset it]], the version from [[NOR_Flash|NOR]] or NAND is booted).
* '''kernel''': the central component in the Linux operating system.
* '''root filesystem''': contains all the files that make up the commands and applications that you can run. 
* Furthermore for the installation you have to format your MircorSD-Card because Android will storedata on it.

= Usage =
See: [[Android usage]] for detailed instructions on using Android on the FreeRunner.

Android is gaining functionality on the FreeRunner all the time and with Michael Trimarchi's [http://panicking.kicks-ass.org/download/ (panicking)] images it is possible to use as an everyday phone. Prerequisites for the best success seem to be:

* Use the jffs version 14.6 and the kernel v17.
* Uboot

You can then hope to achieve :

* GSM calls
* SMS
* Adding, removing and importing contacts
* GPRS
* Wi-Fi

Caveats

* Volume during voice calls is very low.
* Wi-Fi does not reconnect after sleep - [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Android_usage#Wifi setup]
* You have to disable PIN security on your SIM card.

= Installation =

See: [[Android on Freerunner]] for how to flash your FreeRunner with Android.
In addition to flashing your Freerunner for using Android you have to format your SD card with 2 partitions to use Android. Just flashing is not sufficient.
 
<br>You can also install the Koolu beta 4 rc1 directly from SD card onto the NAND see [http://koolu.com/~marcelo/README]

= Development =
See: [[Android porting]]

There are developers being paid to work on the port by [http://koolu.com/ Koolu.]
For details on the project source and some real detailed instructions on building the source, see the [http://trac.koolu.org/ the Koolu Trac Website for Android].<br/>
There is a Android Freerunner Mailing list hosted by Koolu [http://android.koolu.org/listinfo.cgi/android-freerunner-koolu.org]


There is also some great unpaid work going on at [http://panicking.kicks-ass.org/blog/index.php Linux Embedded]
