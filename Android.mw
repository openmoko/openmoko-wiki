= Introduction = 
This page is the central place for documentation about Android on the [[Neo1973 Hardware|Neo 1973]] and [[Neo_FreeRunner_GTA02_Hardware|FreeRunner]] handsets.

[http://code.google.com/android/ Android] is a software stack for mobile devices developed by the [http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/ The Open Handset Alliance.] Although Android is publicized as being [[open source software]] (most of the source code has been released) parts of the code have not been released yet.

A lot of work is being done to get Android functioning properly on the [[FreeRunner]] and it is likely, in the near future, to be the distribution most suited for using the FreeRunner as a phone.

= Usage =
See: [[Android usage]] for detailed instructions on using Android on the FreeRunner.

Android is gaining functionality on the FreeRunner all the time and with Michael Trimarchi's [http://panicking.kicks-ass.org/download/ (panicking)] images it is possible to use as an everyday phone. Prerequisites for the best success seem to be:

* Use the jffs version 14.6 and the kernel v13.
* Uboot (possibly better still, the original version that comes with the FreeRunner)
* The original GSM firmware (moko10 may cause some issues)

You can then hope to achieve :

* GSM calls
* SMS
* Adding, removing and importing contacts
* GPRS
* Wi-Fi

Caveats

* Volume during voice calls is very low.
* Wi-Fi does not reconnect after sleep - [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Android_usage#Wifi setup]
* You have to disable PIN security on your SIM card.
