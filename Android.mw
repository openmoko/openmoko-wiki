= Introduction = 
This page is the central place for documentation about Android on the [[Neo1973 Hardware|Neo 1973]] and [[Neo_FreeRunner_GTA02_Hardware|FreeRunner]] handsets.

[http://code.google.com/android/ Android] is a software stack for mobile devices developed by the [http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/ The Open Handset Alliance.] Although Android is publicised as being open source software (most of the source code has been released) parts of the code have not been released yet, namely the GSM library. This makes porting Android to the OpenMoko phones difficult. However, there are promises that the remaining parts of the code will be released.

A lot of work is being done to get Android functioning properly on the FreeRunner and it is likely, in the near future, to be the distribution closest to making the FreeRunner function as an everyday phone.
