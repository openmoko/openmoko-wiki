= Introduction =

This page is dedicated to porting the [http://www.android.com Android OS] to the [[Neo 1973]] and [[Neo FreeRunner]] handsets. Since the Android OS was [http://source.android.com/posts/opensource  publically released] on 20081021, [http://benno.id.au/blog/2007/11/21/android-neo1973 work] [http://perpetual-notion.blogspot.com/search/label/android is] [http://groups.google.com/group/android-porting currently underway] to port Android to the [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Neo1973_Hardware Neo 1973] and [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Neo_FreeRunner_GTA02_Hardware FreeRunner] handsets.


== Early Attempts ==

As [http://benno.id.au Ben Leslie] had pointed out on his [http://benno.id.au/blog/2007/11/21/android-neo1973 blog] far before the source code was released, [http://www.android.com Android] was originally designed to work with the ARMv5TE [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture instruction set architecture] (ISA), which allows for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture#DSP_Enhancement_Instructions DSP enhanced instructions]. Contrary to the ARMv5TE ISA, the Neo1973 and FreeRunner handsets both feature an arm920t core, which comply to the ARMv4T ISA.

Before the source code was released, kernel trap handlers were implemented to 'emulate' the ARMv5TE ISA. Although the results worked in many cases, trapping is costly and performance suffered as a result. Moreover, without explicitly knowing which conditions were set by various instructions, such as Thumb Mode execution, the result became nondeterministic.

== Current State ==

With the release of the Android [http://source.android.com source code], the Open Source community is no longer limited to dealing with a binary-only product. The Open Handset Alliance (OHA) has let their source code become their product for everyone enrich to benefit from.

Currently, porting efforts are underway in many circles. Patches should be submitted via the [http://source.android.com/submit-patches official Android channels].

= How to Help =

== Getting Started ==

You can start by following the instructions to download and build the Android source from scratch. Please see [http://source.android.com/download http://source.android.com/download] and follow the instructions for your architecture.

== Publicize Your Efforts ==

It's generally a good idea to make your efforts known via wiki systems, public mailing lists, forums, and publically open version control systems. 

Always take credit for your work but please don't do it in the form of comments. Some code is already hard enough to read without comments polluting the text. The best thing to do is to create a patch and put a header with your information at the top. Collaboration systems such as git might already do this for you (??).

If you create something new and have the ability to designate the license for it, please consider license compatibility issues.

== Porting Strategy ==

* Analysis and leverage of the existing build system
** buid/core/combo/arm-linux.mk
*** -D__ARCH_ARM_4__ -D__ARCH_ARM_4T__
*** -march=armv4t -mcpu=arm920t
** fix various static references to 'armv5'
* Isolating ARMv5TE ISA dependent code
** e.g. grep -n -R -i "${armv5te_isa_pattern}" ~/android
* Abstracting
** ( C/C++ ) Use inlined functions / #ifdef statments to implement functions in a portable manner
** ( ASM ) #ifdef statements ?

For each ARMv5TE instruction, one could potentially
* Implement the instruction using general registers instead of DSP calls (i.e. eabi / softfloat)
* If that is a) nondeterministic, or b) slow, then sections of code need to be analyzed and hand-optimized for the ARMv4T isa

== Updates ==

Feel free to post a link to any of your work in the list below

* 20081021 [[User:Cfriedt]] Android -> FreeRunner updates on my [http://perpetual-notion.blogspot.com/search/label/android blog]
* 20081022 [[User:Cfriedt]] I was able to 'trivially' compile all of the Android source code without error for the ARMv4T architecture by removing v5TE instructions. Although it will definitely not run anything predictably, at least now that I know the build system will work with a few simple substitutions in build/core/combo/arm-linux.mk. At this point I am able to go ahead and re-implement v5TE instructions as v4T instruction sequences instead (or re-implement entire sections of assembly with hand-optimized v4T instructions).
