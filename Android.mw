= Introduction = 
This page is the central place for documentation about Android on the [[Neo1973 Hardware|Neo 1973]] and [[Neo_FreeRunner_GTA02_Hardware|FreeRunner]] handsets.

[http://code.google.com/android/ Android] is a software stack for mobile devices developed by the [http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/ The Open Handset Alliance.] Although Android is publicised as being open source software (most of the source code has been released) parts of the code have not been released yet.

A lot of work is being done to get Android functioning properly on the FreeRunner and it is likely, in the near future, to be the distribution closest to enabling the FreeRunner to function as an everyday phone.

= Usage =
See: [[Android usage]] for detailed instructions on using Android on the FreeRunner.

Android is gaining functionality on the FreeRunner all the time and with Michael Trimarchi's [http://panicking.kicks-ass.org/download/ (panicking)] images it is just possible to use as an everyday phone. Prerequisites for the best success seem to be:

* Uboot (possibly better still, the original version that comes with the FreeRunner)
* The original GSM firmware (moko10 may cause some issues)

You can then hope to achive:

* GSM calls
* SMS
* Adding, removing and importing contacts

Caveats

* When the phone is asleep you will not get notified of new sms messages (although you will receive them).
* You can not manually lock the phone, only wait for the time out.
* Due to the placement of the on-screen keyboard you can not see what your typing in an sms.
* Volume during voice calls is very low.
