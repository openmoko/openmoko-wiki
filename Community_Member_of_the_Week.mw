=Purpose=

Michael Shiloh proposed in a [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-March/014580.html mail] to make a poll for the Openmoko "Community Member of the Week".

"The intent is clearly to identify and appreciate those of you who have 
made and continue to make substantial contributions, and also to 
encourage that extra bit of work required to turn a good application 
into an excellent one, with a nicely polished GUI, a well written user 
guide, etc."

I'm not sure, how the voting should be handled. However, I want to start with a nomination.

| [[User:Kevin_Dean|Kevin]]
| Kevin writes the (almost) daily [[Snapshot_review|Snapshot review]] and reports on the progress and problems of the current software. Since I'm not an owner of a GTA01, I can't test the software by myself. Therefore any information about Openmoko makes the waiting for the Freerunner less bitter.  I'm reading the different mailing lists very carefully and come to know of solved bugs and new features. However, Kevin gives with his reviews an impression of the software from a users point of view. And when the Freerunner is released, I hope Kevin will continue with his reviews so I always know what snapshot is safe to use.

| Josch has done the really cool hack of getting a full [[debian]] installation, complete with XOrg and touch screen support, up and running on a Neo 1973.

| [[User:ScaredyCat|ScaredyCat]]
| ScaredyCat generates his own daily images and publishes them. In these images he "plays around" with alternatives such as the GTK theme. This provides some insight into technical alternatives that can improve Openmoko. He's also quite willing to check for the existance and repeatability of bugs and is constantly active on IRC.

If you run out of votes in any week, you could look at [[Community_nominees_for_GTA02_P0]] for ideas ...
