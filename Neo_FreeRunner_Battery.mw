* 1700mAh Battery
** There is some confusion in the community at the moment about the final size of the battery for the Neo FreeRunner
*** This page suggests 1700mAh
*** Other pages which have been recently edited by [[mickeyl]] and others suggest 1200mAh http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Neo1973:_GTA01Bv4_versus_GTA02_comparison
*** The prototypes pages also suggest that current FreeRunner prototypes are using 1200mAH batteries http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Prototypes
** I guess we just have to wait and see what is announced
