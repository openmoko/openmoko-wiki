*The Smart Battery keeps track of maximum and current capacity for precise prediction of remaining battery power and time until shutdown, based on actual power dissipation.

** Other pages which have been recently edited by [[mickeyl]] and others suggest 1200mAh ([[Neo1973: GTA01Bv4 versus GTA02 comparison]])

==== Notes about expected battery life ====
Battery life is a work in progress. The power saving software is in a very rudimentary state. At the moment 12h is about the most (note though a [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-July/020339.html recent result of at least 21h], mostly in suspend, with multiple short wakeups, on the predecessor device GTA01). A week standby and 6 hours talk, 20 hours mp3 might be attainable when power saving software is complete.
