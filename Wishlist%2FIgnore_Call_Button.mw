== Ignore-call button ==

An incoming call could be ignored, just pressing(touching?) a button when the phone is ringing. The GSM call is active, but you can use the apps in phone normaly.

Maybe an icon in the top panel area that allow you to pick up the call.

== Design Issues ==

When there is an active GSM call, you can't make a new one.
