== Ignore-call button ==

An incoming call could be ignored, just pressing(touching?) a button when the phone is ringing. The GSM call is active, but you can use the apps in phone normaly.

Maybe an icon in the top panel area that allow you to pick up the call.

== Design Issues ==

When there is an active GSM call, you can't make a new one.
* Current GSM terminals all support (at least) 3-party conference, including calling and then adding the 3rd party to the conference yourself. Some (GSM) providers offer it as an optional service, but it '''is''' in the standard and I'm almost sure Calypso knows about it and can handle it just fine. We should make provisions for/allow for that case to exist as it is a current usage pattern. --[[User:Csdexter|@Dexter]] 09:54, 22 February 2007 (CET)
