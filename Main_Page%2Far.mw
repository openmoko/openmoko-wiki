[[OpenMoko]] is an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source Open Source] project to create the world's first free mobile phone operating system.

The [[OpenMoko]] project is a community that anyone can join, to help design their ideal phone.

The long term goal is that phone software won't be tied to any particular phone. You can install any OpenMoko software over the whole range of phones, and if you upgrade your phone, you don't lose the software. Bugs fixed on one phone are fixed on all. To show that OpenMoko the phone stack is not tied to the Neo1973 phone hardware, here is a report from somebody who seems to have OpenMoko [http://blog.mikeasoft.com/2007/07/01/openmoko-on-a-treo-650/ up and limping on the Palm Treo650]!

'''Currently it is not suitable for users.''' The state of the software at the moment is pre-alpha. If you order a Neo1973, DO NOT expect to be able to use it as an everyday phone for several months.

The [[Neo1973]] from [[FIC]] is the first of many phones that [[OpenMoko]] will run on; indeed, some people erroneously use the terms Neo1973 and OpenMoko as interchangeable. If you are willing to have the alpha test experience, you can order Neo1973 hardware now from the [https://direct.openmoko.com/ Openmoko Online Shop].

Please join us in collaborating on the [[OpenMoko]] project through any of the [[Development resources | project resources]] including this OpenMoko wiki. Please see the [[Help:Contents | wiki editing help page]] for information on making contributions to this wiki. A [[Meet the Core Team | core team of developers funded by FIC, Inc.]] leads the project.

An [[introduction]] page is available, with [[Introduction#Photos|photos]] and [[Introduction#Videos|videos]].  Moreover, the usual [[FAQ | Frequently Asked Questions, FAQ, page]] might be helpful. Developers may find the [[ChangeLog | daily software change log]] an important resource.

The members of the [[OpenMoko]] community would like to thank [[FIC|FIC Inc.]] for showing leadership and initiating the [[OpenMoko]] project.
