I'm kind of a noob to this whole programing thing so correct or delete this page if this is like impossible,

the idea is to create virtual buttons on the phone when plugged into a computer so the phone can be used as a joystick or a volume control slider


== Different types that might be made ==
- a joystick with a d-pad/ 2-4  buttons or something where one can put the keys any where see http://www.thinkgeek.com/computing/input/77ba/

- a few hot keys with the ability to launch other programs ect. see http://www.thinkgeek.com/computing/input/88ee/

- use the accelerometer (if included) as an input device such as the wiimote with glovepie

- a slider to easily control volume ect.?
==GUI==
Before plugged in to computer the user could open the program and then choose which input device to use
== Pros ==
- customizable hot keys could be used to input non-English type such as รถ or ร ect.

== Cons/concerns==
