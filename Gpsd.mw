== What is GPS ==

The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a worldwide radio-navigation system formed from a constellation of 24 satellites and their ground stations. 

GPS uses these "man-made stars" as reference points to calculate positions accurate to a matter of meters. In fact, with advanced forms of GPS you can make measurements to better than a centimeter! 

In a sense it's like giving every square meter on the planet a unique address. 

GPS receivers have been miniaturized to just a few integrated circuits and so are becoming very economical. And that makes the technology accessible to virtually everyone. 

These days GPS is finding its way into cars, boats, planes, construction equipment, movie making gear, farm machinery, even laptop computers. 

Soon GPS will become almost as basic as the telephone. Indeed, at Trimble, we think it just may become a universal utility.

== PMB 2520 Hammerhead ==
The PMB 2520 Hammerhead is a IC sulution for GPS that producted by the Infineon Technologies. It allows the usage of assistance data by surpporting A-GPS standards.

=== Modules of the Hammerhead ===

The Hammerhead consists of the following modules:
*RF front-end with on-chip, high gain and low noise, LNA, I/Q mixers, on-chip polyphase complex IF filter, digitally controlled AGC, and 3-bits ADC for the I and Q paths.
*Sigma-Delta RF PLL with on-chip PCO and on-chip loop filter.
*Embedded PLL and NCO for baseband clock generation.
*Multiple channels digital mixers and parallel correlator engines to enable real time correlation of the PRN code for up to 14 satellites.
*Post processor including peak detection logic
*SRAM for storing correlation results

=== Host Interface ===

The Hammerhead integrates 3 serial interfaces:
*UART
*I2C
*SPI

The UART in the Hammerhead is a full-duplex UART interface. It is fixed in 8N1(8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit) mode. On the GTA01, the host processor connect with the Hammerhead through the UART.

=== Host software Architecture ===

The Hammerhead driver software is delivered as a library. The library has two seperate interfaces for the software. One part of them provides an interface to communicate with the high level software. The other part is the HAL(Hardware Abstraction Layer), it is used to communicate with the system.

The library provides the following infomations to the high level software:
*Position data
*Library status
The high level software sends the following messages to the library:
*Assistance data
*Positioning Commands
*Configuration Commands
*Time-out and Packet Available

The library communicates with the system at the following part:
*Communications Drivers
*System Timer
*NV storage
*Log buffer

== GPS on GTA01 ==

At the GTA01, the host processor is a SC2410..

=== Hammerhead on the GTA01 ===

On the GTA01, the Hammerhead are configured that connected with the host processor through the UART. The UART of data output/input is connected to the UART 1 of the SC2410. The UART of the hardware flow control is connected to the UART 2 of the SC2410.
