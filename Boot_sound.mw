= The Boot Sound (in OM2007.2) =

Annoying isn't it. To stop the boot sound playing simply edit '''/etc/pulse/session'''. Look near the bottom of the file, you should see something like:

 # Load samples
 load-sample startup /usr/share/openmoko/sounds/startup_openmoko.wav
 load-sample touchscreen /usr/share/openmoko/sounds/touchscreen_click.wav


To disable the boot sound and/or the touchscreen tap sound simply place a # at the start of the line, ie:


 # Load samples
 #load-sample startup /usr/share/openmoko/sounds/startup_openmoko.wav
 #load-sample touchscreen /usr/share/openmoko/sounds/touchscreen_click.wav


If you want to change the sound, simply change the .wav file name to something else.
