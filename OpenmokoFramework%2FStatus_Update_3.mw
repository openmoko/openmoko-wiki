Hi guys! This is the third Openmoko Framework Team Status update, featuring our second milestone release, and more.

== What happened since the last report ==

=== People ===

* John Lee <john_lee@openmoko.com> joined the framework team and will help us part time -- welcome on board, John!

=== DBus APIs ===

* org.freesmartphone.GSM is almost complete now and stable. We did only minor corrections and enhancements based on client feedback.
* Preliminary versions of org.freesmartphone.Device.Audio and .Accelerometer have been added.
* org.freedesktop.Gypsy has been enhanced to serve the need of advanced GPS device control.
* Still brainstorming about org.freesmartphone.Preferences and org.freesmartphone.Context.

=== Implementations ===

'''Openmoko Framework Image -- 'All good things' (Milestone II)'''

This is the second milestone release of the framework and the framework testing application 'Zhone'.
