{{Languages|Bootloader commands}}

Various tasks are performed with bootloader commands. On the [[bootloader]] console, you can list the available commands with "help", and get more information about each command with "help command".

== Auto-boot ==

Auto-boot executes the command[s] specified in the ''bootcmd'' environment variable. The default configuration is:
<pre>
GTA01Bv3 # printenv
bootcmd=setenv bootargs ${bootargs_base} ${mtdparts}; nand read.e 0x32000000 kernel; bootm 0x32000000
</pre>

This basically tells us that it will load the content of the NAND [[Partitions|partition]] '''kernel''' to memory address 0x32000000 and then try to boot it.

== Environment ==

:''See also [[bootloader environment]].''

u-boot is configured to manage a non-volatile environment that is stored in the NAND flash [[Partitions|partition]] named "u-boot_env".  u-boot itself gets the location from OOB. You have commands to display, alter, and store the environment.

This displays all definitions in the current environment:
<pre>
GTA01Bv2 # printenv
baudrate=115200
bootargs=rootfstype=jffs2 root=/dev/mtdblock4 console=ttySAC0,115200 console=tty0 loglevel=8 dyntick=enable lpj=252416
usbtty=cdc_acm
bootdelay=10
stdout=serial
stderr=serial
stdin=serial
mtdparts=mtdparts=neo1973-nand:0x00030000(u-boot),0x0000c000(u-boot_env),0x00200000(kernel),0x00130000(splash),0x03c94000(rootfs)
mtdids=nand0=neo1973-nand
bootargs_base=rootfstype=jffs2 root=/dev/mtdblock4 console=ttySAC0,115200 console=tty0 loglevel=8 dyntick=enable lpj=252416
bootcmd=setenv bootargs ${bootargs_base} ${mtdparts}; nand read.e 0x32000000 kernel; bootm 0x32000000
pcf50606_int1=0x40
filesize=160C000
partition=nand0,0
mtddevnum=0
mtddevname=u-boot
Environment size: 670/16380 bytes
GTA01Bv2 #
</pre>

The following example shows how to manipulate an individual definition, and store the updated environment in flash:
<pre>
GTA01Bv3 # setenv bootdelay 10
GTA01Bv3 # printenv bootdelay
bootdelay=10
GTA01Bv3 # saveenv
Saving Environment to NAND...
Erasing Nand...Writing to Nand... done
GTA01Bv3 #
</pre>

Note: When setting multiple commands, e.g. for bootcmd, you need to escape the ';', for instance:

<pre>
GTA01Bv3 # setenv bootcmd mmcinit\; ext2load mmc 0 0x32000000 uImage\; bootm 0x32000000
</pre>

== MMC/SD ==

in order to initialize a MMC/SD card, you have to use the ``mmcinit'' command.
<pre>
GTA01Bv3 # mmcinit
trying to detect SD Card...
MMC found. Card desciption is:
Manufacturer ID = 58d564
HW/FW Revision = 3 8
Product Name = 21DN!@X�
Serial Number = 445303
Month = 5
Year = 2000
READ_BL_LEN=15, C_SIZE_MULT=7, C_SIZE=3197
size = 4208984064
GTA01Bv3 #
</pre>

afterwards, you can read ext2 filesystems like:
<pre>
GTA01Bv3 # ext2ls mmc 0
<DIR>       1024 .
<DIR>       1024 ..
<DIR>      12288 lost+found
1544788 uImage
</pre>

== NAND ==

<pre>
GTA01Bv3 # help nand
nand info                  - show available NAND devices
nand device [dev]     - show or set current device
nand read[.jffs2]     - addr off size
nand write[.jffs2]    - addr off size - read/write `size' bytes starting
at offset `off' to/from memory address `addr'
nand erase [clean] [off size] - erase `size' bytes from
offset `off' (entire device if not specified)
nand bad - show bad blocks
nand dump[.oob] off - dump page
nand scrub - really clean NAND erasing bad blocks (UNSAFE)
nand markbad off - mark bad block at offset (UNSAFE)
nand biterr off - make a bit error at offset (UNSAFE)
</pre>

=== Loading Kernel from NAND ===

<pre>
GTA01Bv3 # nand read 0x32000000 kernel

NAND read: device 0 offset 212992, size 2097152 ...  2097152 bytes read: OK

</pre>

=== Writing new bootloader to NAND ===

The following set of commands loads the file u-boot.bin from ext2/mmc and flashes it into the
bootloader flash [[Partitions|partition]]:

<pre>
GTA01Bv3 # ext2load mmc 0 0x32000000 u-boot.bin
GTA01Bv3 # nand erase u-boot
GTA01Bv3 # nand write.e 0x32000000 u-boot ${filesize}
</pre>

=== Writing kernel to NAND ===

The following set of commands loads the file uImage from ext2/mmc and flashes it into the
kernel flash [[Partitions|partition]]:

<pre>
GTA01Bv3 # ext2load mmc 0 0x32000000 uImage
GTA01Bv3 # nand erase kernel
GTA01Bv3 # nand write.e 0x32000000 kernel ${filesize}
</pre>

=== Writing rootfs to NAND ===

The following set of commands loads the file rootfs.jffs2 from ext2/mmc and flashes it into the
rootfs flash [[Partitions|partition]]:

<pre>
GTA01Bv3 # ext2load mmc 0 0x32000000 rootfs.jffs2
GTA01Bv3 # nand erase rootfs
GTA01Bv3 # nand write.e 0x32000000 rootfs ${filesize}
</pre>

Please note that this will only work with root file system sizes that are smaller than the amount of memory above 0x32000000, which in the case of 64MB SDRAM is something like 32MB. '''Warning''': you risk bricking your phone if you attempt to read in too large a file as extload appears to write the overflow into dangerous parts of memory address space.

== Neo1973 specific commands ==

Our version of u-boot supports a couple of Neo1973 specific commands:
<pre>
GTA01Bv4 # help neo1973
neo1973 neo1973 info - display phone information
neo1973 power-off - switch off the phone
neo1973 charger status - display charger status
neo1973 charger autofast - enable automatic fast (500mA) charging
neo1973 charger !autofast - disable automatic fast (500mA) charging
neo1973 charger fast - enable fast (500mA) charging
neo1973 charger off - disable charging
neo1973 backlight (on|off) - switch backlight on or off
neo1973 led num (on|off) - switch LED number 'num' on or off
neo1973 vibrator (on|off) - switch vibrator on or off
neo1973 gsm (on|off|version) - switch GSM Modem on/off or print firmware version
neo1973 gps (on|off) - switch GPS system on or off
neo1973 udc pullup (on|off) - switch USB device controller pull-up on or off
</pre>

=== Info ===

Using
GTA01Bv4 # neo1973 info
FIC Neo1973 Hardware Revision 0x0240
GTA01Bv4 #

you can display hardware reference and revision

=== Power-off ===

Using
neo1973 power-off

you can switch the device off from the bootloader prompt.

=== Battery charger related ===

For a detailed description of the charger basics, see [[Neo1973 Battery Charger]].

==== Inquiring the charger state ====

You can get the current charger status by issuing
neo1973 charger status

The following modes are possible:

* idle - no charging
* trickle - FIXME
* pre - Slow (100mA) charging, works in hardware.
* fast_cccv - Fast (500mA) charging, using Constant-Current followed by Constant Voltage (Li-Ion)

==== Disabling battery charging ====

You can disable battery charging (until the next reboot) by issuing
neo1973 charger off

==== Forcing fast charge ====

Using
neo1973 charger fast
you can force the PMU to try to do a fast (500mA) charge of the battery. It will abort if the battery is in over temperature or some other error condition occurs.

The following commands will add a boot menu entry that switches to fast charging and turns off the backlight:
 setenv menu_6 Fast-Charge and Backlight Off: neo1973 charger fast\; neo1973 backlight off
 saveenv

While in this state, your Neo1973 can be charged with a generic USB charger. You also need to set
 setenv boot_menu_timeout 65000
 saveenv
to keep it from powering down, though.

==== Enabling / Disabling automatic fast charge ====

Autofast is a feature of the PCF50606 PMU.  It means that the fast_cccv mode will be automatically selected if a charger with suitable voltage is plugged in, and the battery not in over temperature condition.

{{warning|This is potentially dangerous.  Only enable autofast if you ARE SURE that you can draw 500mA from the USB connector.  This is the case with a wall outlet charger, or if you are attached to a self-powered hub or a desktop PC root hub.  Bus powered hubs and some laptops only provide 100mA on their USB ports and can thus not support fast charging}}

You can enable or disable autofast by
neo1973 charger autofast
and
neo1973 charger !autofast
respectively.

=== Backlight ===

You can switch the backlight on and off by using
neo1973 backlight on
and
neo1973 backlight off
respectively.

=== Vibrator ===

You can switch the vibrator on and off by using
neo1973 vibrator on
and
neo1973 vibrator off
respectively.


=== GSM ===

Starting with Openmoko patchset '''SVN revision 2885''', u-boot contains support for powering the GSM modem,
and even accessing the modem from the console.

==== GSM power ====

You can switch the GSM modem on and off by using
neo1973 gsm on
and
neo1973 gsm off
respectively.

==== terminal mode ====

You can access the GSM modem using openmoko's built-in terminal emulator in u-boot.

The following example demonstrates how:

<pre>
GTA01Bv4 # neo1973 gsm on
GTA01Bv4 # terminal serial
switching s3ser0 from console into GSM mode
Entering terminal mode for port serial
Use '~.' to leave the terminal and get back to u-boot
ATE1
OK
AT+CGMI?
ERROR
AT+CGMI
FIC

OK
AT+CGMR
GTA01Bv4

OK
~[u-boot]~.
switched s3ser0 from GSM mode back into console mode
GTA01Bv4 # neo1973 gsm off
GTA01Bv4 #
</pre>

{{note|If you're using the ''cu'' terminal emulator on your host PC to access u-boot, you have
to press '~' twice in order to escape it and make sure it actually gets sent to the Neo!}}

== S3C2410 specific commands ==

<pre>
GTA01Bv2 # help s3c2410
s3c2410 speed get - display current PLL speed config
s3c2410 speed list - display supporte PLL speed configs
s3c2410 speed set - set PLL speed
GTA01Bv2 # s3c2410 speed list
50 MHz
101 MHz
202 MHz
266 MHz
GTA01Bv2 # s3c2410 speed get
FCLK = 202 MHz, HCLK = 101 MHz, PCLK = 50 MHz
GTA01Bv2 # s3c2410 speed set 101
GTA01Bv2 # s3c2410 speed get
FCLK = 101 MHz, HCLK = 50 MHz, PCLK = 50 MHz
</pre>

=== 266MHz clock ===

You can re-configure the [[S3C2410]] PLL to generate a 266 MHz core cpu clock (rather than the 200MHz default) by using
GTA01Bv2 # s3c2410 speed set 266
and
GTA01Bv2 # s3c2410 speed set 202
respectively.

{{warning|The old hardware (Phase 0 - GTA01Bv3) only runs stable at 266MHz if you do not attach anything (esp. the FPC / [[Debug Board]] to the Debug Port}}

{{note|New U-Boot (at least the svn3817 I use at now) use a new command 'S3C24xx', I assume for consistency when using GTA02}}

== TFTP on QT2410 ==

The QT2410 cs8900a Ethernet can be used to download images via network.

First, you have to make sure that ''ipaddr'', ''serverip'', ''ethaddr'' and ''netmask'' are set correctly in the environment:

<pre>
QT2410 # printenv
ethaddr=00:01:02:03:04:05
netmask=255.255.255.0
ipaddr=192.168.100.100
serverip=192.168.100.1
</pre>


=== TFTP kernel download ===

<pre>
QT2410 # tftpboot 0x32000000
*** Warning: no boot file name; using 'C0A86464.img'
TFTP from server 192.168.100.1; our IP address is 192.168.100.100
Filename 'C0A86464.img'.
Load address: 0x32000000
Loading: #################################################################
#################################################################
#################################################################
#################################################################
##########################################
done
Bytes transferred = 1544788 (179254 hex)
</pre>

you can then commence booting via
<pre>
QT2410# bootm 0x32000000
</pre>
