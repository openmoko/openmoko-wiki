== 目前狀態 ==
2008年的十月三日，Trolltech公司釋出了針對Openmoko Neo FreeRunner使用的，包含Qtopia 4.4.1版本的 [http://qtextended.org/modules/mydownloads/visit.php?lid=86 Qtopia ROM flash image containing the rootfs]。這個版本可以為 [http://qtextended.org/modules/mydownloads/visit.php?lid=91 mwebster 含了kernel的ROM flash image]。

這個映像檔可以成功的發送及接收通話及文字訊息。它可以讀取sim卡上的所有通訊錄(它更新了2007.2 無法顯示通訊錄的功能)。 它包含了較2007.2 映像檔中更為穩定的映應用程式。它擁有更為成熟的多重輸入的方法。但它並沒有web瀏覽器或者是GPS 應用程式。 但你可以使用協力廠商的 GPS 應用程式：

* [http://www.linux4.be/fr/roadmap.html RoadMap(experimental) here]

在2008年的9月2日，Trolltech也釋出了4.3.3-snapshot，它修正了一些問題 (sms 訊息無法在重新開始後接收訊息，Qtopia 會在接收二通電話間處生問題、預設的通話音量及麥克風輸出；迴音修正)。You can find all the Qtopia images [http://qtextended.org/modules/mydownloads/viewcat.php?cid=6 here] (including Qtextended/Qtopia 4.4 for FreeRunner and Neo1973!)

== Option 1: 將 Qtopia 燒錄到 FreeRunner ==

下載之前提到的映像檔，並且依照下面的操作方法進行：
[[Flashing the Neo FreeRunner]]

== Option 2: Dual-Booting between Qtopia and 2007.2 (Qtopia boots from MicroSD card) ==

Installation Requirements:

# SSH shell access to 2007.2 based image of the FreeRunner through USB interface or WLAN.
# A Desktop Linux distro (to unpack the .jffs2 image, I ran Ubuntu under VMWare)


=== Preparing the SD card ===

See the [[Booting from SD#Prepare the SD card| Preparing the SD Card]] section of the [[Booting from SD]] page for partitioning and formatting instructions.  After you complete the "Formatting the SD Card" steps, return here and execute the following:

mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /media/card
mkdir /media/card/boot

mkdir /media/mmcblk0p2
mount /dev/mmcblk0p2 /media/mmcblk0p2

This will set you up properly for the installation of the root filesystem and the kernel in the steps below.

=== Installing Qtopia ===

==== Unpacking the Qtopia Root Filesystem Image ====

Download the Qtopia FLASH image from [[Latest Images#Qtopia images]] to your Linux box and extract its contents:

tar xzf qtopia-4.3.2-gta02-flash-*.tgz

You should now have two files:
#uImage-2.6.24+git18+9c058ff0d2641df3c36fc3300acb72078d2c41d4-r0-om-gta02.bin
#qtopia-4.3.2-gta02-rootfs-07172049.jffs2
Now, mount the root file system from the jffs2 using the commands found [[Userspace root image#Mounting the JFFS2 image on a loop back device (Block Memory MTD Emulation) |here]].  However, in the mount command, substitute the image filename for "/dev/mtdblock0".

==== Creating a compressed tarball ====

Next, tar up the root filesystem:

# tar czf qtopia-4.3.2-gta02-rootfs-07172049.tar.gz -C <mountpoint> .

Where ''<mountpoint>'' is the location where the jff2 filesystem was mounted.  Note the space and the period after the mountpoint.

==== Installing Root Filesystem ====

Transfer this compressed tarball to the second partition of the MicroSD that is mounted on the FreeRunner:

scp qtopia-4.3.2-gta02-rootfs-07172049.tar.gz root@192.168.0.202:/media/mmcblk0p2/

Log in to your FreeRunner and unpack the root filesystem:

cd /media/mmcblk0p2
tar xzf qtopia-4.3.2-gta02-rootfs-07172049.tar.gz
rm qtopia-4.3.2-gta02-rootfs-07172049.tar.gz
rm -f /media/mmcblk0p2/boot/*

'''''Note:''''' the last step removes the kernel image from the second partition.  For some reason, U-Boot cannot find the uImage.bin file in the first partition if a kernel image exists in the second partition boot/ directory.

==== Installing Kernel ====

From your Linux box, rename <tt>uImage-2.6.24+git18+9c058ff0d2641df3c36fc3300acb72078d2c41d4-r0-om-gta02.bin</tt> to <tt>uImage.bin</tt> and copy it to the boot directory on the first partition of the MicroSD card.  Depending on the version of U-Boot you have installed, this may not work.  To prevent any possible issues, copy it to the <tt>/media/card</tt> directory as well. There is plenty of room on the first partition to have <tt>uImage.bin</tt> in both locations.

mv uImage-2.6.24+git18+9c058ff0d2641df3c36fc3300acb72078d2c41d4-r0-om-gta02.bin uImage.bin
scp uImage.bin root@192.168.0.202:/media/card/boot/
scp uImage.bin root@192.168.0.202:/media/card/

==== Pointing Qtopia to the SD Card ====

Lorn Potter on the mailing lists pointed this out:

Qtopia was designed to be run from the root partition on a flash chip, not from a removable sd card.

You would have to edit the etc/default/Trolltech/Storage.conf file to make it forget about the sd /dev node, to be able to run it this way"

Another user's solution to this is the following:

Edit this file:     " /opt/Qtopia/etc/default/Trolltech/Storage.conf
And change the [MountPoint0] section so it resembles this:
-[
[MountPoint0]
Name[] = SD Card
Path=/dev/mmcblk0p1
Removable = 0
Applications = 0
Documents = 0
ContentDatabase = 0

== Option 3: updating from source ==

{{note|This will upgrade only opt/Qtopia directory, you should use opkg update/upgrade for the rest}}
Original Qtopia images (the distribution released by Trolltech, not ASU) are rarely released as a rootfs image, but the source code is often updated. If you want to reflash your OM with the latest version of Qtopia you might build it from sources. This has been explained in [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-August/024785.html this thread] of the community mailing list. Summing up:

* get the latest toolchain released by trolltech: http://www.qtopia.net/modules/mydownloads/singlefile.php?lid=38 and unzip it on your PC (as root)
cd /
wget http://qtopia.net/downloads/neo/arm920t-eabi-ficgta01-toolchain.tgz
tar xvzf arm920t-eabi-ficgta01-toolchain.tgz
* get the latest snapshot from trolltech: ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/qtopia/snapshots/
*  once dowloaded untar it
tar xvzf qtopia-opensource-src-4.3.2-snapshot-20080806.tar.gz
* make a "build" dir
mkdir build
cd build
* configure and make:
../qtopia-opensource-src-4.3.2-snapshot-20080806/configure -device ficgta01
make
This will take some time (couple hours). Note that the option "-device ficgta01" should work for both neo and freerunner. Then:

make install

will make a root directory into the ''build'' directory. There you can find an ''image'' that directory should be copied to /opt/Qtopia of your phone with scp. once done restart qpe or whole phone.

== Booting into Qtopia ==

Now shutdown the FreeRunner

shutdown -h now

Log into U-Boot in the NAND Flash to boot from the MicroSD card: (instructions from [[Booting the Neo FreeRunner]])

* Press and hold Power button
* Then while still pressing the Power button, press and hold AUX button for 5 to 8 seconds.
* A boot menu will appear.
* Press the AUX button to select "[[Boot from sd card|Boot from MicroSD]]" and then press the Power button to execute.

Qtopia should now boot.

'''''Note:''''' you may get a kernel panic which says that "optional features not supported".  If this is the case, boot back into 2007.2 and run

umount /dev/mmcblk0p2
fsck.ext3.e2fsprogs /dev/mmcblk0p2

This will clean up the file system and clear recovery flags in ext3 that ext2 does not support, then try booting from the MicroSD again.

== Internationalization ==

Qtopia comes with support for German and American English, and users from other countries will find that Qtopia's predictive keyboard makes writing in another language near impossible. One way to disable the predictive keyboard is to simply replace /opt/Qtopia/etc/dict/en_US/common.dawg and words.dawg with empty files (after backing them up). Qtopia normally looks in these files for words to suggest, and if it doesn't find any words that fit, it simply shows what you actually wrote.

Adding characters to the keyboard requires modifications to the source code, as described [http://www.qtopia.net/modules/newbb_plus/viewtopic.php?topic_id=512&forum=16 here].



== Suspend /Resume ==
It seems that suspend/resume only works when the FreeRunner has been connected to a powersource (only a few seconds if sufficient). If you boot from battery, it will never suspend until you have plugged it in at least for a couple of seconds.

== Bugs ==

See [http://trolltech.org/developer/task-tracker/index_html?method=front Trolltech's tracker] ([http://trolltech.org/developer/task-tracker/index_html?method=advsearch&searchstr=&bugs=on&sugs=on&product=2&functionalarea=&versionfound=&versionfixed=&priority=-1&status=0&resolution=-1 Qtopia Tracker]).

Bug reports should be sent to qt-bugs@trolltech.com or by web form at http://trolltech.com/bugreport-form.

== Bugs in 4.4.1 ==
* Boot and Shutdown Splash will not work because splash-write was not compiled into Busybox
* Timezone & time on latest Qt 4.4.1
* The first item in a list is missing the top half
