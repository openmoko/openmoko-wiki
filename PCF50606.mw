[[Neo1973_Power_Management]] Seems to have updated information now, covering more than the pmu-voltage.txt file - and not derivable from there. Should this page be deleted?--[[User:Speedevil|Speedevil]] 01:39, 21 February 2007 (CET)

== Overview ==

The PCF50606 is the Power Management Unit used in GTA01.  Apparently this unit is very popular in MP3 players, as the Rockbox project has talked a lot about writing a driver for it (but hasn't completed any, as far as we know).

Configuration of this PMU is done via an [[I2C]] bus from the [[S3C2410]].

The PMU also connects to EINT16 and thus can issue interrupts to the main CPU.

=== Register dump after bootup ===

Since [[u-boot]] has built-in I2C support for the S3C2410, we can read out the register set of the PC50606 using a simple command:
