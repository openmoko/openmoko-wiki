== OpenMoko and WiFi ==

The OpenMoko project would love to add WiFi support to any the devices on the roadmap.

However, we simply are unable to locate a supplier with a suitable product!

== Public call for WiFi ==

From [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2007-March/004195.html this mailinglist posting]:
<pre>
We can't find a WiFi Chipset with GPL'ed drivers -- We know 
this has been discussed (to death) on this list, but as we're 
beginning work on the next summer hardware refresh we still can't seem
to find a vendor that meets our strict requirements: Namely, we refuse
to put anything binary in the kernel. 

Marvell has some nice for larger devices (the 8388). But we need
one specifically for mobile phones (like the 8686). If somebody 
can help us find the right vendor, we'll give you a free Neo1973. 
  
If you're a vendor and want to work with us to GPL your driver, we'll 
give you lots of business -- and a free phone ;-)

=== Regular chipsets are NOT suitable ===

Please notice that it is '''impossible''' for us to use any of the standard '''desktop''' WiFi chipsets, commonly found in miniPCI cards or USB WiFi adapters.

We really need a chipset (and even beyond that: Somebody manufacturing SMT modules with that chipset) that is specifically targetted for mobile phones or other mobile devices such as portable media players.

Regular WiFi chipsets just draw way too much power and are too large by an order of magnitude.

== List of chipset vendors who are known to be at least partially GPL friendly ==

* Marvell (only 8385 Libertas chipset)
* Zydas
* Ralink

=== Atheros ===

==== AR6k ====

This sounds like a really great device
