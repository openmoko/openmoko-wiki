The GSM-connector to be found near one of the screws 
(see [[Disassembling Neo 1973]] in wiki) is:

MURATA MM8430-2610RB3 SMD RF TEST PORT

For a nice fitting adapter see: http://www.google.de/search?q=MXHS83QE3000

There is no hole for the antenna in the back of the case but you can make one easily with a soldering iron or a drill.
