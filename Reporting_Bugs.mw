You can report a bug/defect at [https://docs.openmoko.org/trac/].  Just create an account. After email validation of your account, you can log in. You will see a new button labeled "New Ticket".

You can also (of course) search for existing bugs on the bug tracker. In fact, you should do so prior adding new tickets to avoid double reporting the same issue.
