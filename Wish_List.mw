=== Printing Support ===
It would be really neat to be able to print over either bluetooth or USB. I could imagine wanted to print:

* Notes
* Maps
* Email
* Calendars
* ...

Cups contains a bluetooth printing backend, so (in theory) once you have your data in postscript format, you could hand it to cups and it'll do the rest. In practice, it depends on

# GTK+'s printing support
# Making cups run on a really small system

{{note| GTK+'s printing support seems to be very immature in 2.6 (which we need to use for some time). Gtk+ 2.10 contains much better printing support -- once we can use this, it should be more easy.

There's always the possibility to render postscript ourselves, but this is not a piece of cake -- in general, printing is much harder than one would imagine.

=== Python Bindings ===
Python bindings seem to be a commonly requested feature.  

[[User:Mickey]] says, "They are kind of usable on the [http://www.maemo.org Nokia 770], but it's at the lower end of being bearable. We should keep this in mind -- Gtk+ already comes with Python Bindings, so we "just" would need to wrap libmoko*. I would prefer to leave this to the community do though, since it doesn't make sense to start wrapping the API until we have a stable API -- and I can imagine it will take us a couple of months after going open until we can start with stabilizing the libmoko API."
