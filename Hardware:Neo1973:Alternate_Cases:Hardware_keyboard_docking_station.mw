Alternate case for the Neo1973, to allow stable, rigid connection to a small USB/Bluetooth keyboard

==Concept==
A case with a mechanical connection to an external USB/Bluetooth-attached keyboard, such as the [http://www.expansys.com/p.aspx?i=124250 Freedom mini Bluetooth keyboard]. The phone would have a mount on the back to allow stable, rigid attachment to the keyboard (either in portrait or landscape orientation), for a similar setup to the game controller.<br>
