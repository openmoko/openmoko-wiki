= eet -- '''Way to change enlightenment .cfg files''' =

I've got recently this mail from enlightenment mailing list:

you have to use "eet" command line utility, it is the tool that reads
.src and turns then into .cfg if you check out Makefile (and
Makefile.am).

  eet -l e.cfg  # list all keys, usually just "config"
  eet -d e.cfg config e.src # writes human readable values to file e.src
  $EDITOR e.src # change whatever you like
  eet -e e.cfg config e.src 1  # compile human readable values to binary form and use compression

If you find that useful and want to help, please create a wiki page
with your new knowledge.


More complete instruction will appear tomorrow
