= eet -- '''Way to change enlightenment .cfg files''' =

I've got recently this mail from enlightenment mailing list:

you have to use "eet" command line utility, it is the tool that reads
.src and turns then into .cfg if you check out Makefile (and
Makefile.am).

  eet -l e.cfg  # list all keys, usually just "config"
  eet -d e.cfg config e.src # writes human readable values to file e.src
  $EDITOR e.src # change whatever you like
  eet -e e.cfg config e.src 1  # compile human readable values to binary form and use compression

If you find that useful and want to help, please create a wiki page
with your new knowledge.

= interesting illume cfg files =
{{note | After any change you must delete directory /home/root/.e/e/config/asu to force configuration reload}}
{{warning | All your changes to illume configuration (usually not so many) will be lost}}
{{note | Maybe it's possible to edit directly files in you home directory, I don't know}}

Add this in group 'group "E_Config_Gadcon"' after block named " illume-bluetooth" (ASU 2008.12 line 431) to enable Wrench tool (but most of configuration dialogs are not defined in .edj files..)

      group "clients" list {
        group "E_Config_Gadcon_Client" struct {
          value "name" string: "illume-cfg";
          value "id" string: "illume-cfg";
          value "geom.pos" int: 0;
          value "geom.size" int: 32;

(not done yet, but that code will switch qpe keyboard to illume)
