Openmoko is a project driven by a community of passionate volunteers. This includes the implementation, testing and improving of the open source code on the one side. On the other side any software is created for the benefit of users and these users are normally not developers. User Maunals like the [[SHR User Manual]] helps people, who are not involved the coding part of the project to use the distributions and applications on the freerunner. User Manuals make it easier for them to get started. Involving people that are not developers could be of benefit for the developers to keep usability in mind so that feedback will be possible for the non-developers at early developing stages. If you are not a developer you have certainly the ability to share, your problems especially with GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces) and discriptions of workflows in installations procedures. Your contributions are extremly welcome to improve the User Manuals itself and in the long run having influence on the software itself. 

Openmoko's ambitions far exceed the resources available, so your contributions as a non developer could be:
* '''Improve existing User Manuals''' like [[SHR User Manual]], when you install the e.g. SHR for the first time and configure SHR on your OpenMoko with the help of the user manual, mention problems with the manual according to your personal installation procedure and if your solved the problem document your solution in this wiki or add a link that . differences in the way.
* '''Create a new user manual''' e.g. for [[OM2009 User Manual]]
* '''Add screenshots''' to the manual at the explaintions when images can say more than 1000 words and make it easier for other users to follow the procedure. You can make screenshots on many distributions with 
** e.g. gpe-scap which you can install on your freerunner, if it is not installed on you system. 
** Download the screenshots from you freerunner with scp or sftp from your desktop computer
** Create a link for images in the wiki edit mode (press ''edit'' in the manual and look for this text in the manual, there you find the link for embedded images) [[Image:Example123.jpg]]. You can click on the link and upload the image to the wiki.
** You can replace images by new ones due to change in graphical user interfaces. The wiki keep track of older versions and replacing an image will not overwrite it.

'''Remark:''' Please do not upload images to <tt>Example123.jpg</tt> here on this page, so that people can see the results of just inserting an image tag in wiki text without uploading.
 
==Screenshots for Documentations==
The screenshots are made with <tt>gpe-scap</tt>, that can be installed by:
  opkg install gpe-scap
if not installed already. Navigate through the application your want create screenshots for and login via ssh on your Freerunner from your desktop computer.
  ssh -l root 192.168.0.202
assuming that your Freerunner has the IP 192.168.0.202.
Any time you want to make a screenshot just start <tt>gpe-scap</tt> on the freerunner via your desktop computer 
  gpe-scap
and save the screenshot to you freerunner. This is more convenient than starting the gpe-scap making a screenshot with time delay and then you have to rush to the applications menu you need a screenshot from.

Download the screenshots to your desktop computer with
  desktop# sftp://root@192.168.0.202
An upload them into the documentation and insert an image tag a the desired position.
  .[.[Image:myscreenshot1.jpg.].].
You might want to resize the image und provide a subtitle
  .[.[Image:myscreenshot1.jpg|200px|thumb|My first Screeshot.].].

'''Note:'''register as a wiki user by creating an account in the wiki system when want you upload images.
