The Neo1973 device contains an integrated GPS. The particular device
is marketed as an AGPS, and there is some [[Hardware:AGPS |
discussion]] available as to what significance that "A" might have.

All purchased phones do not include the GPS binary driver.  [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2007-July/008466.html] 
But finally, as described in [[November_29%2C_2007_Community_Update]], the binary driver is available to the community now.

In the very early shipment to 50 Phase 1 developers, a binary-only program for talking to the the GPS was accidentally included 
in /home/root/DM2/gps, (and presumably, the same binary would function on a P0 device). 

There is an ongoing effort to write a Free Software
program that could be used instead of this binary-only program. See
[[Hammerhead/Protocol]] for details and the latest status.

== Quick test (driver output to console) on Neo1973 Phase 1 ==
''Main article: [[Getting GPS console output with gllin]]''

To get the output of this driver, read the file /tmp/nmeaNP (it is actually a pipe, not a file). The simplest way is to open another ssh connection to the phone and use cat:
 cat /tmp/nmeaNP

This way it is possible to see the first results very easily.

== Binary Daemon GLLIN ==

For those few with the binary driver in the meantime, Pavel Machek
[http://pavelmachek.livejournal.com/39229.html provides] the
following script for recording an NMEA stream from the binary program.

 #!/bin/sh
 echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/gta01\:vibrator/brightness
 killall gllin cat
 sleep 1
 echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/gta01\:vibrator/brightness
 mknod /tmp/nmeaNP p
 cat /tmp/nmeaNP >> /tmp/gps.nmea &
 /home/root/DM2/gps/gllin -low 5
 /home/root/DM2/gps/gllin -periodic 3

The binary program was compiled to OABI format which now is obsolete as OM2007.2 builds are in EABI format. You can still run the binary with ''chroot''. [[user:Zdanek|Bartek Zdanowski]] wrote an [http://www.openmoko.org.pl/node/55 aticle] how to run GPS receiver. Alternativly ld-linux can be used to do the trick:

==The ld-linux trick==

you need the following files:

 bin/gllin
 bin/gllin.sh
 lib/ld-linux.so.2
 lib/libc.so.6
 lib/libgcc_s.so.1
 lib/libm.so.6
 lib/libnss_dns.so.2
 lib/libnss_files.so.2
 lib/libpthread.so.0
 lib/libresolv.so.2
 lib/librt.so.1
 lib/libstdc++.so.6
 lib/libutil.so.1

the file bin/gllin.sh contains:

 #!/bin/sh
 `pwd`/lib/ld-linux.so.2 --library-path `pwd`/lib `pwd`/bin/gllin -low 5
 test -p /tmp/nmeaNP || ( rm -f /tmp/nmeaNP && mknod /tmp/nmeaNP p )
 `pwd`/lib/ld-linux.so.2 --library-path `pwd`/lib `pwd`/bin/gllin -periodic 3

be shure to start at least a `cat /tmp/nmeaNP` somewhere.

another aproach (chroot) is described in [[Gllin]] - here is also a link to a archive with all needed shared libraries in the right format.

==Strange effects==

the message 

 Stack size 8864 bytes (9 KB)

means, nobody is reading on the pipe /tmp/nmeaNP, you probably forgot to start the `cat ...`. 

the message

 gllin: early exit(3) in halInit()/681

is issued by the low-level hardware test but gllin works fine afterwords.

do not use the option

 +daemon

because gllin writes all files to /tmp then which is a bad idea. because /tmp is ram it is lost. because ram is limited the logfile will eat up your memmory.

== Bluetooth GPS ==

He also [http://pavelmachek.livejournal.com/39659.html succeeded]
at getting the Neo1973 to act like a bluetooth GPS with the following
script: (Note that this script has bad problems if you run it more than once. You can get a "time traveling GPS" effect, with the GPS showing you your past position).

 #!/bin/sh
 killall rfcomm tail
 mknod /dev/rfcomm0 c 216 0
 echo 1 > /sys/devices/platform/s3c2410-i2c/i2c-0/0-0008/gta01-pm-bt.0/power_on
 sleep 1
 hciconfig hci0 up name linuxgps
 sleep 1
 sdpd
 sleep 1
 sdptool add SP
 (
         while true; do
         rfcomm listen /dev/rfcomm0 1
         sleep 1
         done
 ) &
 (
         while true; do
             tail -f /tmp/gps.nmea > /dev/rfcomm0
             echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/gta01\:vibrator/brightness
             sleep 1
             echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/gta01\:vibrator/brightness
         done
 ) &

== Using UDP ==

gllin sends a udp packet per nmea sentence on port 6000. this is a much cleaner aproach because using files will fill up memory or rootfs (the latter will result in the need for reflashing).

i switch off writing to /tmp/nmeaNP and logging to log/... with

 -np
 -nmea

the help says that -nmea is the default, fact is that gllin logs nmea sentences into ./log/<date> wich will fill up mem or rootfs for long running tests. the following python script reads the nmea sentences:

 import socket
 s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
 s.bind(('127.0.0.1', 6000))
 while True:
     line = s.recv(1024)
     print line

the program just prints those to stdout but other methods are possible (i feed them into a NMEA parser).

benefits are that both programs can be started and stopped at will. none needs the other. gllin will not terminate if /tmp/nmeaNP is not there or not read from. the `cat /tmp/nmeaNP | gzip > gps.gz` is a useless idea anyway because the files in log/ (current directory) contains the NMEA data already.

== NMEA ==
The ouput from the binary driver seems to follow the NMEA standard. 

Some information about it is available at [http://gpsinformation.org/dale/nmea.htm gpsinformation.org] and on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA Wikipedia].
