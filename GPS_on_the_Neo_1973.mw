The Neo1973 device contains an integrated GPS. The particular device
is marketed as an AGPS, and there is some [[Hardware:AGPS |
discussion]] available as to what significance that "A" might have.

As of P1, a binary-only program for talking the the GPS is available
in /home/root/DM2/gps, (and presumably, the same binary would function
on a P0 device). There is an ongoing effort to write a Free Software
program that could be used instead of this binary-only program. See
[[Hammerhead_protocol]] for details and the latest status.

In the meantime, Pavel Machek
[http://pavelmachek.livejournal.com/39229.html provides] the
following script for recording an NMEA stream from the binary program:

 #!/bin/sh
 echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/gta01\:vibrator/brightness
 killall gllin cat
 sleep 1
 echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/gta01\:vibrator/brightness
 mknod /tmp/nmeaNP p
 cat /tmp/nmeaNP | tee /media/card/gps.nmea >> /tmp/gps.nmea &
 /home/root/DM2/gps/gllin -low 5
 strace /home/root/DM2/gps/gllin >> /tmp/gps.strace 2>&1

He also [http://pavelmachek.livejournal.com/39659.html succeeded]
at getting the Neo1973 to act like a bluetooth GPS with the following
script:

 #!/bin/sh
 mknod /dev/rfcomm0 c 216 0
 echo 1 > /sys/devices/platform/s3c2410-i2c/i2c-0/0-0008/gta01-pm-bt.0/power_on
 sleep 1
 hciconfig hci0 up name linuxgps
 sleep 1
 sdpd
 sleep 1
 sdptool add SP
 (
 	while true; do
 	rfcomm listen /dev/rfcomm0 1
 	sleep 1
 	done
 ) &
 (
 	while true; do
 	tail -f /tmp/gps.nmea > /dev/rfcomm0
 	sleep 1
 	done
 ) &

As people develop more sophisticated GPS applications, please note them here.

Here are some ideas for possibilites:

* Cairo-based mapping

* Routing

* Openstreetmap logger, (with voice annotations)

See [[openstreetmap]] - this is a page which needs fleshed out to a proper application page.
