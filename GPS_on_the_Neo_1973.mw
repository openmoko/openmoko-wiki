The Neo1973 device contains an integrated GPS. The particular device
is marketed as an AGPS, and there is some [[Hardware:AGPS |
discussion]] available as to what significance that "A" might have.

All purchased phones do not include the GPS binary driver.  [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2007-July/008466.html]

In the very early shipment to 50 Phase 1 developers, a binary-only program for talking to the the GPS was accidentally included 
in /home/root/DM2/gps, (and presumably, the same binary would function on a P0 device). 

There is an ongoing effort to write a Free Software
program that could be used instead of this binary-only program. See
[[Hammerhead/Protocol]] for details and the latest status.

For those few with the binary driver in the meantime, Pavel Machek
[http://pavelmachek.livejournal.com/39229.html provides] the
following script for recording an NMEA stream from the binary program:

 #!/bin/sh
 echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/gta01\:vibrator/brightness
 killall gllin cat
 sleep 1
 echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/gta01\:vibrator/brightness
 mknod /tmp/nmeaNP p
 cat /tmp/nmeaNP >> /tmp/gps.nmea &
 /home/root/DM2/gps/gllin -low 5
 /home/root/DM2/gps/gllin -periodic 3

He also [http://pavelmachek.livejournal.com/39659.html succeeded]
at getting the Neo1973 to act like a bluetooth GPS with the following
script: (Note that this script has bad problems if you run it more than once. You can get a "time traveling GPS" effect, with the GPS showing you your past position).

 #!/bin/sh
 killall rfcomm tail
 mknod /dev/rfcomm0 c 216 0
 echo 1 > /sys/devices/platform/s3c2410-i2c/i2c-0/0-0008/gta01-pm-bt.0/power_on
 sleep 1
 hciconfig hci0 up name linuxgps
 sleep 1
 sdpd
 sleep 1
 sdptool add SP
 (
         while true; do
         rfcomm listen /dev/rfcomm0 1
         sleep 1
         done
 ) &
 (
         while true; do
             tail -f /tmp/gps.nmea > /dev/rfcomm0
             echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/gta01\:vibrator/brightness
             sleep 1
             echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/gta01\:vibrator/brightness
         done
 ) &


=== Possible GPS programs ===

As people develop more sophisticated GPS applications, please note them here.

Here are some ideas for possibilities:

* Cairo-based mapping

* Routing

* [[Openstreetmap]] logger, (with voice annotations)

* [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2007-July/007252.html collection of ideas]
