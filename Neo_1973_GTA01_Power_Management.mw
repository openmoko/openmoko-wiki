This page details the power management of the Phase 1 Neo1973. Much of it is inapplicable to earlier models.


Power management is of utmost concern to any mobile device.  
Battery power is quite limited, so we need to make sure we try our best to conserve it. (See also [[Power management requirements]].)

This is very much unimplemented at the moment. 

''Update'': The standby mode works most of the time, and the wake-up-from-call functionality works, too. Some settings need to be changed. For details, have a look [[GTA01Standby|here]].

This page tries to describe the various power management features of the [[:Category:Neo1973 Hardware | Neo1973 Hardware]], their states, transitions, etc.  First, we start by describing the power states of the individual hardware components.  Then we look at it from a System Integration point of view.


== S3C2410 SoC ==

The [[Neo1973 Power Management#S3C2410 SoC | S3C2410 SoC section]] is an overview of the S3C2410 power states or modes and their capabilities. The S3C2410 has the following modes:

==== System design considerations ====
In order to fully support Power_off mode, we need to
* Be able to switch off VDDi/VDDiarm/VDDi_MPLL/VDDi_UPLL separately from VDDalive

== PCF50606 PMU ==

This is an overview of the PCF50606 power modes / state transitions

=== NOPOWER ===

Condition: Vbat < Vverylowbat && Vback < Vlowback && Vchgvin < Vlowchg

Human-Readable: If main battery voltage < 2.7V and backup battery voltage < 1.3V and charger voltage < 2.7V

=== SAVE ===

Condition: Vbat < Vverylowbat && (Vback > Vlowback || Vchgvin > Vlowchg)

Human-readable: If main battery voltage < 2.7V and at least backup battery voltage > 1.3V or charger voltage > 2.7V.

=== STANDBY ===

Condition: Vbat > Vverylowbat

Human-readable: If main battery voltage > 2.7V

=== ACTIVE ===

Condition: Vbat > Vlowbat
Human-Readable: If main battery voltage > 2.8V (configurable up to 3.4V)
Transition from STANDBY to ACTIVE: If ONKEY button is pressed, or RTC Alarm, or EXTON or charger insert or pen-down by touchscreen (we don't use the PMU TS controller)

== JBT6K74 LCM ==

=== Deep Standby ===

In this mode, only the supply power is activated

=== Sleep ===

Holds register data with clock stopped

=== Normal ===

Fully powered up and operational

== System Level ==

This is a description of the system-level power management.

=== System Power states ===

In order to do system-level power management, we need to introduce state definitions with their according state names.  The state names are prefixed by SYS_POWER_.

=== Wake-up reasons ===

In the following events, we want the main CPU to be able to be woken up from Power_off (SYS_POWER_SLEEP) state:

==== Events from GSM ====

* Incoming phone call
* Incoming SMS
* Loss of network signal

===== Implementation =====

The GSM daemon configures the GSM Modem so as to wake the CPU when events happen.

The S3C2410 has the EINT0 pin of the S3C2410 connected to the GSM modem, which wakes it on configured events.

==== GPIO from Bluetooth ====

PIO_2 of the DFBM-CS320 is connected to GPC7 of the s3c2410.<br>
PIO_5 of the DFBM-CS320 is connected to GPC5 of the s3c2410.<br>
BT_EN of the DFBM-CS320 is connected to GPB5 if the s3c2410. [http://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/doc/hardware/GTA01Bv4/gpio.txt]

==== Button Press ====

If somebody pushes either the [[Neo1973 Aux Button]] or the [[Neo1973 Power Button]], the system shall wake up.
===== Implementation =====

====== Power Button ======
During suspend, the PMU is configured to allow PWRONF events to generate interrupts to the CPU.
(This is if PWR_IRQ is the internal signal from the PMU, mentioned in gpio.txt)

====== Aux Button ======
The Aux button is connected the EINT6 pin, which can wake-up the CPU from Power_off. 

This means that resuming on Aux button will work out-of-the-box

==== Charger Events ====

If a charger plug (or any other USB device) is connected, the device shall resume and update the battery [charger] status. Also, charger errors such as over/undervoltage, over/under-temperature shall be reported.

===== Implementation =====
During suspend, the PMU is configured to allow EXTONR,CHGERR and related events to generate interrupts to the CPU.

In GTA01Bv4, the PMU IRQ is connected to EINT9.

{{note|Up to GTA01Bv3, the PMU IRQ is connected to EINT16, i.e. an interrupt source that cannot wake-up from Power_off mode!}}

== Kernel API ==

== Userspace API ==

== Approximate power draw of various subsystems ==

In P0 and P1 phones, the battery has a total of 1200mAh, at 3.6V. This is approximately 3500mWh, once power supply losses are taken into account. The figures below are estimates from datasheets.

These do not take into account the severe hardware bugs of phase 0 hardware, which severely affect power use.

* LCD 
**  150mW with backlight at full brightness
**  15mW with backlight at 10%
* CPU
**  320mW @ 200MHz
**  450mW @ 266MHz
**  140mW @ 200MHz idle.
**  50mW @ 12MHz (slow mode)
*** These include fudge factors for RAM and other systems, from the CPU datasheet.
*RAM 600mW at 600Mbytes/sec, power use broadly proportional to transfer rate.
* Bluetooth
**  63mW @ Tx Burst (file transfer, send)
**  36mW @ Rx Burst (file transfer, receive)
**  3.6mW @ Idle, beacon only
*** Based on the datasheets provided
* GSM ?
**Idle, but connected to network, 45mW
**Active on a call - up to 600mW, closer to tower less.
* GPS
** 45mW
*** Rough measurement

Recommended clock speeds: 12 33.75 45 48 50.7 56.25 67.5 79 84.75 90 101.25 113.0 118.5 124.0 135.0 147.0 152 158 170 180 186 192 202.8 266 268 270

Other clock speeds are possible (in the 33.75-266Mhz range) by setting the PLL, however, the datasheet strongly recommends these, and recommends contacting samsung for speeds not listed above.

This would imply that with the CPU constantly on in low power mode, GPS and GSM blipping on and off, and display off, the worst case power consumption is probably around 70mW, leading to a battery life of 2 days.
If the CPU is turned off, battery life rises significantly.

With everything on, playing video with sound, for example should get well over 3 hours. (500mW LCD + 320mW CPU + 200mW audio + 50mW GPS.  4.5Wh at 1.1W draw) 

Both voltage and clock speed to the CPU core can be altered.
Exactly how this will work with the hardware is yet to be determined.
It is possible that it may be capable of playing MP3s with the CPU clock at 60Mhz. This would considerably extend battery to well over 10 hours. Optimistically >24 hours of mp3.

The lowest power state I have gotten the Neo1973 phase-1 to run in is 90mA or so, for a life of some 12 hours.
This is with backlight, GSM modem, bluetooth, GPS, off, the CPU clocked at 100Mhz, and undervolted to 1.8V, connected over usb-net (not powered via USB)

8 hours playing mp3 at moderate volume. (same caveats as above.)

== Measured power draw on phase 0 neo1973 ==

I played with old ampermeter, old nokia 3110 (as a power supply) and phase0 neo1973 a bit. It appears to eat 1.02 mW while powered off, 1.02W while booted (backlight on), ~0.51W while sleeping (with backlight on) and 1.4W while loading applications.


== Discharge graph == 
[[User:JoSch|JoSch]] did a graph of battery volt versus time that can be found [http://rabenfrost.net/openmoko/battvolt2.png here].

== Logging battery parameters to troubleshoot charging ==

'''WARNING'''

'''After installing and starting this script my Neo battery went flat in < 1 hour. Previously it was fine even overnight. If your battery is so flat that the Neo will not boot then leave it plugged in to a USB port for 15-20 minutes before powering up.'''


Some neos have managed to discharge their battery down to empty while off, plugged in, and supposedly charging from a 500ma-capable usb device.  In order to help figure out how the state of charge changes while charging, running of battery, sleeping on battery, and sleeping while connected to usb, download two scripts in http://wile.org/stuff/power.tar  Put the power-watch script in /usr/local/bin/ and the powerlog script in /etc/init.d, then 

 # ln -s ../init.d/powerlog /etc/rc5.d/S15powerlog

so that it starts up with the neo.

The script logs the time, battery voltage, charging current, battery temperature, charging mode, bluetooth-on status, gps-on status, gsm-on status, and backlight brightness numbers.  The [[Kernel#Battery_charging_current|kernel page]] claims the charging current is in ma, but that does not appear to be the case for all builds? eg 2.6.21.6-moko10.  The battery temperature does not always appear to be in degrees C, either.

After a few runs we can calibrate volts-to-remaining power, and then estimate off or sleep current draw and charging rate by observing the power drop [or rise] vs time between successive os boots.
