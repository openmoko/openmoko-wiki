== Voltages ==

=== VB ===

* Battery terminal voltage
* Used by
** [[LM4857]] Amplifier
** [[PCF50606]] PMU
** LCM Backlight
** U7607 AVDD regulator
** U7608 VTXCO_2V8 regulator

=== CORE_1V8 ===
This is the S3C2410 Core Voltage

* Generated by PMU DCUD

=== IO_3V3 ===

* Generated by PMU DCDE
* Used by
** Vibrator
** FLASH_3V3 (see below)

** S3C2410 EXTCLK ???
** SDRAM

=== GL_3V3 ===

* Generated by PMU DCDF

* Used by
** AGPS

* Controlled by
** PMU

==== PM Driver ====

* Switch on/off if GPS is used or not

==== Initial state ====

* disabled by u-boot PMU initialization

=== CODEC_3V3 ===

* Generated by PMU IOVDD

* Used for
** Audio Codec (digital and analog)

* Controlled by
** PMU Driver

==== PM Driver ====

* mostly included in ASoC, right?
* switch on, only if Audio path is required.

==== Initial state ====

* disabled by PMU initialization in u-boot

=== LCM_3V3 ===

* Generated by PMU LPVDDD

* Used by
** Headset/GSM Uart Latch
** LCM

==== PM Driver ====

* check whether we really need to switch this off, since LCM has sophisticated PM features

==== Initial state ====

* enabled by u-boot PMU initialization

=== BT_3V15 ===

* Generated by PMU D1REG

==== PM Driver ====

* has to be powered up before Bluetooth can be used
* Bluetooth device automatically enumerates at bus

==== Initial state ====

* disabled by u-boot PMU initialization

=== GL_2V5 ===

* Generated by PMU D2REG

* Used by
** AGPS

* Controlled by
** PMU Driver

==== PM Driver ====

* switch on only in case GPS is enabled

==== Initial state ====

* disable by u-boot GPIO initialization

=== USER1 ===

FIXME: no idea what this is for

* Generated by PMU D3REG

==== PMU Driver ====

* permanently disabled

==== Initial state ====

* disabled by PMU initialization in u-boot

=== FLASH_3V3 ===

* Derived from IO_3V3

* Used by
**  NAND Flash

* Controlled by
** SD_EN GPIO

==== PM Driver ====

* do we really want to switch it on/off before every flash access?
* if we go to standby, IO_3V3 will be switched off, thus FLASH_3V3 is off, too

==== Initial state ====

* on, enabled by u-boot GPIO initialization

=== AVDD ===

* Generated by U6707

* Used by
** AGPS

* Controlled by
** EN_AGPS3V GPIO

==== PM Driver ====

* Switch on only if GPS enabled

=== VTCXO_2V8 ===

* Generated by U7608

* Used by
** AGPS

* Controlled by
** EN_GPS2V8 GPIO

==== PM Driver ====

* enable only if GPS is used.

==== Initial State ====

* disabled by u-boot GPIO initialization

=== SD_3V3 ===

* Derived from IO_3V3

* Used by
** microSD slot

* Controlled by
** SD_ON GPIO

==== PM Driver ====

* we don't want to switch this off while mounted, do we?


==== Initial state ====

* probably disabled, unless somebody uses 'mmcinit' from u-boot
* but we can't disable it without disabling NAND.
* result: enabled by u-boot GPIO initialization

== Kernel API ==

== Userspace API ==

== Approximate power draw of various subsystems. Estimated from datasheets.==

The battery has a total of 1200mAh, at 3.6V. This is approximately 3500mWh, once power supply losses are taken into account.

* LCD 
**  200mW with backlight at full brightness
**  40mW with backlight at 10%
***  Based on similar 2.8" LCDs.
* CPU
**  320mW @ 200MHz
**  450mW @ 266MHz
**  140mW @ 200MHz idle.
**  50mW @ 12MHz (slow mode)
*** These include fudge factors for RAM and other systems, from the CPU datasheet.
* Bluetooth ?
* GSM ?
* GPS
** 25mA
*** Based on comparison with a broadly similar (though not as fully featured chip [http://www.maxim-ic.com/appnotes.cfm/an_pk/3447 from Maxim]

USB seems unlikely to work in slow mode. The LCD controller is unknown - the product notes say that it has RAM, which may imply it can self-refresh.

This would imply that with the CPU constantly on in low power mode, GPS and GSM blipping on and off, and display off, the worst case power consumption is probably around 70mW, leading to a battery life of 2 days.
If the CPU is turned off, battery life rises significantly.

With everything on, playing video with sound, for example should get well over 4 hours.
