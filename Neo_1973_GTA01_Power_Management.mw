== Voltages ==

=== VB ===

* Battery terminal voltage
* Used by
** [[LM4857]] Amplifier
** [[PCF50606]] PMU
** LCM Backlight
** U7607 AVDD regulator
** U7608 VTXCO_2V8 regulator

=== CORE_1V8 ===
This is the S3C2410 Core Voltage

* Generated by PMU DCUD

=== IO_3V3 ===

* Generated by PMU DCDE
* Used by
** Vibrator
** FLASH_3V3 (see below)
** Touch panel transistors
** S3C2410 VDDA_ADC
** S3C2410 VDDOP
** S3C2410 VDDMOP
** S3C2410 nBATT_FLT
** U1502 (latch for GSM UART)
** S3C2410 EXTCLK ???
** SDRAM

=== GL_3V3 ===

* Generated by PMU DCDF

* Used by
** AGPS

* Controlled by
** PMU

==== PM Driver ====

* Switch on/off if GPS is used or not

=== CODEC_3V3 ===

* Generated by PMU IOVDD

* Used for
** Audio Codec (digital and analog)

* Controlled by
** PMU Driver

==== PM Driver ====

* mostly included in ASoC, right?
* switch on, only if Audio path is required.

==== Initial state ====

* disabled by PMU initialization in u-boot

=== LCM_3V3 ===

* Generated by PMU LPVDDD

* Used by
** Headset/GSM Uart Latch
** LCM

=== BT_3V15 ===

* Generated by PMU D1REG

==== PMU Driver ====

* has to be powered up before Bluetooth can be used
* Bluetooth device automatically enumerates at bus

=== GL_2V5 ===

* Generated by PMU D2REG

* Used by
** AGPS

* Controlled by
** PMU Driver

==== PM Driver ====

* switch on only in case GPS is enabled

==== Initial state ====

* disable by u-boot GPIO initialization

=== USER1 ===

FIXME: no idea what this is for

* Generated by PMU D3REG

==== PMU Driver ====

* permanently disabled

==== Initial state ====

* disabled by PMU initialization in u-boot

=== FLASH_3V3 ===

* Derived from IO_3V3
* Powers NAND Flash

==== PM Driver ====

* do we really want to switch it on/off before every flash access?
* if we go to standby, IO_3V3 will be switched off, thus FLASH_3V3 is off, too

=== AVDD ===

* Generated by U6707

* Used by
** AGPS

* Controlled by
** EN_AGPS3V GPIO

==== PM Driver ====

* Switch on only if GPS enabled

=== VTCXO_2V8 ===

* Generated by U7608

* Used by
** AGPS

* Controlled by
** EN_GPS2V8 GPIO

==== PM Driver ====

* enable only if GPS is used.

==== Initial State ====

* disabled by u-boot GPIO initialization

=== SD_3V3 ===

* Derived from IO_3V3

* Used by
** microSD slot

* Controlled by
** SD_ON GPIO
