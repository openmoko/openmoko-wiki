Power management is of utmost concern to any mobile device.  Battery power is quite limited, so we need to make sure we try our best to conserve it.  The [[Neo1973 Power Management |Neo1973 Power Management page]] tries to describe the various power management features of the [[:Category:Neo1973 Hardware | Neo1973 Hardware]], their states, transitions, etc.  First, we start by describing the power states of the individual hardware components.  Then we look at it from a System Integration point of view.


== S3C2410 SoC ==

The [[Neo1973 Power Management#S3C2410 SoC | S3C2410 SoC section]] is an overview of the S3C2410 power states or modes and their capabilities. The S3C2410 has the following modes:

* [[Neo1973 Power Management#Normal Mode | Normal Mode]]
* [[Neo1973 Power Management#Idle Mode | Idle Mode]]
* [[Neo1973 Power Management#Slow Mode | Slow Mode]]
* [[Neo1973 Power Management#Power_off Mode | Power_off Mode]]

=== Normal Mode ===

This is the most power-consuming mode.  Regular operation at full clock speed (266MHz).
The typical power consumption is 335mW in this mode.

We can dynamically reduce the CPU core clock speed to lower frequencies, if required.

=== Idle Mode ===

In this mode, FCLK to the CPU core is switched off.  This reduces the power consumption to about half the typical 'Normal mode' consumption: 177mW

==== Wake-up sources ====

any interrupt.

=== Slow Mode ===

In slow mode, FCLK is tied to the external crystal, i.e. 12MHz in our case.  The CPU core, SDRAM and bus clocks are also running at 12MHz.

This reduces the power consumption to typically 33mW.

==== Wake-up sources ====

none, we can just use our slowly running code to switch back to Normal mode, if it's required.

=== Power_off Mode ===

In Power_off mode, only the SDRAM is held in refresh, and the SoC-internal wake-up logic and  RTC is powered.  This means that the overall power consumption of the CPU goes down to max. 100uA, which translates to 200uW at 2.0V core voltage.

==== Wake-up sources ====

The number of wake-up sources is more restricted in this mode:

* EINT[0...15]
* RTC Alarm Interrupt
* nBATT_FAULT pin

==== System design considerations ====

In order to fully support Power_off mode, we need to
* Be able to switch off VDDi/VDDiarm/VDDi_MPLL/VDDi_UPLL separately from VDDalive, using a switch based on the PWREN signal

== PCF50606 PMU ==

This is an overview of the PCF50606 power modes / state transitions

=== NOPOWER ===

Condition: Vbat < Vverylowbat && Vback < Vlowback && Vchgvin < Vlowchg

Human-Readable: If main battery voltage < 2.7V and backup battery voltage < 1.3V and charger voltage < 2.7V

=== SAVE ===

Condition: Vbat < Vverylowbat && (Vback > Vlowback || Vchgvin > Vlowchg)

Human-readable: If main battery voltage < 2.7V and at least backup battery voltage > 1.3V or charger voltage > 2.7V.

=== STANDBY ===

Condition: Vbat > Vverylowbat

Human-readable: If main battery voltage > 2.7V

=== ACTIVE ===

Condition: Vbat > Vlowbat
Human-Readable: If main battery voltage > 2.8V (configurable up to 3.4V)
Transition from STANDBY to ACTIVE: If ONKEY button is pressed, or RTC Alarm, or EXTON or charger insert or pen-down by touchscreen (we don't use the PMU TS controller)

== JBT6K74 LCM ==

=== Deep Standby ===

In this mode, only the supply power is activated

=== Sleep ===

Holds register data with clock stopped

=== Normal ===

Fully powered up and operational

== System Level ==

This is a description of the system-level power management.

=== System Power states ===

In order to do system-level power managment, we need to introduce state definitions with their according state names.  The state names are prefixed by SYS_POWER_.

==== SYS_POWER_NO ====

In this state, there is no main battery and no USB charger voltage applied. However, the backup battery is supposed to be operational.

* PCF50606: SAVE
* S3C2410: unpowered
* JBT6K74: unpowered by PMU
* GSM: unpovered because no Vbatt
* GPS: unpowered by PMU
* Bluetooth: unpowered by PMU
* Backlight: powered off

==== SYS_POWER_OFF ====

This is the regular, "switched off" state of the device.  The device does not provide any functionality.

* PCF50606: STANDBY
* S3C2410: unpowered by PMU
* GSM: Powered down by driving MODEM_ON to LOW
* GPS: unpowererd by PMU
* JBT6K74: unpowered by PMU
* Bluetooth: unpowered by PMU
* Backlight: powered off

==== SYS_POWER_ON_FULL ====

This is the regular, "fully switched on" state of the device, during user interaction.

* PCF50606: ACTIVE
* S3C2410: NORMAL
* GSM: Powered up by driving MODEM_ON to HIGH
* GPS: Depending usage / configuration
* Bluetooth: Depending usage / configuration
* JBT6K74: NORMAL
* Backlight: on (brightness according to PWM)

==== SYS_POWER_ON_SCRSAVE ====

This is the screen saver mode, if user doesn't interact with LCM for some time (SCRSAVE_TIMEOUT), default 30sec.

* PCF50606: ACTIVE
* S3C2410: SLOW or IDLE
* GSM: Powered up by driving MODEM_ON to HIGH
* GPS: Depending usage / configuration
* Bluetooth : Depending usage / configuration
* JBT6K74: SLEEP
* Backlight: powered off

==== SYS_POWER_SLEEP ====

This is the power saving mode, if user doesn't interact with LCM within SLEEP_TIMEOUT after SYS_POWER_ON_SCRSAVE was entered, default 30sec.

* PCF50606: ACTIVE
* S3C2410: Power_off (this is the suspend-to-RAM state)
* GSM: Powered up by driving MODEM_ON to HIGH
* GPS: TBD
* Bluetooth: Powered down by PMU
* JBT6K74: Deep Standby
* Backlight: powered off

=== Wake-up reasons ===

In the following events, we want the main CPU to be able to be woken up from Power_off (SYS_POWER_SLEEP) state:

==== Events from GSM ====

* Incoming phone call
* Incoming SMS
* Loss of network signal

===== Implementation =====

The GSM daemon configures the GSM Modem in a way to only report the required unsolicited result codes to the UART.  The CPU then needs to wake-up as soon as characters arrive at the UART.

{{note|The S3C2410 cannot resume from Power_off on UART input data. We need to connect either RTS/CTS to EINT, or send some other signals via GSM Modem GPIO to the EINT[0..15] pins of the S3C2410}}

==== Button Press ====

If somebody pushes either the [[Neo1973 Aux Button]] or the [[Neo1973 Power Button]], the system shall wake up

===== Implementation =====

====== Power Button ======
During suspend, the PMU is configured to allow PWRONF events to generate interrupts to the CPU.

{{note|Currently, the PMU IRQ is connected to EINT16, i.e. an interrupt source that cannot wake-up from Power_off mode!}}

====== 911 Button ======
The 911 button is connected to a EINT source that can wake-up the CPU from Poewer_off. 

This means that resuming on 911 button will work out-of-the-box

==== Charger Events ====

If a charger plug (or any other USB device) is connected, the device shall resume and update the battery [charger] status. Also, charger errors such as over/undervoltage, over/under-temperature shall be reported.

===== Implementation =====
During suspend, the PMU is configured to allow EXTONR,CHGERR and related events to generate interrupts to the CPU.

{{note|Currently, the PMU IRQ is connected to EINT16, i.e. an interrupt source that cannot wake-up from Power_off mode!}}

== Kernel API ==

== Userspace API ==

== Approximate power draw of various subsystems ==

The battery has a total of 1200mAh, at 3.6V. This is approximately 3500mWh, once power supply losses are taken into account. The figues below are estimates from datasheets.

These do not take into account the severe hardware bugs of phase 0 hardware, which severely affect power use.

* LCD 
**  200mW with backlight at full brightness
**  40mW with backlight at 10%
***  Based on similar 2.8" LCDs.
* CPU
**  320mW @ 200MHz
**  450mW @ 266MHz
**  140mW @ 200MHz idle.
**  50mW @ 12MHz (slow mode)
*** These include fudge factors for RAM and other systems, from the CPU datasheet.
* Bluetooth
**  63mW @ Tx Burst (file transfer, send)
**  36mW @ Rx Burst (file transfer, receive)
**  3.6mW @ Idle, beacon only
*** Based on the datasheets provided
* GSM ?
*** All GSM terminals have a 2W radio trasmitter so I believe Tx burst consumption will be under that while Rx burst and idle values should be in the 30mW range.
* GPS
** 45mW
*** Based on comparison with a broadly similar (though not as fully featured chip [http://www.maxim-ic.com/appnotes.cfm/an_pk/3447 from Maxim]

USB does not work in slow mode, nor does the LCD screen controller. 
It is not impossible that there may be ways to draw on the screen through the SPI interface, but this has not been confirmed or documented. 
As bluetooth is connected via an internal USB connector, this will not work either.

This would imply that with the CPU constantly on in low power mode, GPS and GSM blipping on and off, and display off, the worst case power consumption is probably around 70mW, leading to a battery life of 2 days.
If the CPU is turned off, battery life rises significantly.

With everything on, playing video with sound, for example should get well over 4 hours.

Both voltage and clock speed to the CPU core can be altered.
Exactly how this will work with the hardware is yet to be determined.
It is possible that it may be capable of playing MP3s with the CPU clock at 60Mhz. This would considerably extend battery life.

== Measured power draw on phase 0 neo1973 ==

I played with old ampermeter, old nokia 3110 (as a powersupply) and phase0 neo1973 a bit. It appears to eat 1.02 mW while powered off, 1.02W while booted (backlight on), ~0.51W while sleeping (with backlight on) and 1.4W while loading applications.
