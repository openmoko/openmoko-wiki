===Variometer===
The variometer signal is simply the derivative of the barometer signal. It gives a much more accurate vertical speed signal than is possible with GPS.This kind of measurement is used by the flee flying community (hanggliding, paragliding, ballooning). A device that allows teams of pilots to share position and speed (with accurate vertical speed) data would be lots of fun.

====Hardware====
It could be best to filter and differentiate the analog pressure signal and then digitize. Another possibility is to differentiate the height in software. A robust solution is to compute a linear regression of a sliding window of height samples. The height samples can be computed using integer arithmetic by a pressure->altitude lookup table followed by interpolation. Maybe it's even possible to add detail based on the accelerometers.

====Hardware solution====
=====Signal Conditioning=====

The absolute pressure signal needs to be:
#Differentiated
#Filtered

*Operational amplifiers in the following configuration:

See the signal conditioning example in this [http://www.freescale.com/files/sensors/doc/app_note/AN1326.pdf Application Note]<br \>
It might be best to use a single chip solution if we can find the right fit e.g.: [http://www.maxim-ic.com/quick_view2.cfm/qv_pk/4590 Max1464]

The software solution can simply be done in the variometer application with some very simple math.

=====A/D=====
We would need two A/D channels:
#Absolute Pressure - 12 bit minimum (assuming a operating range of 0 - 12000 meter 12 bits would give resolution of 2.9304 m)
#Differential Pressure - 10 bit minimum (assuming a range of +-20m/s 10 bits would give a resolution of 0.0391 m/s)

====Driver Code====
The driver code samples the input channels and converts the input values from pressure to altitude:

The relationship between static pressure and pressure altitude is defined in terms of the properties of the International Standard Atmosphere. Up to 36,090 ft this can be expressed as:

<math>
z =\left (1-\left(\frac{P_{ind}}{101.325}\right)^{0.190263} \right ) \times \frac{87.828}{0.00198122}
</math>

Where:

*z = pressure altitude (meter)
*<math>P_{ind}</math> = static pressure (kPa)

These values are provided to listeners in multiple applications.
The sample rate should be application adjustable to conserve power.

====Application code====
Applications can use the altitude data or combine the data with GPS and accelerometer data.
Commonly Kalman filter/observer techniques are used to combine data from multiple sensor types into a robust(with respect to sensor noise), high accuracy estimate of position and speed in 3 axis.

=====Variometer Code=====
Combine measurements as described above.
Apply knowledge about the aircraft dynamics to increase accuracy:
*Total Energy compensation
*Relative Netto Compensation - use accelerometer data to sense when glider is turning in a thermal

'''User Interface'''

*Display speed data in ergonomic manner.
*Display speed for pilots in group.
*Visual and audible guidance to pilot with best climb rate (given reasonable proximity)
*Possible integration with mapping application

====Server Based Services====
Auto discovery service
*Pilots with Openmoko based variometers can choose to publish their status on a central service.
*Based on location - the system will notify pilots of the presence of others that can participate in group flying.
