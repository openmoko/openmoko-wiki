The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A2DP A2DP] bluetooth profile allows high quality audio to be transferred from the phone.

This page describes how to setup A2DP on the Freerunner.

== How to setup A2DP manually ==
This information is mostly taken from [http://lists.openmoko.org/nabble.html#nabble-td2176481 this mail thread]. It has been tested on [[FDOM]] and [[FSO]] milestone 5, but should also work on [[2008.12]].

=== 1. Check installed packages ===
First check that you have the correct package versions installed with {{{opkg list_installed | grep blue}}}. The versions should be these:

 bluez-audio - 3.33-r3
 bluez-utils - 3.33-r3
 bluez-utils-alsa - 3.33-r3
 bluez-utils-compat - 3.33-r3
 libbluetooth2 - 3.33-r0

=== 1.1 Check installed packages (Bluez4) ===
For user with bluez4 (SHR-unstable ecc.) bluez-audio 3.33 and bluez-utils-alsa 3.33 are not compatible with bluez4

 bluez4 - 4.30-r1 
 connman-plugin-bluetooth - 0.10-r0 - 
 kernel-module-bluetooth - 2.6.28-oe1+xxxxx 
 libasound-module-bluez - 4.30-r0 
 libbluetooth2 - 3.33-r0
 
=== 2. Add bluetooth device to /etc/asound.conf ===
Your /etc/asound.conf should contain these:

 pcm.!default {
    type plug
    slave.pcm "dmix"
 }
 
 ctl.mixer0 {
    type hw
    card 0
 }
 
 pcm.bluetooth {
        type bluetooth
        device "XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"
        profile "auto"
 }

XX:XX:XX should be replaced with your device ID.

=== 3. Connect to the device ===
Turn on bluetooth in the GUI and then do

 export DEVICE=XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
 
 /etc/init.d/bluetooth stop
 /etc/init.d/bluetooth start
 
 passkey-agent --default 0000 &
 
 dbus-send --system --type=method_call --print-reply --dest=org.bluez \
   /org/bluez/hci0 org.bluez.Adapter.CreateBonding string:$DEVICE
 
 dbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=org.bluez \
   /org/bluez org.bluez.Manager.ActivateService string:audio
 
 dbus-send --system --type=method_call --print-reply --dest=org.bluez \
   /org/bluez/audio org.bluez.audio.Manager.CreateDevice string:$DEVICE
 
 dbus-send --system --type=method_call --print-reply --dest=org.bluez \
   "/org/bluez/audio/device0" org.bluez.audio.Sink.Connect

If the last step fails, see to it that the device returned in the step before is device0 - otherwise use the other number.

=== 3.1 Connect to the device (Bluez4) ===
Turn on bluetooth in the GUI and then pair with simple-agent (passkey-agent from bluez-utils 3.33 won't work)
simple-agent is included in bluez4 source package (test folder)

 /etc/init.d/bluetooth stop
 /etc/init.d/bluetooth start
 
 python simple-agent hci0 XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
 
Response is something like this :

 RequestPinCode (/org/bluez/XXXX/hci0/dev_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX)
 Enter PIN Code: XXXX
 Release
 New device (/org/bluez/XXXX/hci0/dev_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX)

Now you can start playing, no need to connect manualy.

=== 4. Start playing ===
To play a file with [[mplayer]] use the following command:

 mplayer -ao alsa:device=bluetooth /path/to/file.ogg

== 5. Potential troubles ==
* If you experience problems with choppiness, try changing your hcid.conf to include "lm accept,master;" and "lp hold,sniff,park;"  You may also have to bond (commonly known as 'pairing') your phone and your headset.  See http://wiki.bluez.org/wiki/HOWTO/Bonding for details. [[User:Mercury|Mercury]] 17:36, 5 September 2008 (UTC)

== 6. Devices that work==
* Bluetooth headset BCK-08  (tested on shr unstable from 09 feb) ; very cheap on e-bay (A2DP Stereo Bluetooth Headphone Headset)
* Nokia BH-604 (DJ-style headphones, tested in FDOM and FSO milestone 5)
* B-Speech Calypso (both A2DP and Headset, tested in FDOM)
