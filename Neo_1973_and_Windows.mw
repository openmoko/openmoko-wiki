This page tries to collect some information on how to use your Neo1973 together with a computer running a Microsoft(R) Windows(TM) series operating system.

Please note that this is not really supported, and that the OpenMoko developers themselves only use Linux for testing.

== Connecting to the phone ==

=== USB Ethernet emulation ===
{{note|this has not been tried/verified yet, but is rather only a theoretical description.  Please feel free to correct/extend}}

{{note|it doesn't work for two reasons: phase0 devices have USB Vendor ID and Product ID matching Maemo settings linked below and Windows XP Pro doesn't do communication but ends with "code 10" error after NDIS driver is selected }}

# Download http://people.openmoko.org/laforge/tmp/neo1973_ethernet.inf to somewhere convenient on your Windows machine.
# Connect the Neo1973 USB port to the Windows machine, using a standard USB-A to USB-mini-B cable.
# Assuming the new drivers have been installed as above, Windows should detect the Neo1973 and prompt you for a driver for the USB device. Select to specify your own driver, and then choose the neo1973_ethernet.inf file you downloaded earlier. This file tells Windows XP to use its own built-in RNDIS driver for the device.
# Windows may complain of "reduced network connectivity". This is because it expects to be able to get an address automatically from the Neo1973 and it doesn't provide one in the default setup. To fix this, see the next step.
# Go into the Windows network configuration for the new USB networking adapter and set the IP address of the interface to 192.168.0.200.

You should now be able to connect to your Neo1973 on 192.168.0.202.
