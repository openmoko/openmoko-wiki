This page tries to collect some information on how to use your Neo1973 together with a computer running a Microsoft(R) Windows(TM) series operating system.

Please note that this is not really supported, and that the OpenMoko developers themselves only use Linux for testing.

== Connecting to the phone ==

=== Bluetooth connection ===

How to connect to Windows XP via Bluetooth is described here: [[Manually_using_Bluetooth#Bluetooth_networking_with_a_Windows_XP_system]]


=== USB Ethernet emulation ===
{{note|As of Kernel 2.6.22.5-moko11, USB RNDIS networking ''finally works'' in Windows XP using the procedure described below.}}

# Download http://privat.wmo.de/~c_schweers/NeoRndis.inf to somewhere convenient on your Windows machine.
# Connect the Neo1973 USB port to the Windows machine, using a standard USB-A to USB-mini-B cable.
# Assuming the new drivers have been installed as above, Windows should detect the Neo1973 and prompt you for a driver for the USB device. Select to specify your own driver, and then choose the NeoRndis.inf file you downloaded earlier. This file tells Windows XP to use its own built-in RNDIS driver for the device.
# Windows may complain of "reduced network connectivity". This is because it expects to be able to get an address automatically from the Neo1973 and it doesn't provide one in the default setup. To fix this, see the next step.
# Go into the Windows network configuration for the new USB networking adapter and set the IP address of the interface to 192.168.0.200.

You should now be able to connect to your Neo1973 on 192.168.0.202 via ssh (e.g. putty)


=== Connection to the Internet ===

If you want to connect to the internet from your Neo via Windows XP, e.g. for doing ipkg update/upgrade, you need to set up IP forwarding and routing properly.

==== Option 1, using Windows ICS ====

An easy way to do this is to use Windows Internet Connection Sharing.

To do this, you need to create a network bridge which contains the usb connection to the Neo.

Then you tell Windows to share the WAN connection (i.e. the network interface which connects your Windows system to the internet) with the new bridge.

Then you manually set the IP address of the bridge to 192.168.0.200

After you have done all this, the Neo will be able to route through the Windows machine out to the internet. DNS queries will also be proxied by the Windows machine. Of course, /etc/resolv.conf on the Neo needs to be set to your local DNS or a free DNS.


==== Option 2, using IP Forwarding and extra routing ====

An alternative way is to do it manually:

In the Windows registry, go to:
 Hkey_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters
and set 
 REG_DWORD: "IPEnableRouter" to "1"
Be aware that IP Forwarding can be a security risk.

Then, if there is a router between your Windows XP system and the internet, you also need to tell the router how to get back to your Neo, so you need to set a route on it for 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0 to your Windows XP LAN interface IP address. Windows will then forward the packets to the Neo.
