This page is a repository for alternate case designs for the Neo1973, intended to be designed, built and fitted by the community/the phone's owner.

Each alternate case design suggestion needs some or all of: a description, intended uses, a 3D model in an open format (e.g. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format) .stl], .blend (Blender)), rendered images of the intended design, materials and any information regarding buttons etc. which connect electronically to components within the phone.

== Manufacture ==

There are numerous rapid prototyping companies that will very cheaply make small run components from various polymers, including:

Other materials may require traditional manufacturing techniques, either by the user, or small-run companies such as:

== Design Variant Suggestions ==

Some of these are a copy of requests in [[Wish List - Hardware#Casing]], some are from ideas thrown up in the community mailing list.

===Aesthetic===

* Alternate colours/materials: use the existing or different case shape, but change the colour and material for a unique design.
** Aluminium
*** Anodised
*** Brushed
** Carbon-fibre/epoxy composite
** Inlaid, precision machine-cut calibrated genuine gemstones
** Rubber-feel polymer
** Solid surface materials (e.g. Corian, Avonite)    
** Stainless steel
** Wood

* Removal of free space: there is unnecessary free space within the case - this variant would remove that, possibly with some re-arrangement of components, to make the phone slightly smaller.

* Space efficient lanyard: the lanyard loop at the bottom of the standard case is very large - it could be replaced by a smaller one, reducing the overall phone size.

* Square case: a case with no rounded corners on the top and bottom - may need re-arrangement of GSM/Wi-fi antennae.

* Steampunk: a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk Steampunk] influenced design. See also [http://steampunkworkshop.com Steampunk Workshop].

===Input devices===
* Analogue gaming: a case with an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_stick analogue thumbstick], four face-mounted buttons and four shoulder-mounted buttons.

* Digital gaming: a case with a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-pad digital D-pad], four face-mounted buttons and four shoulder-mounted buttons.

* Gaming docking station: for connection of a gaming controller, such as a PS/Xbox/etc. joypad. The phone would have a mount on the back to allow stable, rigid attachment to a game controller (see picture below).

* Hardware keyboard docking station: to allow mechanical connection to an external USB/Bluetooth-attached keyboard, such as the [http://www.expansys.com/p.aspx?i=124250 Freedom mini Bluetooth keyboard]. The phone would have a mount on the back to allow stable, rigid attachment to the keyboard (either in portrait or landscape orientation), for a similar setup to the game controller above.

* Scroll-wheel(s)

* Side-mounted touch strip sensor: a touch strip attached to the side, as discussed [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2007-June/005931.html here]

* Trackstick: a miniature pointing device, as used on certain IBM laptops

===Layout===
* Different speaker orientation: identical externally to the standard case, but with the speakers mounted one at each end of the phone (on the top), as discussed on the community mailing list. The intention is to give a better stereo spread when listening to stereo-encoded music.

===Increase in existing functionality===

* Alternate screen: the current screen is a 2.8", 640 x 480 colour screen, which some may consider unnecessary and overly power-hungry. This case would allow a smaller, possibly monochrome screen to be fitted, saving battery time. Some may also wish to fit a larger screen - another case variant could allow for that.

* Extra battery: a slightly larger case/re-arranged components may allow for a second battery to be fitted.

* Extra storage: at present, the Neo1973 has 2GB of available storage through a slot for a single microSD card. This could be expanded with a larger case that allowed a second (internal) microSD slot and card, or some other format such as a CF card or 1.8" hard-drive, to be fitted.

===Other functionality addition===
* Ruggedized: a hermetically sealed case; watertight, and able to withstand a pre-defined drop on to a hard surface.

* Stylus mount: there is nowhere on the phone to store a stylus when not in use.

* Tamper-proof: this case would require special tools/processes to open it, or be completely impossible to open without breaking the phone. May also be useful for a cheap hermetically sealed variant.

----

Some users may want combinations of the options listed above.

None of this can be accomplished without the dimensions of existing phones - if FIC are unable/unwilling to release precise dimensions, a user of a Neo1973 will need to measure their phone and upload the information to [[Neo1973 case schematics]] in the form of a CAD drawing/model.
