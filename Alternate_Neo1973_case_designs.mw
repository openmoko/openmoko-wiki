== Design Variant Suggestions ==

Some of these are a copy of requests in [[Wish List - Hardware#Casing]], some are from ideas thrown up in the community mailing list.

===Aesthetic===
* [[Removal of free space]]: there is unnecessary free space within the case - this variant would remove that, possibly with some re-arrangement of components, to make the phone slightly smaller.


* Scroll-wheel(s)


* [[Trackstick]]: a miniature pointing device, as used on certain IBM laptops



===Increase in existing functionality===

* Alternate screen: the current screen is a 2.8", 640 x 480 colour screen, which some may consider unnecessary and overly power-hungry. This case would allow a smaller, possibly monochrome screen to be fitted, saving battery time. Some may also wish to fit a larger screen - another case variant could allow for that.

* [[Extra battery]]: a slightly larger case/re-arranged components may allow for a second battery to be fitted.

* [[Extra storage]]: at present, the Neo1973 has 2GB of available storage through a slot for a single microSD card. This could be expanded with a larger case that allowed a second (internal) microSD slot and card, or some other format such as a CF card or 1.8" hard-drive, to be fitted.

===Other functionality addition===
* [[Ruggedized]]: a hermetically sealed case; watertight, and able to withstand a pre-defined drop on to a hard surface.

* [[Stylus mount]]: there is nowhere on the phone to store a stylus when not in use.

* [[Tamper-proof]]: this case would require special tools/processes to open it, or be completely impossible to open without physically damaging the case. May also be useful for a cheap hermetically sealed variant.

===Notes===
Some users may want combinations of the options listed above.

None of this can be accomplished without the dimensions of existing phones - if FIC are unable/unwilling to release precise dimensions, a user of a Neo1973 will need to measure their phone and upload the information to [[Neo1973 case schematics]] in the form of a CAD drawing/model.
