This page is a repository for alternate case deisgns for the Neo1973.

Each alternate case design suggestion needs: a description, intended uses, a 3D model in an open format (possibly [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format) .stl]), rendered images of the intended design, materials and any information regarding buttons etc. which connect electronically to components within the phone.

Soem of these are a copy of ideas found in [[Wish_List_-_Hardware#Casing]].

* Steampunk: a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk Steampunk]] influenced design

* Digital Gaming: a case with a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-pad digital D-pad]], four face-mounted buttons and four shoulder-mounted buttons.

* Analogue gaming: a case with an [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_stick analogue thumbstick]], four face-mounted buttons and four shoulder-mounted buttons.

* Standard with side-mounted touch strip sensor: the standard case supplied by FIC, with a touch strip as discussed [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2007-June/005931.html here]

* Trackstick: a miniature pointing device, as used on certain IBM laptops
