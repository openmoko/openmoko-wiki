This page is a repository for alternate case designs for the Neo1973, intended to be designed, built and fitted by the community/the phone's owner.

Each alternate case design suggestion needs some or all of: a description, intended uses, a 3D model in an open format (e.g. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format) .stl]), rendered images of the intended design, materials and any information regarding buttons etc. which connect electronically to components within the phone.

== Manufacture ==

There are numerous rapid prototyping companies that will very cheaply make small run components from various polymers, including:

== Design Suggestions ==

Some of these are a copy of requests in [[Wish List - Hardware#Casing]], some are from ideas thrown up in the community mailing list.

* Steampunk: a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk Steampunk] influenced design. See also [http://steampunkworkshop.com Steampunk Workshop].

* Digital gaming: a case with a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-pad digital D-pad], four face-mounted buttons and four shoulder-mounted buttons.

* Analogue gaming: a case with an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_stick analogue thumbstick], four face-mounted buttons and four shoulder-mounted buttons.

* Side-mounted touch strip sensor: a touch strip attached to the side, as discussed [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2007-June/005931.html here]

* Trackstick: a miniature pointing device, as used on certain IBM laptops

* Ruggedized: a hermetically sealed case, watertight, and able to withstand a pre-defined drop on to a hard surface.

* Space efficient lanyard: the lanyard loop at the bottom of the standard case is very large - it could be replaced by a smaller one, reducing the overall phone size.

* Alternate colours/materials: use the existing case shape, but change the colour and material for a unique design.
** Aluminium
** Wood

* Different speaker orientation: identical externally to the standard case, but with the speakers mounted one at each end of the phone (on the top), as discussed on the community mailing list. The intention is to give a better stereo spread when listening to stereo-encoded music.

* Alternate screen: the current screen is a 2.8", 640 x 480 colour screen, which some may consider unnecessary and overly power-hungry. This case would allow a smaller, possibly monochrome screen to be fitted, saving battery time.

* Extra storage: at present, the Neo1973 has 2GB of available storage through a microSD card. This could conceivably be expanded with a larger case that allowed a second microSD card, or some other format such as an 8GB CF card, to be fitted.

* Tamper-proof: opening the case requires special tools/processes, or is completely impossible without breaking it. May also be useful for a cheap hermetically selaed variant.

* Docking station: for connection of other external hardware, such as PS/Xbox/Wii/etc. controller. The controller would have a mount on the back for the Neo1973

Some users may want combinations of the options listed above.

None of this can be accomplished without the dimensions of existing phones - if FIC are unable/unwilling to release precise dimensions, a user of a Neo1973 will need to measure their phone and upload the information to [[Neo1973 case schematics]] in the form of a CAD drawing/model.
