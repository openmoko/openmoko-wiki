This page is a repository for alternate case deisgns for the Neo1973.

Each alternate case design suggestion needs: a description, intended uses, a 3D model in an open format (possibly [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format) .stl]), rendered images of the intended design, materials and any information regarding buttons etc. which connect electronically to components within the phone.

There are numerous rapid prototyping comapnies that will very cheaply make small run components from various polymers, including:

Some of these are a copy of ideas found in [[Wish List - Hardware#Casing]].

* Steampunk: a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk Steampunk]] influenced design

* Digital Gaming: a case with a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-pad digital D-pad]], four face-mounted buttons and four shoulder-mounted buttons.

* Analogue gaming: a case with an [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_stick analogue thumbstick]], four face-mounted buttons and four shoulder-mounted buttons.

* Standard with side-mounted touch strip sensor: the standard case supplied by FIC, with a touch strip as discussed [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2007-June/005931.html here]

* Trackstick: a miniature pointing device, as used on certain IBM laptops

* Ruggedized: a hermetically sealed case, watertight, and able to withstand a pre-defined drop on to a hard surface.

* Space efficient lanyard: the lanyard loop at the bottom of the standard cse is very large - it could be replaced by a smaller one, reducing the overall phone size.

* Alternate colours/materials: use the exisitng case shape, but change the colour and material for a unique design.
