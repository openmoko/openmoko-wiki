== Design Variant Suggestions ==

Some of these are a copy of requests in [[Wish List - Hardware#Casing]], some are from ideas thrown up in the community mailing list.

===Aesthetic===
* [[Removal of free space]]: there is unnecessary free space within the case - this variant would remove that, possibly with some re-arrangement of components, to make the phone slightly smaller.


* Scroll-wheel(s)


* [[Trackstick]]: a miniature pointing device, as used on certain IBM laptops



===Increase in existing functionality===

* Alternate screen: the current screen is a 2.8", 640 x 480 colour screen, which some may consider unnecessary and overly power-hungry. This case would allow a smaller, possibly monochrome screen to be fitted, saving battery time. Some may also wish to fit a larger screen - another case variant could allow for that.



===Notes===
Some users may want combinations of the options listed above.

None of this can be accomplished without the dimensions of existing phones - if FIC are unable/unwilling to release precise dimensions, a user of a Neo1973 will need to measure their phone and upload the information to [[Neo1973 case schematics]] in the form of a CAD drawing/model.
