== Basic Informations ==

Neo FreeRunner uses Evolution data server (eds) to save contacts. 
However, the specific version used differs from what is probably used on your desktop (if you have Evolution installed).

You ''cannot'' copy your addressbook.db from your desktop to Neo ([http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1119 bug 1119]).

== Import and Manage Scripts ==

If you want to import your old contacts to the Neo you could use this script:

[http://www.smurfy.de/files/neo/manage-contacts Manage Contacts script] [http://www.placard.fr.eu.org/~roland/tmp/manage-contacts.py mirror]

If you first want to remove all existing contacts you could use this script.

[http://www.smurfy.de/files/neo/remove_all_contacts remove all script]

If you have all contacts in seperate vcf files and just want to import all at once:

[http://www.smurfy.de/files/neo/ac Simple script]

[http://www.smurfy.de/files/neo/import_contacts Simple script for one big contactsfile]

(please add a .py after the filename, sorry my hoster gives an error if i link to .py files, even .py.txt)

== Exporting old contacts to VCard format ==

To use the manage Script you need your Contacts in VCF format.

# on nokia phones i used the nokia phone manager (long time ago)
# on windows mobile phones you could use active sync to sync with Outlook and then use a Outlook export plugin to export as vcf
# on lg phones the backup function to memory card creates one file with multiple VCards.

== Usage ==

The script is for the 2007.2 Version (default install on Neo FreeRunner), not for Qtopia

You need Python to use this script so do a

 opkg install python-dbus

to install python and the python dbus module

=== Manage Contacts Script ===

'''This script needs all contacts in one big file'''

'''You also could run this script on a ssh session!'''

# Copy your big contacts file (contacts.txt) to your Neo
# Copy script to your Neo
# Connect via ssh to your Neo
# Fix special chars in your contacts file with you favorite text editor
# To import the file run on the SSH shell:

 python manage-contacts.py load < contacts.txt

# For a backup your existing contacts on the Neo

 python manage-contacts.py dump > contacts.txt

=== Simple Script ===

'''You must run the script in the OM Terminal, not over ssh'''

The script does a listdir and imports ALL files it found in that dir. (i'm a bad python programmer)

# Copy all vcf files to a separate directory on my freerunner
# Copy the ac script to the parent directory also on my freerunner
# Have the contacts program running (so you have eds running too)
# Go to the terminal on the freerunner and type in the vcf directory: "python ../ac" (root@om-gta02:~/vcf# python ../ac)
## Note: '''You must call the script in the OM terminal''' not via Bluetooth or USB or you get a dbus error.
# Done :D 

=== Troubleshooting ===
* Make sure you have python and python-dbus installed
* Make sure you have no illegal chars (utf) in the filename and inside the vcf files. (I had problems with Ü,Ä etc)
** The characters seem to work if you convert them from =C3=A4 type of format to proper UTF-8, and the vcards also specify UTF-8 charset. you cannot use other charsets besides UTF-8 since they are delivered via DBus which does not allow others.
* Only vcf files should be in your current directory so do a ../ac.
* You must call the script in the OM terminal not via Bluetooth or USB. If you do so a dbus error occur
