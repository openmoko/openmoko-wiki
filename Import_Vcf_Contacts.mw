If you want to import your old Contacts to your Neo you could use this simple script:

[http://www.smurfy.de/files/neo/ac simple vcf import script]

This Script is for the 2007.2 Version (default install on Neo FreeRunner) not for Qtopia

You need python to use this script do a

 opkg install python-dbus

to install python and the python dbus module

Next step is to export your old contacts as vcf.
I know its possible with Nokia phones and i used a Winmobile->activesync->Outlook export plugin to get my Contacts from my old
Cell.

The script does a listdir and imports ALL files it found in that dir. (i'm a bad python programmer)

so this is what i have done.

* copied all vcf files to a separate directory on my freerunner
* copied the ac script to the parent directory also on my freerunner
* go to the terminal on the freerunner and "typed" in the vcf directory: "python ../ac" (root@om-gta02:~/vcf# python ../ac)
* done :D

Troubleshooting:
* make sure you have python and python-dbus installed
* make sure you have no illegal chars (utf) in the filename and inside the vcf files. (I had problems with Ü,Ä etc)
* only vcf files should be in you current directory so do a ../ac.
* You must call the script in the OM terminal not via Bluetooth or USB. If you do so a dbus error occur


Thanks to [[Import_Sim_Contacts]] for the original Python Script.
