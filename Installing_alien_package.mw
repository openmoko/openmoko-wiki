==Problem==
The problem is that some packages exist in both the fundamental distribution - and other repositories - with same names, but (newer) with other dependencies, other source code includes and other compilation options, which can and often will break the installation.

So e.g. do not use "opkg upgrade" when non-distribution (e.g. non-OM2009) repositories are included. It often breaks the installation.

==Solution hack?==
Please surround the non-distribution (alien) package install with:
# Addition of the required repository
# opkg update # Update database.
# Install the package(s)
# remove the non-distribution repository from opkg. E.g. "rm /etc/opkg/opkg-feed.conf"
# ? Is this required?: opkg update # Update database with only the fundamental distribution packages?

==Future package management system wish==
Wish: Actually the package management system should cope with it. The fundamental distribution with a given version number/revision should have higher precedence, and other repositories should have lesser precedence. Maybe the best would be that the package had a distribution list in which it can be "fundamental".

Maybe the package management system should consult a check post, so an installer can be informed before installation of the package on the given fundamental distribution:
*Not tested
*Tested
** Damage-level:
*** Installation (permanent; system can not (re)boot,...)
*** Non-permanent damage (uninstall recovers the installation):
**** Only configuration
**** Data
*** None
** Feedback:
*** Superficially works
*** Works great
** Designed to work with this fundamental distribution with the version number/revision:
*** Unstable
*** Testing
*** Stable
** ...
