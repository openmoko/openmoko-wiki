While support for many features present in the modified versions of Linux running on most Freerunners still is missing it is verified to [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/openmoko-kernel/2009-November/010696.html boot].

* Thommas Zimmerman wrote a great summary of what is going on in SHR land for those that aren't reading the SHR mailing lists. You can read full thread [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2009-November/057462.html here].

* Matthias Breuel and Michael Tansella did a research project with the openmoko at the KIT (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology) in Germany. They developed a Indoor navigation system with the Freerunner in C++/Qt. You can see a picture from the BNN newspaper [http://www.flickr.com/photos/44512237@N08/4087173946/ here]. They want to thank the great support received from the Openmoko community. Special thanks go to Andy(-tracking) who solved some Acc Kernel troubles over night and Mickey+ (freesmartphone team) whose dbus services did the low level programming for us.

* Michael 'Mickey' Lauer wrote accelerometer plugin for fsodeviced. It will ease getting accelerometers data just by using DBUS. Instructions how to get and use it are [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2009-September/054953.html here]
