This page explains how you can manually re-flash the [[bootloader]] into your Neo1973.  It is basically the manual task of what the [[Devirginator]] tries to do automatically (but not always works).

== Prerequirements ==

* Neo1973 device (any device will work)
* [[Debug Board]] or other device supported by openocd
* lowlevel_foo.bin for your board (e.g. from buildhost)
* u-boot.bin for your board (e.g. from buildhost)
* [[OpenOCD]]
* a host PC system (running Linux is strongly recommended, while other OS's might work, too)

== Steps that you do ==

=== Connections ===


# Connect the debug board upstream USB port to your PC
# Connect the FPC to your debug board
# Connect the FPC to your Neo1973
# Put a charged battery into your Neo1973
# Push the power button of your Neo1973 to swithc it on

=== Starting software ===

# Start OpenOCD (see detailed instructions on [[OpenOCD]] page)
# telnet to port 4444

=== Copy u-boot into RAM and start it ===

So how can we boot from RAM? We use JTAG / OpenOCD to

* Reset and halt the cpu at PC=0
<pre>
> reset halt
target halted in ARM state due to debug request, current mode: Supervisor
cpsr: 0x400000d3 pc: 0x00000000
MMU: disabled, D-Cache: disabled, I-Cache: disabled
</pre>

* Download a small piece of code for low-level SDRAM timing initialization (overwrite 4k SRAM of steppingstone)
<pre>
> load_binary /space/misc/gta01/u-boot.git/board/neo1973/gta01/lowlevel_foo.bin 0            
downloaded 332 byte in 0s 21899us
</pre>

* Assert a break point at address 0x33f80000 (which indicates that the low-level code has finished)
<pre>
> bp 0x33f80000 4 hw
breakpoint added at address 0x33f80000
</pre>

* Run the code up to the break point
<pre>
> resume
Target 0 resumed
> Target 0 halted
target halted in ARM state due to breakpoint, current mode: Supervisor
cpsr: 0x600000d3 pc: 0x33f80000
MMU: disabled, D-Cache: disabled, I-Cache: enabled
</pre>

* Download the u-boot RAM image to 0x33f80000
<pre>
> load_binary /space/misc/gta01/u-boot.git/u-boot.bin 0x33f80000
downloaded 135692 byte in 6s 567264us
</pre>

* Resume processing
<pre>
> resume
Target 0 resumed
</pre>

At this point, the display backlight gets bright and we see the following familiar prompt on the serial console:
<pre>
U-Boot 1.1.6 (Jan 13 2007 - 23:44:23)

DRAM:  128 MB
NAND:  64 MiB
*** Warning - bad CRC or NAND, using default environment

In:    serial
Out:   serial
Err:   serial
Hit any key to stop autoboot:  0 
GTA01Bv2 # 
</pre>

=== copying u-boot into RAM ===

Now you have the full u-boot running from RAM, you can use all its drivers and have various options to transfer data into the Neo, such as a new u-boot image for NAND.  You can use 
* DFU / dfu-utils directly into the partitions such as u-boot, kernel, rootfs
* alternative
*** halt the system from JTAG, and copy data into RAM
*** copy data from microSD using mmcinit/ext2load
** then resume into u-boot and use 'nand write.e'

FIXME: I'll finish after lunch
