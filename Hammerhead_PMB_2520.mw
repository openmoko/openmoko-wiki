* Feature: GPS + AGPS
* Facturer: Global Locate
* Product Homepage: [http://www.globalocate.com/SEMICONDUCTORS/SEMI_HAMMER_Frameset.htm Hammerhead]
* Driver: Implemented as a binary with NMEA output suitable for the gpsd daemon ([[gpsd]])
* Externally-accessible GPS antenna connector of type MMCX

A binary (closed source) driver is available - see [[gllin]]. 
Efforts to reverse engineer the protocol are partially detailed in [[Hammerhead/Protocol]], these have stalled since the announcement that the Neo FreeRunner will use a different GPS.
