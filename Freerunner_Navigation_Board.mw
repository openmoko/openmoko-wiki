=== End user software ===
A Vala-based [http://gitorious.org/sensor-monitor/sensor-monitor sensor monitor] developed by [[User:MicVm]] can be used to visualize the sensor values. The software is very experimental. You are using it at your own risk :)

The monitor has been developed in order to easily add arbitrary sensors as sources. The monitor uses GTK and Cairo for drawing the values and right now is quite slow on the GTA02. We are working on improving the refresh speed. Possibly with the same toolkit.

Except for the above mentioned sensors there have been written plugins for:
* [http://www.st.com/stonline/products/literature/ds/12726/lis302dl.htm LIS302DL] accelerometers (the ones included in our devices)
* BMP085 pressure sensor

This is a screenshot of application monitoring the X and Y gyro-axis of the navigation board as well as the X-axis of the digital compass:
