gllin is an userpsace driver for a hammerhead [[GPS]] chip. It was distributed on phase1 openmokos.

Thanks to a tremendous amount of hard work by many people, we have ready
a release of gllin, the GPS drives. Here is how you can get it:

http://3rdparty.downloads.openmoko.org/gllin/

Instructions, how to use the driver, are given at:

http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2007-November/011916.html. 

The similar instructions are described in more details at [[getting GPS console output with gllin]]. The downloaded .ipk package can be installed and works not just on OpenMoko but also on Qtopia.


== gllin options ==

The /home/root/gllin/gllin file installed by the new (legitimate!) .ipk package is really just a shell script.  You can modify the options passed to gllin.real by editing that script.  Here are the options:
<pre>
Usage:

== Using gpsd with gllin ==

ipkg install gpsd

edit /etc/default/gpsd and set the GPS_DEV to /tmp/nmeaNP start gpsd before gllin.

== Some notes: ==

The listed defaults don't seem to be correct.  By default it DOES generate NMEA data in log files.  These log files are on your flash (/home/root/gllin/log/*) and are written to once every second.  Ridiculous!

To stop this, add the option "-nmea" to the second of the two gllin.real commands in the startup script.

But note further that the startup script also spawns a command to 'cat' the output of the /tmp/nmeaNP named pipe to a gzipped file in /home/root.  If you want this to stop, you can do one of two things:

  * cat to /dev/null instead of | gzip >> file

  * add "-np" to the second gllin.real command

You can't just take the 'cat' command out of the script, because with the named pipe activated, gllin will QUIT if it doesn't see anybody taking the output from the pipe.  To keep it going, either open that pipe or turn it off.

You can use this [http://obri.sygroup.ch/gllin gllin initscript] to start and stop gllin.

Another option:
 #!/bin/sh
 echo "Starting gllin..."
 
 killall cat
 killall gllin.real
 
 mknod /tmp/nmeaNP p
 cat /tmp/nmeaNP > /dev/null &
 cd /home/root/gllin
 lib/ld-linux.so.2 --library-path /home/root/gllin/lib:/home/root/gllin/usr/lib /home/root/gllin/gllin.real -low 5
 lib/ld-linux.so.2 --library-path /home/root/gllin/lib:/home/root/gllin/usr/lib /home/root/gllin/gllin.real -periodic 1 -nmea

== More Initscripts ==

The gllin package doesn't come with a very good set of initscripts, and gpsd is flexible enough to use gllin or some other source of GPS coordinates.

For gpsd and gllin to run together well, upon boot, the following scripts have worked well for me:

/etc/init.d/gpsd:

#

	# for discussion.  Fortunately:
	#
	# 1. gpsd startup can't fail, or at least not in the absence of

	#

	# up -- gpsd does its own syslog calls.

These scripts allow you (or init, if you have them numbered in rcX.d appropriately) to start gpsd *before* gllin.  This way, gpsd starts listening on /tmp/nmeaNP immediately, and gllin doesn't need to send output to /dev/null in order to stay alive.

This version of the gpsd script will create the named pipe (if the device name includes "NP" in the filename) if it doesn't exist.
