gllin is an userpsace driver for a hammerhead [[GPS]] chip. It was distributed on phase1 openmokos.

Thanks to a tremendous amount of hard work by many people, we have ready
a release of gllin, the GPS drives. Here is how you can get it:

Unfortunately, it is an OABI binary, and not even static one, so lots of stuff is needed for it to work. For security reasons, and for compatibility with EABI userland, it is probably best to run it in chroot. [[user:Zdanek|Zdanek's]] wrote an [http://www.openmoko.org.pl/node/55 article] how to put that together.

==The changeroot trick==

Your chroot will need to contain following files:

...and you"ll want to mount /sys there. Then, to get gps to work, do:

root@fic-gta01:/chroot$ cat /chroot/tmp/nmeaNP &<br />
root@fic-gta01:/chroot$ chroot /chroot/ gllin -low 1<br />
root@fic-gta01:/chroot$ chroot /chroot/ gllin -periodic 1<br />

== gllin options ==

The /home/root/gllin file installed by the new (legitimate!) .ipk package is really just a shell script.  You can modify the options passed to gllin.real by editing that script.  Here are the options:

== Using gpsd with gllin ==

edit /etc/default/gpsd and set the GPS_DEV to /tmp/nmeaNP start gllin before gpsd.

== Some notes: ==

The listed defaults don't seem to be correct.  By default it DOES generate NMEA data in log files.  These log files are on your flash (/home/root/gllin/log/*) and are written to once every second.  Ridiculous!

To stop this, add the option "-nmea" to the second of the two gllin.real commands in the startup script.

But note further that the startup script also spawns a command to 'cat' the output of the /tmp/nmeaNP named pipe to a gzipped file in /home/root.  If you want this to stop, you can do one of two things:

  * cat to /dev/null instead of | gzip >> file

  * add "-np" to the second gllin.real command

You can't just take the 'cat' command out of the script, because with the named pipe activated, gllin will QUIT if it doesn't see anybody taking the output from the pipe.  To keep it going, either open that pipe or turn it off.
