Fido is a Canadian GSM provider, using the 1900 MHz band. Fido is now owned by [[Carriers/Rogers|Rogers]] and they offer access to the Rogers network as an "Expanded Network" option on some plans. Note that in some areas the Rogers network uses 850 MHz, and this band appears to be disabled or otherwise non-functional on current Neo1973 handsets.

[[User:Mmontour|mmontour]] 20:58, 2 August 2007 (CEST) - I transferred the SIM from a Fido Prepaid phone into my newly-arrived Neo1973 and was able to send and receive calls. I have not yet tested any other functionality.
