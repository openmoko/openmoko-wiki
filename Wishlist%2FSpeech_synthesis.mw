Openmoko would benefit from a built-in speech synthesis library. [[http://espeak.sourceforge.net/ eSpeak]] looks like a good candidate, and is around 250k (is this big for speech synthesis libs?)

=Applications=

* Speak the caller's name while playing the ringtone. The advantage of knowing who's calling without having to set up custom tones for each phone book entry. This works really well on modern Nokias.
* Auto read sms messages when using a bluetooth headset (ie when driving)
* [[Wishlist:Human screening|human screening]], [[Answering Machine]], or a generic audio menu used by those applications.
* Paste text into phone call.
