==Distributions==
{{DistributionBox|
Name=[[QT Moko]]|
Description=QT moko is debian distribution for Openmoko Freerunner phone. Phone and user interface is based on QT Extendeded formerly known as Qtopia. As for the speed, this image is finally fast and responsive and i think it's very usable. This time I will leave testing on you - hopefully nothing nasty crept in. If you wonder where are V7 images - they do not exist. Credits to everybody who helped with this release. Changes from previous version:
* UI is much faster (by fixing bug with opened accelerators.)
* Bluetooth works again (thanks to Bartłomiej Zimoń)
* Upgraded kernel to latest andy-tracking
* Fixed small font size in X
* Fixed AUX to work again when QX ends up
* Fixed compiling on newer gcc
* Added support of uploading screenshots to scap.linuxtogo.org
* QtMaze - updated to version 1.1 (various fixes, new level added)
* Fixes in package manager
* Howto for building debian based rootfs is now in GIT [1]|

==Community==
* After some deliberation and input from the [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.handhelds.openmoko.community/48620 community] '''Angus Ainslie decided to stop maintaining Om2009 and start work on getting Paroli to co-exist in SHR'''. General instructions on how to run Paroli in SHR are on the  [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Paroli#Paroli_on_SHR_unstable Paroli wiki page].

* There was a poll about the '''[http://doodle.com/sd2c8d8snr23eeqq most popular distribution]''' and '''[http://www.doodle.com/svvsubwnyn4zaxd3 boot loader]''' amongst the people who read the mailing lists, are somehow community-active users, or just answered the poll. Most likely this is not reality amongst all users but shows where the majority of the community-active people are. Polls are still open for voting, thus if you want to show developers what is your favourite distribution, do not hesitate and take a vote for your favourite [http://doodle.com/sd2c8d8snr23eeqq distro] or [http://www.doodle.com/svvsubwnyn4zaxd3 bootloader]! Otherwise your favourite distro might loose contributors! Current results show that 
** the most popular distro is '''SHR''' (over 6 times more users than the Openmoko distributions, followed by Debian Hackable:1 and Android)
** The most popular bootloader is '''QI''' (over 2 times more users than uBoot) 

* '''Qalee''' started new website on http://www.qalee.org/.

* On Apr 20th, IDA Systems had announced buzz fix for Indian customers. Exact date of buzz fix is not known yet... These days there has been some activity regarding the same. Currently, the situation is totally unplanned. Please follow '''[http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2009-September/054310.html this mail]''' to get more information. We think there would be more users of FR that want this fix done in India. Please reply on the mentioned email thread as well(avoid using nabble).

Czech and Slovak community members please help open this newcomers website, information and collaboration place.
