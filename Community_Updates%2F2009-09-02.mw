==Distributions==
{{DistributionBox|
Name=QT Moko|
Description=QT moko is debian distribution for Openmoko Freerunner phone. Phone and user interface is based on QT Extendeded formerly known as Qtopia. As for the speed, this image is finally fast and responsive and i think it's very usable. This time I will leave testing on you - hopefully nothing nasty crept in. If you wonder where are V7 images - they do not exist. Credits to everybody who helped with this release. Changes from previous version:
* UI is much faster (by fixing bug with opened accelerators.)
* Bluetooth works again (thanks to Bartłomiej Zimoń)
* Upgraded kernel to latest andy-tracking
* Fixed small font size in X
* Fixed AUX to work again when QX ends up
* Fixed compiling on newer gcc
* Added support of uploading screenshots to scap.linuxtogo.org
* QtMaze - updated to version 1.1 (various fixes, new level added)
* Fixes in package manager
* Howto for building debian based rootfs is now in GIT [1]|
