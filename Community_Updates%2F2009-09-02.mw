==Distributions==
{{DistributionBox|
Name=QT Moko|
Description=QT moko is debian distribution for Openmoko Freerunner phone. Phone and user interface is based on QT Extendeded formerly known as Qtopia. As for the speed, this image is finally fast and responsive and i think it's very usable. This time I will leave testing on you - hopefully nothing nasty crept in. If you wonder where are V7 images - they do not exist. Credits to everybody who helped with this release. Changes from previous version:
* UI is much faster (by fixing bug with opened accelerators.)
* Bluetooth works again (thanks to Bartłomiej Zimoń)
* Upgraded kernel to latest andy-tracking
* Fixed small font size in X
* Fixed AUX to work again when QX ends up
* Fixed compiling on newer gcc
* Added support of uploading screenshots to scap.linuxtogo.org
* QtMaze - updated to version 1.1 (various fixes, new level added)
* Fixes in package manager
* Howto for building debian based rootfs is now in GIT [1]|

==Community==
* After some deliberation and input from the [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.handhelds.openmoko.community/48620 community] '''Angus Ainslie decided to stop maintaining Om2009 and start work on getting Paroli to co-exist in SHR'''. General instructions on how to run Paroli in SHR are on the  [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Paroli#Paroli_on_SHR_unstable Paroli wiki page].
* '''There was a poll''' about the [http://doodle.com/sd2c8d8snr23eeqq distro people use] and [http://www.doodle.com/svvsubwnyn4zaxd3 what boot loader people use]. '''The most popular distro is SHR''' (over 6 times the users of the Openmoko distributions, followed by Debian Hackable:1 and Android) & bootloader is QI (over 2 times the users of uBoot) amongst the people who read the mailing lists etc and answered the poll. Most likely this is not reality amongst all users but shows where the majority of the community-active people are.
* '''Qalee''' started new website on http://www.qalee.org/.
* IDA Systems had announced buzz fix for Indian customers on Apr 20th. These days there has been some activities regarding the same. Currently, the situation is totally unplanned. Please follow this mail http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2009-September/054310.html to get more idea. We think there would more users of FR that want this fix done in India. Please do reply on the mentioned email thread as well.
* '''Czech Openmoko''' community portal http://www.openmoko.cz is in preparation, suggestions, volunteers and editors are welcome. Czech and Slovak community members please help open this newcomers website, information and collaboration place. Feel free to join to our [http://www.jabber.cz Jabber] [http://www.jabber.cz/wiki/Konference conference] at [http://muc.unart.cz/ ''openmoko@muc.openmoko.cz''].
