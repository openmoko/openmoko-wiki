This is the local user group for organising everyone interested in Openmoko phones in Estonia together. We can also use this page to discuss the distribution of the phones if we decide to buy them en masse.

== Discussion ==
Should we hold the discussion here or on the [[Talk:Openmoko Local Groups: Estonia | talk page]]? [[User:Yogiz|Yogiz]] 08:43, 3 June 2008 (UTC)

I'd prefer the [[Talk:Openmoko Local Groups: Estonia | talk page]], that's why I write here. I don't have a Freerunner yet, waiting for OM2009, anyone interested in collective buying? [[User:Lagle|Lagle]] 16:07, 20 Juuli 2008
