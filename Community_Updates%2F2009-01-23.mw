Hi:

Here is the tenth community update.  
First of all, I will like to thank [[User:MinhHaDuong|Minh]] for contributing so many updates in the past.
Community updates are extremely important to Openmoko; therefore, I will pursue this tradition.

I may not write as well as Minh. So, please give me any feedback/comments that you may have.   
And, if I miss some details, please feel free to complete it to make it better.


==Distribution status update==

[[ZOMG!]]-Fixed one critical bug which could break opkg feeds (don't panic). If this happens it can easily be undone, by hand-checking the feeds you edited (The only way this could have happened to you is if you have edited the feed-title, but not the feed (file)name).
