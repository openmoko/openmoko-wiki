==Introduction==
NeoQplayer is written in Qt4 and try to use a less as possible cpu, removing cpu hungry thinks.
It has only been tested on Debian who provide needed packages ( Qt4 dev librairies, phonon, ... ) but thanks to Qt4 it can be ported easily to others distributions.

* Audio playing throught gstreamer, xine, ... with phonon
* Playlist creation on the fly, show current playlist
* Show cover of current album

==Installing neoqplayer==
NeoQplayer can be installed with provided scripts in the source archive wich download dependencies, compile the code and copy needed files to the right place.

==Using cover functionnality==
You can show cover of the current album, song, artist, ...
For that you need to put a .cover.png file in the folder containing the played song
( There will be an utility to manage your song and covers soon )
