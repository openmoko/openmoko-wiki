==Introduction==
NeoQplayer is written in Qt4 and tries to use as less as possible cpu, removing cpu hungry thinks.
It has only been tested on Debian which provides needed packages ( Qt4 dev librairies, phonon, ... ) but thanks to Qt4 it can be ported easily to other distributions.

==Functionnalities==
* Audio playing throught gstreamer, xine, ... with phonon
* Playlist creation on the fly, show the current playlist
* Show the cover of the current album

==Installing neoqplayer==
NeoQplayer can be installed on debian with provided scripts in the source archive which downloads dependencies, compiles the code and copies needed files to the right place.

==Using cover functionnality==
You can show the cover of the current album, song, artist, ...
For that you need to put a .cover.png file in the folder containing the played song
( There will be a utility to manage your songs and covers soon )
