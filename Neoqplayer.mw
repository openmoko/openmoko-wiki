==Introduction==
NeoQplayer is written in Qt4 and tries to use as less as possible cpu, removing cpu hungry thinks.
It has only been tested on Debian which provides needed packages (Qt4 dev libraries, phonon, ...) but thanks to Qt4 it can be ported easily to other distributions.

==Functionality==
* Audio playing through gstreamer, xine, ... with phonon
* Playlist creation on the fly, show the current playlist
* Show the cover of the current album

==Installing neoqplayer==
NeoQplayer can be installed on Debian with provided scripts in the source archive which downloads dependencies, compiles the code and copies needed files to the right place.

==Using cover functionality==
You can show the cover of the current album, song, artist, ...
For that you need to put a .cover.png file in the folder containing the played song
( There will be a utility to manage your songs and covers soon )
