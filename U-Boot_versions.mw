Bootloader versions are a bit tricky. Here we have a collection of tested [[bootloader]]s and associated bugs.

== Identifying version for a u-boot.bin image ==

The following command should tell you which version of a bootloader is contained in a particular image :

$ strings gta02v5_and_up-u-boot.bin  | grep U-Boot

== Identifying current boot-loader version ==

The version is displayed on top of the booloader's menu.

Being connected to it, the ''version'' command can also be used.

You can also check current boot-loader version from running openmoko system. See : [[Flashing_the_Neo_FreeRunner#Verifying_boot-loader_version]] (whose instructions may be more appropriate here ?)

== Installing another bootloader version ==

See [[Flashing_the_Neo_FreeRunner#Flashing_the_boot_loader_to_the_NAND]] for instance.

== Bugs ==

=== Hang on boot ===

[http://bugzilla.openmoko.org/cgi-bin/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=887 Bug #887: U-Boot initialization race condition: Hangs on boot]

Booting directly makes the kernel oops, but booting via the menu works.

=== ttyACM0 flowcontrol ===

Bug #? ([http://bugzilla.openmoko.org/cgi-bin/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1005#c4 Comment 4 here?])

In the USB u-boot console, fast input seems to work but fast output is buggy: for example, random parts of printenv go missing.

=== Boot from SD===

[http://bugzilla.openmoko.org/cgi-bin/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=799 Bug #799: data abort while reading from SD Cards]

Booting from SD fails. mmcinit works but trying to access the filesystem causes a crash.
