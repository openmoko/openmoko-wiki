=== CALYPSO ASIC digital baseband ===
* Feature: GSM/GPRS modem
* PM Driver: https://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/src/target/kernel/patches/gta01-power_control.patch

Unfortunately we cannot provide many details on the GSM chipset due to very tight [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement NDA]s.  However, this is not neccessarily required, since it interfaces using a standard UART serial line with the [[Samsung S3C2442B B54]] or [[Samsung S3C2410]].  On that interface, [http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/07_series/07.05/ GSM 07.05], [http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/07_series/07.10/ GSM 07.10] and other standardized protocols are used.

The NDAd documentation for the calypso, [http://cryptome.org/ti-calypso1.pdf register definition ] and [http://cryptome.org/ti-calypso2.pdf hardware definition ] was leaked onto a public forum on the 4th of March by persons or persons unknown.
