The collection of information useful for biking with a Neo

== Secure it to the bike ==

André Gaul documented a complete mounting kit [http://andre.web-yard.de/blog/2008/08/03/neo-freerunner-rocks-hard-rides-free/]

It's just a prototype :) but with some foam around the handlebar and careful positioning to avoid bumps, a basic attachment like this might work [http://www.xmission.com/~bmidgley/neobike.jpg] and makes it easy to "pinch" the screen when you need to finger tap something.

== Power Supply ==
=== Crank up the charge ===

If you want to keep the GPS running and have the screen always on or staying on with a long timeout, you'll need a way to supplement power.

If you decide to try solar, it's recommended to get a flexible panel and attach it to your backback or something like that. One nice advantage here is it might also charge even when you're not moving. It's unlikely anything below 7 watts will keep things running. (5v * 1A = 5W).

The alternative is to steal energy from the crank. You can do this with a hub dynamo. It might work with an dynamo outside the hub like the one on the reelight [http://www.reelight.com]--it looks like their coil produces only 3vAC so it makes sense to use a custom coil.

=== Charging via hub ===
Connecting a hub ("Nabendynamo" [http://nabendynamo.de/]) like the SON [http://www.peterwhitecycles.com/schmidt.asp] to a self-made or prebuilt charger could supply your device while biking.

The FreeRunner has three different [[Forcing_fast_charge_mode|charging modes]]: 100mA, 500mA and 1A. 100mA seems to be too low, as it is said, that the FreeRunner draws 100mA current even when it is switched off. A hub dynamo provides 500mA. If you want to use your lights while charging you need to connect the lights in series to the charger. At least the SON will increase the voltage and still delivers the same current. But you need a bypass circuit in case of less current draw of the charger when the battery is full.

== Heart Rate Monitor ==

According to [http://www.mail-archive.com/community@lists.openmoko.org/msg11248.html mailing list discussions] some heart rate monitors use [http://thisisant.com/index.php?section=5 ANT]. Due to the modern chip cases building a reliable homemade receiver seems to be difficult.
