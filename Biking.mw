The collection of information useful for biking with a Neo

== Secure it to the bike ==

Andr√© Gaul documented a complete mounting kit [http://andre.web-yard.de/blog/2008/08/03/neo-freerunner-rocks-hard-rides-free/]

It's just a prototype :) but with some foam around the handlebar and careful positioning to avoid bumps, a basic attachment like this might work [http://www.xmission.com/~bmidgley/neobike.jpg]

== Crank up the charge ==

If you want to keep the GPS running and have the screen on or with a long timeout, you'll need a way to supplement power on a long trip.

If you decide to try solar, it's recommended to get a flexible panel and attach it to your backback or something like that. It's unlikely anything below 10 watts will keep things running. (todo: add some data points)

The alternative is to steal energy from the crank. You can do this with a hub dynamo or possibly with an induction generator like the one on the reelight [http://www.reelight.com] (warning... overuse of flash)

The regulator will have to be a do-it-yourself project regardless of the power source. See [http://www.iki.fi/~msmakela/electronics/dynamo5v/] for one approach. If you do want to try a switching regulator, there's a nice little pre-built module in the form factor of a linear regulator: [http://www.dimensionengineering.com/DE-SW050.htm]
