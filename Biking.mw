The collection of information useful for biking with a Neo.

== Bike Mounts ==
[[Image:Openmoko_mtb_01.jpg|thumb]]
* Andr√© Gaul [http://andre.web-yard.de/blog/2008/08/03/neo-freerunner-rocks-hard-rides-free/ documented a complete mounting kit]
* It's just a prototype :) but with some foam around the handlebar and careful positioning to avoid bumps, a [http://www.xmission.com/~bmidgley/neobike.jpg basic attachment] like this might work and makes it easy to "pinch" the screen when you need to finger tap something. [http://blogs.thehumanjourney.net/finds/entry/20080306 Something similar].
* Another mount: [http://comiles.eu/~natanael/wordpress/2008/09/10/fahrradhalterung-fur-den-freerunner/ Description/Parts list (in German)] and [http://comiles.eu/~natanael/wordpress/2008/09/10/bilder-vom-fahrrad-freerunner/ Pictures]
* And [http://blog.printf.net/articles/2008/08/11/an-openmoko-bike-ride another one] "which I don't recommend very highly; I've had the phone come off it (without major damage, which is good) twice now while riding over rough road."
* Thomas' one (also on the picture right): [http://thomasgruebler.dyndns.org/wordpress/?p=306 fully useable for driving downhill :D]
* Nytowl's mount [[Image:bike_mount_small.JPG|thumb]] [http://handheldshell.com/built/bike_mount.php below right] Never had the phone come out of the mount before.

== Power Supply ==
If you want to keep the GPS running and have the screen always on or staying on with a long timeout, you'll need a way to supplement power.

=== Charging via hub ===
Connecting a hub ([http://nabendynamo.de/ Nabendynamo]) like the [http://www.peterwhitecycles.com/schmidt.asp SON] to a self-made or prebuilt charger can supply your device while biking.

The FreeRunner has three different [[Forcing_fast_charge_mode|charging modes]]: 100mA, 500mA and 1A. 100mA seems to be too low, as it is said, that the FreeRunner draws 100mA current even when it is switched off. A hub dynamo provides 500mA. If you want to use your lights while charging you need to connect the lights in series to the charger. At least the SON will increase the voltage and still delivers the same current. But you need a bypass circuit in case of less current draw of the charger when the battery is full.

Using an USB connection with that ID resistor for 1A mode provides the advantages that the charging mode is automatically correct.
This might be important if you stop frequently and so cause some kind of power "disconnect" and you do not want
to select the charge mode all the time. 1A mode does not harm the hub dynamo but if the dynamo can provide the 500mA also
at higher voltages, you can gain more charge current than in 500mA mode if you have a switching regulator.
For example if the dynamo would provide 10V 500mA and you would have a 100% efficient regulator,
you would have 5V 1A.

==== Commercial Chargers ====

* [http://www.jawetec.de/index.php?content=bikecharger&framing=radsport JaWeTec Bike Charger]
* There is a prototype of a hub featuring built-in USB-out which will hopefully be ready for mass market soon.
* The [http://www.ikonglobal.com/ ''Pedal & Power''] rim dynamo supplies 12 V and may be useful with an appropriate 12 V to USB adaptor, like [http://www.maplin.co.uk/Module.aspx?ModuleNo=228257&doy=9m3&C=SO&U=strat15 Maplin's A23JH]

==== self-made chargers ====
* [http://www.heise.de/kiosk/archiv/ct/07/23/190 Article (German) in c't 23/2007, page 190]
* maybe 6V [http://www.forumslader.de/6V-Version-des-Rad-Forum-Ladegeraets.125.0.html Forumslader] (You need at least one diode in series to be within the maximum ratings of the power managment IC and the FET switches in FreeRunner.)
Will fry FR nevertheless, as FR might stop to take up any current and then the 6V still creep thru the diode.(jOERG)
* [http://forumslader.de/12V-Version-mit-zusaetzlichem-USB.209.0.html Forumslader 12V+USB] works perfectly, maybe you could use it as a (powered) gender changer for other USB devices
* [http://www.iki.fi/~msmakela/electronics/dynamo5v/ Makela]

Linear regulator above might be replaced by [http://www.dimensionengineering.com/DE-SW050.htm DE-SW050].

=== Alternatives ===
If you decide to try solar, it's recommended to get a flexible panel and attach it to your backpack or something like that. One nice advantage here is it might also charge even when you're not moving. It's unlikely anything below 7 watts will keep things running. (5v * 1A = 5W).

It might work with an dynamo outside the hub like the one on the [http://www.reelight.com reelight], but it looks like their coil produces only 3vAC so it makes sense to use a custom coil.

An extra battery like [http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.3060 Rechargeable USB Emergency Power Backup Pack 2400mAh $14.43] can also be useful for extending battery life-time.

== Heart Rate Monitor ==

According to [http://www.mail-archive.com/community@lists.openmoko.org/msg11248.html mailing list discussions] some heart rate monitors use [http://thisisant.com/index.php?section=5 ANT]. Due to the modern chip cases building a reliable homemade receiver seems to be difficult.
