The collection of information useful for biking with a Neo.

== Bike Mounts ==

* Andr√© Gaul documented a complete mounting kit [http://andre.web-yard.de/blog/2008/08/03/neo-freerunner-rocks-hard-rides-free/]
* It's just a prototype :) but with some foam around the handlebar and careful positioning to avoid bumps, a basic attachment like this might work [http://www.xmission.com/~bmidgley/neobike.jpg] and makes it easy to "pinch" the screen when you need to finger tap something.
* [http://www.rabenfrost.net/openmoko/bikemount/ Images of an interesting bike mount]
* Another mount: [http://comiles.eu/~natanael/wordpress/2008/09/10/fahrradhalterung-fur-den-freerunner/ Description/Parts list (in German)] and [http://comiles.eu/~natanael/wordpress/2008/09/10/bilder-vom-fahrrad-freerunner/ Pictures]
* And another one [http://blog.printf.net/articles/2008/08/11/an-openmoko-bike-ride] "which I don't recommend very highly; I've had the phone come off it (without major damage, which is good) twice now while riding over rough road."

== Power Supply ==
If you want to keep the GPS running and have the screen always on or staying on with a long timeout, you'll need a way to supplement power.

=== Charging via hub ===
Connecting a hub ("Nabendynamo" [http://nabendynamo.de/]) like the SON [http://www.peterwhitecycles.com/schmidt.asp] to a self-made or prebuilt charger could supply your device while biking.

The FreeRunner has three different [[Forcing_fast_charge_mode|charging modes]]: 100mA, 500mA and 1A. 100mA seems to be too low, as it is said, that the FreeRunner draws 100mA current even when it is switched off. A hub dynamo provides 500mA. If you want to use your lights while charging you need to connect the lights in series to the charger. At least the SON will increase the voltage and still delivers the same current. But you need a bypass circuit in case of less current draw of the charger when the battery is full.

==== self-made chargers ====
* [http://www.heise.de/kiosk/archiv/ct/07/23/190 Article (German) in c't 23/2007, page 190]
* maybe 6V [http://www.forumslader.de/6V-Version-des-Rad-Forum-Ladegeraets.125.0.html Forumslader] (You need at least one diode in series to be within the maximum ratings of the power managment IC and the FET switches in FreeRunner.)
* Makela [http://www.iki.fi/~msmakela/electronics/dynamo5v/]

Linear regulator above might be replaced with [http://www.dimensionengineering.com/DE-SW050.htm]

There is a prototype of a hub with built-in USB-out which will hopefully be ready for mass market soon.


=== Alternatives ===
If you decide to try solar, it's recommended to get a flexible panel and attach it to your backpack or something like that. One nice advantage here is it might also charge even when you're not moving. It's unlikely anything below 7 watts will keep things running. (5v * 1A = 5W).

It might work with an dynamo outside the hub like the one on the reelight [http://www.reelight.com], but it looks like their coil produces only 3vAC so it makes sense to use a custom coil.


== Software for biking ==

* [[TangoGPS]], + [http://blogs.thehumanjourney.net/finds/entry/20080826 OSM Cycle data]
* [[Navit]]
* [http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Rana Rana] uses [[Installing Pyroute|Pyroute]]
* [http://www.neo1973-germany.de/wiki/pylgrim pylgrim] bitmap map viewer. Dead.

== Heart Rate Monitor ==

According to [http://www.mail-archive.com/community@lists.openmoko.org/msg11248.html mailing list discussions] some heart rate monitors use [http://thisisant.com/index.php?section=5 ANT]. Due to the modern chip cases building a reliable homemade receiver seems to be difficult.
