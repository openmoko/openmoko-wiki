===Copy and Execute Script===
Copy and paste the code into an editor of your choice (KDE kwrite or vi), save the file to <tt>SHRpostinstallation.sh</tt> and upload the file to your freerunner. Execute the shell script on you freerunner:
  desktop#
  scp c root@192.168.0.202/home/root/SHRpostinstallation.sh   
Start the shell script on you Freerunner with:
  neo# sh /home/root/SHRpostinstallation.sh
If you want to replace <tt>dropbear</tt> by <tt>openssh</tt> you have to start the script from the terminal on your FR and not via SSH, because the installation restarts the SSH daemon and the script will stop, if you start the script via SSH on your Freerunner from your desktop computer.
