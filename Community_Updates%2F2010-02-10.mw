{{DistributionBox|
Name=[[QtMoko]]|
Description=QtMoko is a Debian-based distribution for the Openmoko Freerunner phone. Phone and user interface are based on QT Extended, formerly known as Qtopia. Currently QtMoko is provided with two kernels - one vanilla andy-tracking with debugging stuff and one with stripped config. The first one is slow but stable. The second one is fast, but it can have problems with switching to QVGA (WSOD) and sometimes wifi does not work (Suspend/resume can fix it). You can decide which one you want to use. Just flash your favorite kernel (for jffs image) or change the symlink in /boot (for SD card image). There is a dirty hack for displaying undelivered SMS - you have to restart Qtopia. As for the changes - credits go to Jeroen for fixing bugs and Esteban for translations, thanks a lot! Changes from previous version:
* Spanish translation (Esteban Monge)
* Fixed compiling on systems with QT 4.6
* Fixed freeze while removing wifi-settings (Jeroen Nijhof)
* Fixed bing fonts in SMS email and others (Jeroen Nijhof)
* Fixed saving suspend interval in power management (Jeroen Nijhof)
* NeronGPS and Arora in default installation
* Removed some demos and not working apps
* QX now suspends on call or when SMS arrives
* Workaround for incoming SMS bug
* Two kernels. Slow with debug, fast with nodebug
* Fixed web browser crashes
* Downgrade to QT 4.5.3|
