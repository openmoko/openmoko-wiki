FIXME: Some first steps guide for our phase-0 recipients.

The software install I have on a phone right now is several months old -- until I upgrade it, these instructions might not all be relevant.

Just hitting the power button should get the phone booted and running X/GPE.  From this point, there are a few ways to hack on the phone:

== By using the terminal emulator and on-screen keyboard ==

"Click" (using a stylus) the top-left arrow icon to get a drop-down menu with "Media", "Settings", "Utilities" and "Desktop".  Choose "Utilities->Panel->Input Manager", and a keyboard icon will appear on the top bar.  You can get an on-screen keyboard at any time by choosing it.

From the desktop, choose "Active tasks->rxvt" to get a root shell.

== By using ethernet over a USB cable ==

You can run `ifconfig` in the terminal to see which IP the phone has taken.  If you plug a USB cable into a laptop running Linux, you'll likely see the "cdc_ether" kernel module being loaded and a usb0 network interface appear.  The IP the phone I have was set to use is 192.168.2.2; on my Linux machine, I did:

   ifconfig usb0 192.168.2.2 netmask 255.255.255.0   
   ssh root@192.168.2.2
   <hit enter when asked for a password> 

You should now have a root login.

== By using the debug board/serial/JTAG ==

I don't have a debug board yet; this will be added later.
