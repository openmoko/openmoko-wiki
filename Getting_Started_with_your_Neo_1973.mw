Some first steps guide for those who have just received their first Neo1973 hardware

Just hitting the power button (depending on your [[u-boot]] version you have to press for >= 5 seconds) should get the phone first into the bootloader, then boot the kernel, and get into  X/GPE.  

From this point, there are a few ways to hack on the phone:

== By using the terminal emulator and on-screen keyboard ==

"Click" (using a stylus) the top-left arrow icon to get a drop-down menu with "Media", "Settings", "Utilities" and "Desktop".  Choose "Utilities->Panel->Input Manager", and a keyboard icon will appear on the top bar.  You can get an on-screen keyboard at any time by choosing it.

From the desktop, choose "Active tasks->rxvt" to get a root shell.

== By using Ethernet emulation over a USB cable ==

The standard Neo1973 Linux [[kernel]] has support for the "cdc_ether USB gadget", i.e. a standard implementation of how to emulate an Ethernet device over USB.

As soon as the kernel is up and running, and you have the phone connected via USB, you should get a '''usb0''' device on your host.  

The Phone will have the IPv4 address 192.168.0.202/24.  You can run `ifconfig` in the terminal on the phone to verify this (this is optional, just check it if it doesn't work given the instructions below)

If you plug a USB cable into a laptop running Linux, you'll likely see the "cdc_ether" kernel module being loaded and a usb0 network interface appear.  

On the '''host PC''', you should then configure your interface to 192.168.0.200 by using
 # ifconfig usb0 192.168.0.200 netmask 255.255.255.0

Then you should be able to
 # ping 192.168.0.202

and last, but not least
 # ssh root@192.168.0.202

Once you press 'enter' (empty password), you should now have a root login.

== By using the debug board/serial/JTAG ==

TBD.
