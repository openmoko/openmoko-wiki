** a FAST high contrast theme package consisting of an enlightenment (illume) theme, elementary theme, etk theme, libframeworkd-phonegui-efl theme and an icon theme. (the opkg.org feed doesn't seem to be updated correctly so the themes have to be installed one by one)

* '''[http://www.openzim.org/ ZIMreader]''' - openZIM project, a free and open source implementation of the ZIM file format.

The openZIM project is sponsored by [http://www.wikimedia.ch/ Wikimedia CH]. The ZIMreader provided by openZIM is just an example application, free to use and open source. It has been developed under the name "tntzenoreader" in 2007 by Tommi Mäkitalo, the developer of tntnet (and now lead developer of openZIM), to be used on the german Wikipedia DVD. Marc Bantle has prepared ZIMreader binaries for Freerunner users. Tarball is available [http://www.gut-informierte-kreise.de/openmoko/openzim/ here]

* '''[http://pvtrace.com/literki_0.0.2-r3_armv4t.ipk Literki 0.0.2-r3]''' This is a new version of your favorite keyboard. The mechanism for showing/hiding the keyboard has changed, now you show/hide Literki by sliding bottom right corner with your finger. You can configure what distance you need to slide. If you just click the bottom right corner, the click goes through to the application, so it (almost) doesn't affect using other applications when the keyboard is hidden. This update is concentrated on using libfreetype for fonts. Screenshot is available [http://pvtrace.com/literki2.png here]. Literki configuration file explanation is [http://pvtrace.com/literki_conf.html here]. Openmoko users will need [http://shr.bearstech.com/shr-unstable/ipk/armv4t/libfakekey0_0.2+svnr1455-r1_armv4t.ipk libfakekey] as a dependency. Main changes are:
** it supports Unicode input. Tested only with Polish diacritic signs.
** it looks much nicer
** the keys are much more visible when transparent, thus transparency is on by default
** you can change the font and size

* The University of São Paulo's '''[http://lists.openmoko.org/nabble.html#nabble-f1958 intends to join]''' Openmoko development.

* Ben Wilson wrote a '''[http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Unbricking_the_Neo1973_(GTA01)_without_a_debugboard wiki]''' page for the un-bricking GTA01 using a simple LPT -> JTAG  circuit. It may also work for doing some actual debugging and should be pretty easy to wire up to gta02 as well.

* David Lanzendörfer has managed to boot Openmoko on the HTC-Dream with framebuffer console. That means: Android Linux kernel + Openmoko (Angstrom) user space. If someone is interested in participating the development, you're welcome to help.
