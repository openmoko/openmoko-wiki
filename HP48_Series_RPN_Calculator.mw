[[Image:HP48OnMoko.png|neo1973 emulating a HP 48GX calculator]]

Eddie C. Dost and IÃ±igo Serna Robledo wrote
an open-source emulator for the HP 48 series of RPN calculators.   This code can be used with
a ROM image of the code from a specific
HP 48 series calculator, to provide a
working calculator.   The emulator is not
fast by any means - running on a neo1973,
the emulator is only about 70% faster than
an HP 48G.   It is definately usable -
it is faster than the real calculator after all.

Their original source code,
available at http://www.hpcalc.org/hp48/pc/emulators/
will build on standard unix/linux
distributions, and displays using the GTK+
toolkit and X11.   There are only three things
that prevent their original code from being
directly usable on an Openmoko phone.
First, the image of the calculator the
code produces is too large for a VGA
display, and the bottom ~3 rows of
keys are not displayed.   That was
fixed by removing some of the protions
of the display which were merely
cosmetic (showing the HP logo and model
number, for example). Secondly,
the source code package is not designed
for crosscompilation, which is what
is usually done for Openmoko code. Thirdly,
the default fonts the code uses aren't
present in the Openmoko rootfs (at least
the 2007.2 family of releases), so they
needed to be changed.

Your going to need extremely fine finger
control to run this thing without a stylus.
I think in practice this device must be
considered stylus-based.

Like many programs, the command line options
can be seen by executing the program with
the argument --help.   The most important
command line options are -rom, which
must be followed by the rom file name
(with path, if not in the current directory)
and -home, which must be followed by the
directory into which the program should store
the RAM image.

The emulation of the calculator is exact enough that the calculator will turn itself off after being idle for a few minutes.
For some reason, you must press the ON key
several times to turn the calculator back on.
I will try to fix that bug.

I have done the little changes to the
code required to make the calculator image
fit on a VGA display, as shown above, and
I have gotten the code to crosscompile.

The emulator reproduces the real calculator's
power saving feature of turning off after
a few minutes with no activity.   When
the calculator is off, the screen will be
blank.   To turn it back on, tap the on
key twice in rapid succession.

The modified code and/or an opkg package may

==Installation==
Login with ssh to your Free Runner or use a terminal to install the emulator with the following command (check the URL):
<pre>
opkg install http://projects.openmoko.org/frs/download.php/301/mokox48_1.0_arm_2008.8.ipk
</pre>

Click on the new mokox48 icon in your home (I use the FSO-distribution at the moment) and the calculator starts.

I don't know why a x48 in the terminal didn't work.

A ROM from your HP 48 calculator is '''not''' needed.
You can download it for free since 2000 [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-48#cite_ref-0], [http://hp.giesselink.com/emu48faq.htm#ROM] for example from:
[http://www.hpcalc.org/hp48/pc/emulators/gxrom-r.zip http://www.hpcalc.org/hp48/pc/emulators/gxrom-r.zip]
<pre>
wget http://www.hpcalc.org/hp48/pc/emulators/gxrom-r.zip
unzip gxrom-r.zip
rm gxrom-r.zip
</pre>

There is a hint [http://www.mustun.ch/michael/dokumente/x48/x48.html] to copy the ROM in the same directory as the binary:
<pre>
mv ./gxrom-r /usr/bin/rom.dump
</pre>
