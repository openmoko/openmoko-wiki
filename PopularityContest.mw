Here's one I made earlier...

===About===

I think it would be good for the community to have some idea of the install base for applications. So I wrote a very quick and dirty way for people to submit their installed package list.

Announcement email http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2010-April/061231.html

see also http://popcon.debian.org/

===Installation===
Try it with the following (will clobber anything called pop in /usr/bin):

 wget http://www.timwise.co.uk/om/pop/pop.tar.gz
 tar -C / -xzvf pop.tar.gz

===submitting your package list===
then submit your package list with

 /usr/bin/pop

===collected data===
You can view submissions at
http://www.timwise.co.uk/om/pop/submissions/

First analysed data (only 5 sumbissions so far):
http://www.timwise.co.uk/om/pop/summary20100410.txt


===code===
The code is at http://github.com/timabell/popularity
improvements would be welcome, as would inclusion in the various distros.
Perhaps if it works out this could be hosted by the various distro servers.


===Todo===

* uniqueid for machine / install / user (optional)
* automated submissions (connectivity detection)
* automated analysis
* inclusion in shr feeds
* prompt whether to participate when shr first run
* move data collection to official server
