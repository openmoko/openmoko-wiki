Here's one I made earlier...


I think it would be good for the community to have some idea of the install base for applications. So I wrote a very quick and dirty way for people to submit their installed package list.

Try it with the following (will clobber anything called pop in /usr/bin):

wget http://www.timwise.co.uk/om/pop/pop.tar.gz
tar -C / pop.tar.gz

then submit your package list with

/usr/bin/pop

You can view submissions at
http://www.timwise.co.uk/om/pop/submissions/


The code is at http://github.com/timabell/popularity
improvements would be welcome, as would inclusion in the various distros.
Perhaps if it works out this could be hosted by the various distro servers.

First analysed data (only 5 sumbissions so far):

===Todo===

* uniqueid for machine / install / user (optional)
* automated submissions (connectivity detection)
* automated analysis
* inclusion in shr feeds
* prompt whether to participate when shr first run
* move data collection to official server
