==Installation==
{{Note|If you have the 0.1 version of both game and library installed on your phone, please remove it first:

	opkg remove allegro-4.2.2

	opkg remove liquidwar-5.6.4

	rm ~/.liquidwarrc

}}

The game requires the Allegro library to run, so you have to download and install it first. After this is done, download and install the game package itself.

===Download===

 wget http://mojo.org.ua/moka/allegro_4.2.2-1_armv4t.ipk
 wget http://mojo.org.ua/moka/liquidwar_5.6.4-2_armv4t.ipk

===Install ===

 opkg install allegro_4.2.2-1_armv4t.ipk
 opkg install liquidwar_5.6.4-2_armv4t.ipk

Now, if you've done everything right, the game icon should appear on your Neo desktop.

==Playing==
To find out what is this game about and how to play it, please see the documentation at the original game homepage.
Openmoko-specific changes are the following:

* There are two video-modes currently supported: 480x640 (default - for portrait mode), and 640x480 (landscape). Currently, the game itself will not try to rotate the screen, so if you want to play in the lanscape mode, yo have to use xrandr or similar software to set your preferred screen orientation. The game and menu video-modes are controlled from Main menu/Options/Graphics configuration dialog.
* Mouse is the default control device for a human player. You set the cursor movement vector by moving your stylus/finger in the direction you want cursor to move.
* Minor graphics display adjustments.
* More to come in the next versions... If you have any good ideas on making the game better, just drop me a note. 

==Known Issues==

* Right after installation the Liquid War icon appears to be blank. Restarting window manager solves the problem. Is something wrong with the package?
* Sometimes when video mode is changed from the Graphics dialog, the program window is not closed automatically when the process is terminated.
* If you set different video-modes for the menu and game display, Liquid War may freeze when starting to play. When you switch to the different window and back, everything continues normally. Both this and previous problem seem to have the same origin.
