A mobile photo frame (MPF) is a simple-to-operate device dedicated to displaying photos which are automatically downloaded via the mobile network.

== Business Models ==

* '''Hardware sale''': at $299 per unit, the MPF is a link to all your memories for viewing on-the-road. The price may be subsidized by the mobile operator with a high data volume contract.

* '''Photo printer sponsored''': friends on your allow-list can push photos to you wirelessly. With a touch of the on-screen button, the photo is printed at the sponsoring photo shop and postal mailed to your home.

* '''Advertising sponsored''': based on metadata stored in the received/viewed photos, appropriate advertisement are selected to recommend related tours, dining experience, holiday getaway packages, etc.
