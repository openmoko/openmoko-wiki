Initial indexing should be carried out on a desktop/laptop, as the freerunner is not powerful enough

{{application|offline wikipedia}}

This project provides software to store the entirety of Wikipedia (any language) locally on a Linux device.

All Wikipedia pages are downloaded from the Wikipedia page dump - [http://download.wikimedia.org/enwiki/20081008/]. The files needed is called 'pages-articles.xml.bz2', and the most recent is 4.1GB

The English Wikipedia (text only) is around 6GB including indices, so the entire content can be stored on one 8GB card. The German Wikipedia is approximately 1/4 the size, so can be stored on a correspondingly smaller card; ditto for other languages.

The software functions by running a lightweight webserver on the phone, and using php to present the pages, which are then viewed using any web browser.

=Development status=

At present, a single tar.bz is downloaded from the site above, the pages extract downloaded and copied to the correct location, and the indexing process run (takes approximately one hour on a dual-core 1.1GHz cpu, 1.5GB RAM laptop). Dependencies (php, perl ,python) are then installed on the freerunner, and the index and database copied to the freerunner, along with the web server.

In the future the software will be released as an ipk. Also a deb/rpm for a desktop distributions, to allow automatic download of the most recent wikipedia dump, with a diff utility to allow it to be updated and re-indexed.
