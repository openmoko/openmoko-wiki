QMapControl is a "Qt Extended" (Qtopia) widget which enables your mobile applications to use map data. Simply add the widget to your application, have a look at the API and start developing a fancy geospatial mobile application.

You can displays maps from WMS servers or tile servers like OpenStreetMap. Custom data can be added: points, lines, images or even other widgets like buttons. All those can be bound to a specific coordinate.
A parser is included, which reads data from gllin. QMapControl is still in development, hopefully some people join the development.
