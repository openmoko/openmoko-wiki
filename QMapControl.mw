Displays maps from WMS servers or tile servers like OpenStreetMap. Custom data can be added: points, lines, images or even other widgets like buttons. All those can be bound to a specific coordinate.
A parser is included, which reads data from gllin. QMapControl is still in development, hopefully some people join the development.
