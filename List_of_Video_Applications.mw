  Name=Quasar|
  Description=An X11 mplayer front end, available from Angstrom. Not perfect for the FreeRunner - it ideally needs some UI work doing (more than just setting tweaking), especially on it's fonts, however, i have launched mpg QVGA videos with it and watched them as well as listening to music with it.|
