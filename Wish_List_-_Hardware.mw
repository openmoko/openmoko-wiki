==Wireless data networking==

===Integrated WiFi hardware===
With [[WiFi support in OpenMoko]], this enables:
*Syncing data.
*Accessing internet.
*Free text messaging.
*VoIP.
*For videoconferencing (as with AccessGrid)

Assorted [[Wifi power reduction|WiFi power reduction]] tricks may be used to increase battery life.

===WiMAX support===
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimax WiMAX] is a high-speed data service, similar to wifi, though longer range and newer. Where service is available, this would complement WiFi. Unfortunately, unlike wifi, frequencies vary worldwide, so global usage may be complex.

===Emerging Protocols===
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_Field_Communication Near Field Communication] has a few centimeter range, useable for keys, ID badges, pairing bluetooth devices and similar uses. Mentioned in newer bluetooth and SD standards. (No products.)
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZigBee ZigBee] is designed for connecting sensors and switches in buildings, with many options including mesh networks and aggressive power saving compared to bluetooth. (Almost no products available.)
*The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANT_(network) ANT network] is for connecting worn devices. Similar to ZigBee, but much simpler and maybe lower power. ([http://www.thisisant.com/?section=9 short list] of products.)

==Camera==

=== Camera interface ===

The [[Neo1973_Hardware#Processor|current Neo1973 processor]] does not have a camera interface. A chip with the [http://www.mipi.org/ MIPI] interface might be used as a future proof solution.

===Video-capable camera===
* A camera that is able to take reasonable quality video and pictures is something many want. Applications vary from simple snapping, to gesture interfaces, video conferencing, barcode reading, buisness card reading, healthcare, servicing, and more.

* Some people can't take cameras into work - a model without the camera, or some way of removing the camera would be useful.

* [[Wishlist:Camera]] detailed wishlist.

==Display==
===Multitouch screen===

''Main article: [[Wishlist:Spell_weaving|Spell weaving]]''

See also [http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/03/27/the-multi-touch-screen/ this page] containing a link to a video demonstration.

===TV Out===
With help of mouse and keyboard, a TV output may be very useful.
Or to watch photos taken with a digital camera on holidays.
Or for showing a slide presentation off.

=== Larger Screen ===

A model with a larger screen would be of use to many, especially with multi-touch. Higher resolution is probably less important than size until the DPI drops below 150 or so.


=== Tiny Video Projector - "Beamer" ===

At the [http://www.sid.org/conf/sid2007/sid2007.html DisplayWeek2007] several embeded video projectors for phones were presented. 
 Those projecting devices are not much bigger than a cell phone. A LED-laser projects a sharp image at variable distance
Could such a device be connected by bluetooth?
 [http://www.explay.co.il/ Explay] uses two a red and a green laser-LED as well as a conventional blue LED in its "oio".
 Blue laser-LED are to expensive for customer products. The light passes a transmissive WVGA-LCD(640x480) and goes on to the screen. Its frequency is 60Hz and the projecting distance can be varied from 20cm(8inch) to 2m(80inch) with a sharp picture. It consumes about 5W and its light power is about 6 lumen.
 As the sharpness does not depend on distance, one can project the image on screens that are not plane. Like someones t-shirt.

 [http://www.microvision.com/ Microvistions] PicoProjektor however uses soley laser-LEDs. It is also 60Hz though 800x600px or 800x640.

 Potential problems might become the approval of a laser class 3 device.

 Final prices could be about $300.

===Video acceleration===
Hardware acceleration for video playback.
===3D acceleration===
3D hardware acceleration for 3D games, GUIs, etc. (maybe a PowerVR MBX Lite ?).

===HMD===
Possibility to use something like [http://www.aeinnovations.com/projects/ver0/ Eyeglass Mounted Display].

===EPD===
Or electronic paper display, EPD is used in many new devices such as the new Motorola motofone, sonys new e-reader and Irex's iliad. The technology provides thin, flexible, power saving screens using new eink technology. This technology could cut the weight of the phone and its power usage. For more info see: [http://www.eink.com eink's website].

===Multi I/O adapter===
*VGA, standard Jack (line in
