==Hardware enhancements==

Some small hardware enhancement could be cheap, but very useful. Please add your ideas/wishes here:
<br \>
===Video-capable camera===
* A camera that is able to take reasonable quality video and pictures is something many want. Applications vary from simple snapping, to gesture interfaces, video conferencing, barcode reading and more.

* Some people can't take cameras into work - a model without the camera, or some way of removing the camera would be useful.

* This is also useful for several business applications (like healthcare, servicing, etc)

* Camera with macro - useful for taking pictures of flowers/insects, but also for scanning business cards for an automated business card to contact informantion process

===Integrated WiFi hardware===
*To sync data
*To access Internet when WiFi is available (at home, work, school, friends)
*Free text messaging.
*For VoIP (this uses much power but maybe the user have the charger connected)
*For videoconferencing (as with AccessGrid)
*802.11b 11Mbps -only would do -- the point is being able to connect it to the Internet without incurring the (sometimes huge) costs of telecoms providers.
*To save power have WiFi able to wake up and check for a designated SSID then sleep again if not found (i.e. I'm not home) or wake up by GPS location (only come up at home and in the office)
*Variable TX power, to the minimum needed to connect to the AP.
*Some sort of caching (encrypted?) internet proxy that can store and forward packets. Instead of having the radio constantly on, it turns the radio on every 30s, for just long enough to register with the AP, and ask the proxy if it has new packets for it.
** An optimisation might be if the hardware, and the AP can do broadcast packets. The receiver is only turned on for .5s/30s, to recieve a broadcast packet saying 'you've got packets' without registering with the AP, or transmitting at all. The GPS synchronises the timing.
**This slows the initial connection to the phone, but most tcp/ip applications will not time out in 30s.

===Galileo receiver===
*A GPS module with firmware thet could be upgraded to support Galileo (the new European navigation system) would be nice eventually, it does not seem to be near-term due to chipset availability problems.

===LED===
*A blinking LED would be cheap and low power, good for informing the user about new SMS/Email....
**An alternative to this would be for one segment of the LCD to be seperately backlit. There are many LEDs in the backlight, all normally on. This has the advantage that you can display reasonable amounts of information on the bit of the screen that's illuminated. 
**The disadvantage is the field of view is smaller, and it's dimmer than a bare LCD, as the LCD absorbs some light.
**This also requires the CPU and LCD to be somewhat active, to keep it refreshed.

*Note: the LED and button ideas could be combined: illuminated buttons
*A yellow LED for GSM/GPRS Tx burst, a blue one for Bluetooth/WiFi Tx burst, a green one for non-urgent notifications (sleep state, missed call etc.) and a red one for urgent notifications (battery almost drained out, new SMS etc.). All of this could be done in one, multicoloured (RGB) LED, similar to the nice one on the Yaesu VX-7R.

===D-Pad and Buttons===
*Adding a D-pad (to the bottom of the phone) and 2 to 4 buttons (to the top) would provide some tactile input controls, in addition to the touchscreen. They could be used as shortcut keys in the menu, or playback control when playing media. When the phone is held sideways, they can be used as games controls. (With touchscreen alone, gameplay options are limited)

Game buttons would be best on both sides of the screen. The larger the buttons, the better. 2x 4 buttons in up-down-left-right configuration + some extra buttons separately a bit lower on the device would be good for many for emulation games. 

Here is a concept drawing of a possible neo1973 gaming version: 
(This has a 4-way direction pad, 8 way may be better for gaming)

===Accelerometer=== 
This enables the phone to sense where 'down' is - to enable various options.

*[[Wishlist:Distance Measuring|Distance Measuring]]
*[[Wishlist:Dynamic Screen Orientation|Dynamic Screen Orientation]]

*Change playlist when jogging vs walking. (there is an mp3 player on the market that does this).
**GPS uses a moderate amount of power when on, it would be nice to save this. (though it is a small amount compared to the power draw from playing MP3s.

====3 axes Accellerometer and gyros====
*Most of these would at least benefit from 3 axis accelerometer, and integrated gyros, for some it may be required.
**Shake mitigation when using the camera (wish list item #1).  How many of us end up with blurry pictures because we can't hold the phone steady?

===SIR/FIR transceiver (Serial Infrared)===
*An infrared tranceiver is cheap, small, and useful for sync with many laptops and mobile phones. A learning infrared remote is another application.
*Tt could be used to detect when to turn off the display (if the low power IR signal is reflected) and activate the key lock.
*FIR would be a nice option, as it's some 40 times faster than SIR.

===Standard 3.5mm jack===
Adaptors to 2.5mm are of course available, but 3.5mm jacks are much more robust.
One question would be are headsets available in 3.5mm.

==Display==
===Multitouch screen===

[[Wishlist:Spell_weaving]]

===TV Out===
With help of mouse and keyboard, TV out may be very useful.

=== 800x600 (SVGA) resolution ===

Providing 800x600 (SVGA) resolution will make using the web browser, and many other applications, as comfortable as using a desktop computer.
* Finding a such high-res display in a small package (2.8") should be damn hard. Imho VGA for 2.8" is damn high. Also the currently used SoC only supports VGA iirc.

===Video acceleration===
Hardware acceleration for video playback.
===3D acceleration===
3D hardware acceleration for 3D games, GUIs, etc. (maybe a PowerVR MBX Lite ?).

===HMD===
Possiblity to use something like [http://www.aeinnovations.com/projects/ver0/ Eyeglass Mounted Display].

===EPD===
Or electronic paper display, EPD is used in many new devices such as the new Motorola motofone, sonys new e-reader and Irex's iliad. The technology provides thin, flexible, power saving screens using new eink technology. This technology could cut the weight of the phone and its power usage. For more info see: [http://www.eink.com eink's website].

===Multi I/O adapter===
*VGA, standard Jack (line in & out), standard USB

===MMC/SD/SDIO slot (rather than?) miniSD or microSD===
*Cheaper, more durable cards in a widely accepted format.
*Cards are harder to lose
*Wider selection of accesories, including SDIO accessories.
*Make externally available so that larger length SDIO cards can be used (thinking about SDIO WLAN here)
*Only because CF takes too much room (or CF would be the wish, instead)

===Two SD slots===
*Micro SD for /home partition.
*Hot swapable mini or normal SD for movie, music etc.

===[[Expansion Back]]===
* Replacement backs with additional features
* I believe this would be a great idea, if put into practice. It would solve the ''extensibility'' need, usually associated with Open Source projects. It would allow for lots of other devices and for functionality to be developed and put into use without making it a burden for FIC.
** With extra card slots and small footprint hard drive (if possible), Neo might become a nice ''image tank'' for photographers - --[[User:Cedel|cedel]] 18:34, 19 February 2007 (CET)

===Thumb keyboard or keyboard attachment accessory===
*Could be slide out or clamshell (hinge on long side) design with an external OLED. The keyboard should be protected when not in use.
*Could be a clip on keyboard that attaches to the serial port or communicates by bluetooth (not preferred for permanent keyboard users).
*cheap clippable miniusb keyboard

===Faster/better mobile connectivity.===
GSM/GPRS is at best slow. Ideally supporting EDGE - which is an evolved form of GPRS, UTMS - which is widespread in europe, HDSPA (asia) and any other mobile standards would be nice.
It is unlikely that all of these will be supported initially, but it is a goal.
Until that goal is reached, it is likely that some phones will be brought out for various specific markets - europe, asia, US.

===WiMAX support===
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimax WiMAX] is targeting high-speed mobile data and telecommunications services. Hardware for portable usage based on the IEEE802.16e standard is now availabe and deployment around the world is being executed, heavily promoted by [http://www.worldmax.nl/en/News/6 Intel Capital]. For example, a Dutch initiative called [http://www.worldmax.nl/en WorldMAX] has the exclusive license to use the 3.5GHz band in The Nethelands to offer "internet-in-your-pocket" services.

===Ability to insert more than one Sim-Card and (if possible) connect to more than one network at the same time===

* This could be achieved via a specialist dual sim card kit (currently on market)- where two sims are trimmed and combined on one card, software support for dual sims would need providing...
* What about twin-SIMs (SIMs with 2 phone lines registered on them)? Conventional GSM phones have an option to switch between the two, older ones use # (long press before dialling) to do that. I'm guessing Calypso should support it, we just need to provide an interface for it :-) --[[User:Csdexter|@Dexter]] 11:34, 19 February 2007 (CET)
-- This is ALS (Alternate Line Service) and is a network feature which must be activated on your account. You should be able to get the GSM modem to send a USSD sequence to the network an achieve this. Newer, handsets/networks would support the Multiple Subscriber Profiles which handles it all better but you are right that it would need to be included in the UI. [[User:Eggsy]]

===RFID tag===
* Implementation/Cooperation with: [http://www.rfidguardian.org/ RFID-Guardian]
*An enable-able tag would be of use - for example being able to use the phone to open doors, or cars. Unfortunately, it's moderately hard to do secure programmable tags that are compatible with existing systems, for obvious reasons.

=== USB ===
* USB 2.0
* Powered, to avoid having to carry around a hub for when you want to occasionally plug in a memory stick. Many powered hubs will not recognise a totally unpowered host.
* OTG (is this maybe supported already ?)
* Bootable USB device emulation: the possibility to boot any computer on a bootable flagged partition of the transflash

===Speakerphone===
* A speakerphone is more than simply connecting the speakers to GSM audio, it's also echo cancellation, and eliminating the feedback that will otherwise happen between the speakers and the mic. This software has not been written.

===Special covers===
* A standard slip-on or clip-on template (possibly with buttons) to make the touch-screen blind accessible
* Small metal frame for protection (like Siemens M65, only with more style)

===FM/Digital Radio(DAB) Reciever===
A nice feature would be a radio reciever: FM or even better: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Audio_Broadcasting Digital Audio Broadcast] (Digital Radio)

===Thermometer===
An electronic thermometer might become handy for some users.

There are very small [[I2C]] devices available, that could easily integrate to the existing bus. For example [http://focus.ti.com/docs/prod/folders/print/tmp100.html this one from ti].

===I2C breakout===
[[I2C]] is an internal bus in the phone. This is a simple bus, with only 2-3 wires, hence ideal for making accessible to those making add-ons, as it is low powered, and can be daisy-chained. It would be  a great candidate to bring out into the [[Expansion Back]].

Readily available [[I2C]] chips range from temperature sensing, digital input/ouput chips, to 1-wire bridge chips (which is designed for external switches, ID, sensing, ...)

===Finger print sensor===
Fingerprint sensor gives easy and fast access to the phone, could lock the touchscreen etc. An example of this device can be found at [http://www.sonystyle.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/en/-/USD/SY_BrowseCatalog-Start?CategoryName=cpu_VAIONotebookComputers_UX_Series&Dept=computers Sony UX17].

As these are typically implemented with a small camera (256*4) focussed on the finger, with appropriate hardware and software, you can also use them as an optical mouse in reverse, detecting movement of the finger over the sensor.

===Trackball===
A trackball would provide an efficient mouse-like interface in a very compact package.  As exemplified in the newer Blackberry&reg; models.

===Analog Joystick===
How 'bout an analog joystick, gaming-console style, instead of a D-Pad or a trackball?

Or how 'bout a [http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,1772689,00.asp Rollermouse]-like device? But do we need any of this, considering the touchscreen?

===Laser Pointer===
Include a built in laser pointer.  Everything is better with lasers.

===Completely free hardware===
Consider selling one device with absolutely no non-free components in it, even if that means dropping the GSM support.  I believe having one such device available would be good, because then it could be recommended by organizations like the FSF which typically never recommends anything if it has even a little non-free code in it.

=== Hard Drive ===

Providing a hard drive, will allow storing music, movies, etc. Add USB storage device capability to use the device as an external hard drive.

==Ideas that will probably never be implemented==
[[Wishlist:Unlikely]]
