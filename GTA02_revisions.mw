This page summarizes the revisions of the GTA02 hardware, both pre-release and planned future revisions.

The internal codename of the [[Neo FreeRunner]] was GTA02. [[Neo_1973_vs_Neo_FreeRunner|Compared]] to the previous [[GTA01]], it has the same physical dimensions, screen and RAM, but more flash storage, a faster processor, plus wifi and accelerometers. The next major revision is expected to be [[GTA03]].

All Neo FreeRunners that have been released to the public at this time are [[#GTA02v6|revision 6]]. There are a few persons with r5, but they were manually adapted to the state of r6.

== GTA02v1 ==
First generation of prototypes that was given to internal Openmoko software developers. Total 30 pcs fabricated.

*It is working just fine, but still based on 2440, with external NAND/SDRAM and no NOR flash
*Using the PCF50633 05 N3 due to 04 N3 not available, re-work power for basic schematics verification
*Using GTA01 SIM socket
*Add external debug port
*Still using Global locate A-GPS
* ATAG_REVISION: 0310

== GTA02v2 ==
Second generation of prototypes, Total 50 pcs run at Taipei SMT factory MOUNT

*Ideal is have 256 MB NAND on Samsung package, Due to chip availability Start using S3C2442 B43
*Using correct PMU PCF50633 04 N3
*Change new SIM socket
*Change to u-blox A-GPS
*Change LCM power from 3.3v to 1.8v
*USB power switch layout/pin assignment mistake, could not verify USB host supply 5v function
*GPS function verified ok with good sensitivity
* ATAG_REVISION: 0320

== GTA02v3 ==
Production verification version, 2007/10/11 28 pcs fabricate at FIC SuZhou

*Still using S3C2442 B43 for hardware verification
*Using control pilot run to verify S3C2442 B54 chips<br>
* ATAG_REVISION: 0330

== GTA02v4 ==
Mass production release candidate version 1

2 weeks after v3 gerber out, release the v4 gerber, and 2007/10/20 20 pcs fabricate at FIC SuZhou 

*Change LCM power from 1.8v to 3.3v for display stability issue
*fabricate another 200 pcs for yield rate/production verification
*fabricate 50 pcs with S3C2442 B43 (128 MB NAND) for quality comparsion
*USB host power chip have some output voltage stability issues with Vb/Vcc comes from different power source, need layout change to fix the issue
*Battery Coulomb design not working on A4
* ATAG_REVISION: 0340

== GTA02v5 ==
Mass production candidate version 2/Mass production version

* First batch fabricate 2008/1/14 at FIC SuZhou
* Mass production A5 trial run start from 2008 March, including some resistor/capacitor change compare with inital 100 pcs prototypes A5, and prototypes for GTA02 developers was tracked in the [[Prototypes| Prototypes Page]]
* Coulomb counter issue fixed
* USB host power switch fixed
* Need add capacitor for PMU Vbat input for stability issue, this could be done by direct SMT or hand rework
* Need rework (still using SMT in production) add capacitor for PMU Vbat input for PMU stability issue.
* Need manual rework GSM IR UART path a 100k pull down for better GSM deep sleep
* ATAG_REVISION: 0350

===GTA02 mass Production version change list===
*PMU's LED power error: PMU potential damage issue
*NOR FLASH enable WP: User can write data into NOR FLASH.
*CE CS/RS fine tune: Audio's background noise too high
*I2C pull high resistor: The resistor is too high and signal is distorted 
*GSM leakage current: TX_MODEM has a pull high resistor on IO_3V3
*Power consumption: Disable keep active function
*SDIO clock and esd protect resistor
*Refer to Datasheet: R1526 to 33K
*GSM modem on pin: The R1018 is too small and has some leakage current
*LED driving transistor: When GPIO is on, the transistor will be draw more current on LED. This is component change fix, do not need change PCB or re-work.

== GTA02v6 ==
Mass production candidate version 3/Mass production version<br>

A6 will be fine tune version of A5, only minor [http://downloads.openmoko.org/schematics/GTA02/ schematic] change for better product quality and version control. Capacitor and resistor change A6 also on mass production A5<br>

*First 100 pcs start from 2008 mid April, and factory make component placement mistake on GSM, second 100 pcs PCB arrive time TBD. 
*Add capacitor space for Vbat, reduce the SMT effort
*Add GSM IR resistor for better GSM deep sleep
*Reserve 3 GPIO for hardware version control
*Fixed LEDs power usage (from about 150mW of v5 to about 25mW)
* ATAG_REVISION: 0360

=== GTA02 A5 to A6 changes ===
*Power Glitch on VB_SYS: Add capacitor on layout, Mass production A5 also apply this change.
*G-sensor separate these interrupt pins: At A5, each accelerometer INT1/INT2 connected to same line, at A6 only INT1 was connected.
*GSM_modem power source  Reduce power's ripple when the phone is talking
*Keep active 	Disable keep active function, just fine tune
*GPIO for version control	
*GSM RX_IR has some noise  Add resistor and reduce GSM RX_IR noise and gsm can't enter suspend mode easily, apply on mass production A5.
*LED driving transistor	apply on mass production A5.
*LCM's VDDIO	We can totally power off LCM's power, save about extra 1mA.
