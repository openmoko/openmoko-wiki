First you should modify this file in your desk-top computer


 > sudo vi /etc/default/bluetooth


then press "/pand" to find  " PAND_ENABLED=0  "

And now you should change the 0 into 1 ("PAND_ENABLED=1")


 > sudo /etc/init.d/bluetooth restart

  
  
Restart the bluetooth device.
After restarting the bluetooth, you will see Bluetooth PAN daemon information.

That means you wake up the PAN daemon suscessfully:P

After that,you should pass the argument to let PAN daemon know what it should do now.

 > sudo pand -s 

this command let desk-top computer  be a Server to listen  the other linux-based devices

which is connecting it through the bluetooth.

In the Neo:

 > echo "1" > /sys/bus/platform/devices/neo1973-pm-bt.0/power_on
 > echo "0" > /sys/bus/platform/devices/neo1973-pm-bt.0/reset

Searching for near bluetooth device 

 > hcitool scan

Put the wanted  bluetooth's Mac (Address)  in this line

 > export PC_BT_ID=(bluetooth's Mac)
 > pand -c $PC_BT_ID --service NAP --autozap

 > ifconfig bnep0 10.0.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.0

Switch to the Desk-top computer :

 >sudo ifconfig bnep0 10.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0

This means that desk-top computer will  set up environment for connectiog the Neo.

Then, you can use the "ping" command to check whether the connection is build sucessfully or not.

 > ping 10.0.0.2

// send the testing data to the Neo

If it does work,you will receive following information.

PING 10.0.0.2 (10.0.0.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=xx.x ms
64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=xx.x ms
64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=xx.x ms

........

Also,you can copy datas to the Neo.

 > scp XXX.X root@10.0.0.2:

That's all.
Enjoy:)
