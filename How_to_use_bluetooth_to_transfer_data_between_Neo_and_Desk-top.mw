This page , we will introduce about , how to active your Neo bluetooth device via host. You can follow these step to learn how to transfer date between Neo and PC. 

==configure your setting of host ==
First you should modify this bluetooth setting file in your desk-top computer:


 > sudo vi /etc/default/bluetooth


then search for the keyword "/pand" to find  " PAND_ENABLED=0  "

And now you should change the 0 into 1 
 
 ("PAND_ENABLED=1")

After you modify the setting, use this command to restart bluetooth device.

 > sudo /etc/init.d/bluetooth restart

After restarting the bluetooth, you will see Bluetooth PAN daemon information.

That means you wake up the '''PAN''' daemon suscessfully :P

After that,you should pass the argument to let PAN daemon know what it should do now.

 > sudo pand -s 

this command let desk-top computer  be a Server to listen  the other linux-based devices

which is connecting it through the bluetooth.

==On the Neo side==
In the Neo:

 > echo "1" > /sys/bus/platform/devices/neo1973-pm-bt.0/power_on
 > echo "0" > /sys/bus/platform/devices/neo1973-pm-bt.0/reset

this command will search nearly bluetooth device. 

 > hcitool scan

Put the wanted  bluetooth's Mac (Address)  in this line

 > export PC_BT_ID=(bluetooth's Mac)
 > pand -c $PC_BT_ID --service NAP --autozap

 > ifconfig bnep0 10.0.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.0

Switch back to the Desk-top computer :

 >sudo ifconfig bnep0 10.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0

This means that desk-top computer will  set up environment for connectiog the Neo.

Then, you can use the "ping" command to check whether the connection is build sucessfully or not.

 > ping 10.0.0.2

// send the testing data to the Neo

If it works ,you will receive following message:

PING 10.0.0.2 (10.0.0.2) 56(84) bytes of data.

 64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=xx.x ms
 64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=xx.x ms
 64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=xx.x ms

........

==Start to transfer date==
Also,you can copy datas to the Neo.

 > scp XXX.X root@10.0.0.2:

That's all.
Enjoy:)
