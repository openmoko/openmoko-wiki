{{Languages|DeforaOS}}

[[DeforaOS]] is a multi-purpose Operating System, providing an ubiquitous, secure and transparent access to the user's resources. It features a POSIX-compliant environment, and can work on top of existing systems (Linux, *BSD...). Its desktop environment is focused on usability,
coherence and integration, with many applications available already. Developed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, it suits modern
embedded platforms as well.
