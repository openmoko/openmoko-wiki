= Qtopia on X11 =

== What ==
Running Qtopia apps and services on X11 with enlightenment as window manager. This is done to benefit from the applications and working services but still allow integration with other toolkits and systems. The difficulty is to integrate Qtopia into the freedesktop.org world. This includes launching of apps, services, window management, installation, FHS obeyance...

== Open issues ==
* QCOP warning (empty setDocument) in todolist, datebook
* Launching of applications
* Interaction between screen lock and qpe e.g. with incoming phone calls while being suspended
* better GTA02 integration
* Screenlock, blanking, suspend handling, e.g. Qtopia wants to know when it is waking up, the blanking of the screen should be handled by e though.
* Services, Single launching of apps.
* Packaging in OpenEmbedded

== What to learn from it ==
=== Service defintions and Service Providers ===

With Qtopia you can describe a service and give the user the choice to pick the preferred service. Read more about services [http://doc.trolltech.com/qtopia4.3/services.html here]. Basicly you define a service Foo.servie and then have a directory Foo/ and providers of this service can put a file with their name into this directory.

=== Content management ===
[http://doc.trolltech.com/qtopia4.3/qcontent.html Content] is abstracted from a file hierachy to be type based. To continue with this thought and to make it scale RDF, tree views, indexing comes into mind. Is there something we can learn from here besides making it scale?

=== Value Space ===
What is a value space? It looks like it is a cross process way to define a tree of values. You can query state, features and similar things with it. The entry to the documentation can be found [http://doc.trolltech.com/qtopia4.3/qvaluespaceobject.html#details here].

=== Input methods ===
Besides using an optimized Trie with a mmapable representation (fast lookups even of huge dictionaries!) you can attach a input method hint to any QWidget.E.g. if you need to insert an IP address into a QLineEdit the input method could show a special mode to assist in this. [http://doc.trolltech.com/qtopia4.3/qtopiaapplication.html#setInputMethodHint Setting a hint] for the current widget, this can be an arbitrary string, the actual hint is then a file in the etc/im directory.
