If you have all your Contacts in one file you can import them with the following script: [http://paste.frubar.net/8552]

The important parts are taken from [[User:Wurp|Wurp]]s [[Import_Sim_Contacts]] script.

== Export vCards from Mac OS X Addressbook ==

# set the vCard Format to 2.1 in the config dialog
# select all contacts and say "export vcard"
# despite having selected the charset to be utf-8 you may need to do:
<code>
 iconv -f latin1 -t utf-8 vCards.vcf | sed 's/CHARSET=LATIN1://g' > all.vcf
</code>
