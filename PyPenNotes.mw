== Overview ==
Little tool to write notes using pen and touchscreen.

This program is written in [[Python]] using pygtk. It can be used only if those are present in your environment (see [[PyPenNotes#Environment]]).

== Current Features ==

* Change color and size of pen
* Change background color (even on used notebook pages)
* Undo
* Save and Restore 
** Using the file '''~/.penNotes.strokes_data'''
** You may symlink that to your SD-Card if you like...
* As many Notes as you like 
** (1-9999, or no RAM left ;-) ) 
** 200 simple Notes may take about 10 MByte (should be less with Version 0.3 - so this is a vague estimate)

== Planned Features ==

* Manage different notebooks (choose place to save them)

== Download ==

===Bugs===
On my device it can't start because there is a bug in pygtk:
line 82 of /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/gtk2.0/gtk/__init__.py change init() to _init()

== Installation ==

The following Om 2008.8 packages will have to be installed (source packages: python python-pygtk python-pycairo python-pygobject) (For Om 2007.2 you can use the ScaredyCat packages from [[Repositories]].):

 python-core python-misc python-lang python-pygtk

Until there is an IPK for pyPenNotes, you may want to create a desktop icon manually. 

Extract the files to a directory you wish (in the following example we use /media/card/install/pyPenNotes-0.3b/ directory).

Create the desktop file:

 /usr/share/applications/pypennotes.desktop

With content:
