== Overview ==
Little tool to write notes using pen and touchscreen.

This program is written in [[Python]] using pygtk. It can be used only if those are present in your environment (see [[PyPenNotes#Environment]]).

== Current Features ==

* Change color and size of pen
* Change background color (even on used notebook pages)
* Undo
* Save and Restore 
** Using the file '''~/.penNotes.strokes_data'''
** You may symlink that to your SD-Card if you like...
* As many Notes as you like 
** (1-9999, or no RAM left ;-) ) 
** 200 simple Notes may take about 10 MByte (should be less with Version 0.3 - so this is a vague estimate)

== Planned Features ==

* Manage different notebooks (choose place to save them)
