== Overview ==
qwo is an implementation of Quikwriting, an efficient way to input text for hand-held devices without picking your finger off the screen. It is based on X so it should work most distributions but not Qtopia.

== Installation ==
qwo requires imlib2 and [http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/ libconfig] to run. Binaries are available from the project web page or you can install by hand :
<pre>
opkg install http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/qwo/libimlib2-1_1.4.2.001+svnr39502-r0.1_armv4t.ipk \
http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/qwo/libconfig_1.3.1_armv4t.ipkk \
http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/qwo/qwo_0.5-r0.1_armv4t.ipk
</pre>
Next you need to configure it, follow these [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Keyboard_Debate#How_to_install_the_illume_.28Raster.27s.29_keyboard_.3F instructions] and then switch the keyboard to qwo in illume's preferences.

== Usage ==
To enter a character that is in the center of a region start in the middle one, go to the region and then back to the middle. To input the adjacent character go to the region closest region before returning to the center.
The arrow will turn the letters to upper case for one stroke, a gesture starting from the region containing the 'a' in the middle to 's' will lock in upper case.
To input an extended character you do the same gestures without starting and ending in the center.
A gesture starting from the region containing '<' to the one containing the 'u' will show a help screen with the extended characters, execute the same gesture to return to the normal display. For example Ctrl is entered by dragging diagonally from region 4 (which contains the ctrl icon) to region 8 (bottom middle).

You can resize the window by issuing a gesture starting in one of the outer region, going to all other regions in a circle except the center one and ending past the one in which you started. The incremented size is multiplied by the number of region past the starting one where you lift your finger. Issuing this gesture clockwise grows the window, counter-clockwise shrinks it.

== Customisation ==
You can add keys to a config file to extend the character set. See the README file included or the [http://www.nongnu.org/qwo/ web page] for more information.

== Transparency ==
It is possible to run the qwo keyboard in transparent mode. More information (screenshots, description how to set it up) is available at [http://kedrigern.dcs.fmph.uniba.sk/~riso/Openmoko/qwo/]
