See [[Neo1973_Hardware#GTA01Bv4|Neo1973 Hardware]] for what components GTA01B_v04 contains.

Neo Base -- everything the mobile application developer needs to enjoy
the benefits of the first freed phone, the Neo1973:

 * Neo1973 (GTA01B_v4)
 * Battery (1200mAh)
 * Stylus
 * Headset
 * Phone Pouch
 * Lanyard
 * SanDisk 512MB MicroSD Card
 * Mini USB Connectivity Cable

Neo Advanced -- everything the mobile device hacker wants to get down
and dirty with the first freed phone, the Neo1973:

 * Neo1973 (GTA01B_v4)
 * Battery (1200mAh) (2x)
 * Stylus
 * Headset
 * Phone Pouch
 * Lanyard
 * SanDisk 512MB MicroSD Card (2x)
 * Mini USB Connectivity Cable (2x)
 * Debug Flex Cable
 * Debug Board v2 (JTAG and serial console)

You do not need the Advanced package to do normal kernel, or application development, only perhaps hacking on [[u-boot]].

As described in [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2007-June/006005.html Sean's post on mailing list] (with some adjustments/corrections).
