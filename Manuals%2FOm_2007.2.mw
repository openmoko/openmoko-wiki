Please notice it is strongly recommended to update to any recent distro (probably the first thing you should do with your FR after some hours of drooling and playing), as the info herein is completely out of date, as is the software this is about.

===Navigating menus and applications===
====Today Page====

[[Image:Todaypage_reduced_true.png|200px|right]] Openmoko starts by displaying the "Today" page, which is your home page. Icons in the top row indicate the status of the phone. The bottom row consists of three tabs. The tab with a house on the left leads to the "Today" page you're viewing now. The central tab leads to the "Launch Task" page, which is the main menu used to start applications. The tab with gears on the right leads to the "Running Tasks" page, which is used to deal with currently open windows and applications.

[[Image:Todaypage_reduced_false.png|right|200px|]] The "Today" page is empty, as shown above, when you first start Openmoko. We explain below how to turn on the "full view", displayed to the right. In the full view, a second row of icons give quick links to commonly-used applications such as the dialer, the adressbook, mailbox and calendar. The main body of the screen displays a clock and other useful information.

See [[Today/2007.2]] for more information about the Today page and customization.

====Launch Task Page====

{{stub}}

[[Image:LaunchTasks.png|right|200px]] This page displays a menu of available applications.  You may choose a category of applications to display to simplify the screen, or choose to display them all.

Current categories are [PIM Suite], [[Om_2007.2_Applications|Applications]], [[Games/Om 2007.2|Games]], Utilities, and All.

<br clear=all />

====Running Tasks Page====

{{stub}}

[[Image:RunningTasks.png|right|200px]] This page displays currently-running tasks.  Any individual task may be terminated by selecting it and then clicking on the garbage-can icon to close it.  All tasks may be terminated by clicking on any one of them and then clicking on the "folder" icon in the upper right (expect this to change in future releases).  Any task may be rejoined by selecting it and then selecting the "return" icon at the middle top.

<br clear=all />

====Exiting from and switching to an Application====

Any time an application is running, you can simply click the device's power button and the application will exit, returning you to the Today page.

Alternatively, you can cycle through active applications using the AUX button

Clicking the top-left of the screen displays the drop down ''task menu''. This menu lists all active applications and allows to switch directly to any one. ''Note:'' If the task menu is not shown, click and hold the [[#Aux|Aux]] button to bring up the Aux menu, and select "Toggle Fullscreen".

=== Using the terminal ===

To start a console from "Today" page, click the middle tab at the bottom of the screen to display the "Launch applications" page, then select Terminal in the "Applications" submenu. The multitaps keyboard slides up (and down) from the bottom of the screen automatically when you touch the screen.

====Setting date and time====

From the terminal, type the following, but replace ''MM'' with the month (01-12); ''DD'' with the day (01-31); ''hhmm'' with the time (0000-2359); ''YYYY'' with the  year (optional); and ''.ss'' with the seconds (optional).

 date -s ''MMDDhhmmYYYY.ss''

To make the change persist between reboots, sync the hardware clock with the updated system time.

hwclock --systohc

See [[Setting Date and Time]] for more discussion, including synchronizing with an NTP server.

Note: UNIX traditionally sets the system clock to GMT (UTC) or "Zulu" (Z time zone). So I use the stanza:
 date -u MMDDhhmmYYYY.ss (well, I usually ignore the seconds)
Then I can set the local time using the techniques described elsewhere. iceworm

==== Accessing the microSD card ====

Mounted at /media/card by default.
<pre>
ã€€mount /media/card
</pre>
If you have multiple partitions on the card, the first (/dev/mmcblk0p1) will be mounted at /media/card, the second at /media/mmcblk0p2, the third at /media/mmcblk0p3 etc. To setup the package management to write on the microSD card when installing new software follow the [[Package_management | package management guide]].
