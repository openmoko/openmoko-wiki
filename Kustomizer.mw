{{Languages|Kustomizer}}

''If you want to use Freerunner with OM2008.12 as a usable phone and music player and internet device and gps device then there's so many things you have to install and configure before it's usable. It took me a lot of time to get everything installed and configured (and there's still some things to do). But now there's the Kustomizer, maybe this can make life a little easier.''

=== Description ===
[[Image:Kustomizer-home.png|thumb|Home view]]Kustomizer is a script that converts your clean OM 2008.12 installation on Openmoko Freerunner into a usable phone/pda/toy/something.

The script is licensed with GPLv2 licence. The applications that it installs around the Net might have other licenses, check the original sites for more information.

Originally it was written to make it easy to try some apps after a clean installation for opkg.org application tests ([http://risto.kurppa.fi/blog/opkgorg-software-test-part-i/ review part one], [http://risto.kurppa.fi/blog/opkgorg-software-review-part-2/ review part two]) and 'recover' easily after that but in the end it became a script that might be useful for others, too.

Send questions and comments to [http://risto.kurppa.fi/blog Risto H. Kurppa] ( risto at kurppa dot fi ) or to the [[Development_resources#Mailing_Lists|Community mailing list]].

=== Warnings ===
[[Image:Kustomizer-install.png|thumb|Screenshot of the installation screen]]
* Kustomizer will not fix your WSOD / BSOD / wlan connecting only once / etc issues
* Flashing 2008.12 will wipe your rootfs
* Backup all your important data - just to be sure!
* Kustomizer is more or less under development

=== What does it do? ===
You can run Kustomizer once or twice. Here's an explanation what happens:

==== First run ====
The first time you run Kustomizer, it installes opkg.org repository, Illume-theme and terminal keyboard, files for better call audio quality, xterm. Also a CPU resource bug is fixed (qpe). A restart is required for this to take effect and Kustomizer will do this for you.

    * illume-theme
    * terminal keyboard
    * wrench & qwerty buttons
    * opkg.org repository added
    * qpe eating CPU resources -bug fix
    * new gsmhandset.state for improved audio quality
    * Restart to apply the new settings

==== Second run ====
The second run will install the rest: applications, GPRS, link map direcories from µSD card, mokoservices and tap/untap etc. You don't have to make the second run if you don't want.

    * Navit repository added
    * Linking /home/root/Maps to /media/card/Maps
    * Loads of coolest applications & libraries
    * GPRS settings
    * Freerunner-optimized Navit config XML. Preconfigured to use the map or Europe in /media/card/Maps/navit/europe.navit.bin
    * Your custom script from /media/card/customscript will be run, if found. See [http://kurppa.fi/freerunner/config_files/customscript example]
    * loads of various small fixes
    * Restart to apply the new settings

After the second installation, about 150MB of the 256MB rootfs is used.

=== Running the script ===
Script is available at http://www.kurppa.fi/freerunner/kustomizer

Here's the instructions what to do on your desktop to flash to 2008.12 and then what to do on Freerunner (over SSH!) to run the script.

 ## ON DESKTOP COMPUTER (written for Ubuntu 8.10 and newer)
 
 ## Prepare your memory card
  Here are some things you can put on your µSD card that will be mounted to /media/card. If you don't have these, it's OK.
  * /m/c/customscript - your own script that will be run in the end. You can write here all your custom requirements, I added the Finnish keyboard and some handy scripts, see http://kurppa.fi/freerunner/config_files/customscript
  * /m/c/Maps will be symlinked from /home/root/Maps. You can put your Openstreetmap map tiles there: TangoGPS uses this
  * /m/c/Maps/navit/europe.navit.bin will be used by Navit, preconfigured to do so
  * /m/c/Maps/navit/bookmarks.txt and destinations.txt will be copied to /home/root/.navit. These are the bookmarks and destinations for Navit
 
 ## REQUIRED PACKAGES
 # install required packages:
 # a) run: sudo apt-get install dfu-util bind9 
 # dfu-util is also available from http://downloads.openmoko.org/distro/releases/Om2008.9/dfu-util
 
 ## FLASH
 # for more details, see http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Flashing_the_Neo_Freerunner
 # download the required image files
 # b) run: wget http://downloads.openmoko.org/distro/releases/Om2008.12/Om2008.12-om-gta02.uImage.bin & wget http://downloads.openmoko.org/distro/releases/Om2008.12/Om2008.12-om-gta02.rootfs.jffs2
 # c) Connect your freerunner to the computer with the USB cable
 # d) start your Freerunner holding the AUX button down to get to the NOR menu
 # e) run: sudo time dfu-util -a kernel -R -D Om2008.12-om-gta02.uImage.bin
 # f) run: sudo time dfu-util -a rootfs -R -D Om2008.12-om-gta02.rootfs.jffs2
 # g) Start & restart Freerunner to be able to log in over USB ssh
 # h) Go to 'Settings' and change 'Suspend' to 'off' or Freerunner will suspend and the installation will fail.
 
 ## CONNECT
 # Connect over usb-ssh with shared internet connection
 # Don't run the script on Freerunner's screen! It can be done but not recommended if you don't know what you're doing.
 # Download a script to help you & change the permission
 # i) run: wget http://www.kurppa.fi/freerunner/fr_bind && chmod 755 fr_bind
 # j) run: ./fr_bind
 # k) First it asks for your Ubuntu -password to restart the interface & bind9 - type it in
 # l) After this it asks for Freerunner password - it's empty, just hit Enter 
 # For more details check http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Usb_networking#Ubuntu_8.10_-_Easy_Way  

 ## ON FREERUNNER
 
 # 1) Make sure you've turned 'Suspend' to 'off' in the Settings.
 # 2) Make sure you can SSH in over USB so that Freerunner has Internet connection (ping google.com?)
 # 3) run: wget http://www.kurppa.fi/freerunner/kustomizer_VERSION -O kustomizer && chmod 755 kustomizer
 # 4) run: ./kustomizer
 # On the first run it will install some stuff and then restart (to stop the qpe-bug). Then you need to repeat 2) and 4) and  it'll install the rest

Let the [http://risto.kurppa.fi/blog author] ( risto at kurppa dot fi ) know how did it go! You might not receive any help but it helps to develop the script further. If possible, please attach the log.

=== Good to know ===
* Rerunning a newer version of Kustomizer will most likely break something -> Don't try to update, only run on clean 2008.12
* During the second run many packages will fail with segfault/md5sum mismatch/missing dependencies/package not found. No harm done but also no app installed. It's because of bad packaging and we just have to wait for someone to fix it.
* Services -> gprs usually says 'FAILED' when you try to start GPRS but when you restart the app, it says 'GPRS ON' and shows the traffic counter.
* Enlightenment crashes sometimes, just click 'Recover' and you're fine again.
* For instructions how to manage icon folders and icons of apps you install later, check http://www.opkg.org/package_95.html

=== Development ===
If you have some ideas of improvements please let the author know (see above). I'm not planning to create rootfs images or anything huge but there are some things that I'd like to see kustomizer do. Check the script for the current TODO.

* Mailing list at http://groups.google.com/group/kustomizer
* '''Development version''': http://kurppa.fi/freerunner/kustomizer_devel - please also test this and let me know what you think!!
* Some log files: http://kurppa.fi/freerunner/kustomizer_files/
* Also check the talk page: http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Talk:Kustomizer

If someone is interested and willing to work on this please contact [http://risto.kurppa.fi/blog Risto H. Kurppa] ( risto at kurppa dot fi ). Moving to projects.openmoko is possible.
