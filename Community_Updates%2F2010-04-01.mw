Name=Debian GNU/Linux |
Description=[[Debian]] (http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Debian) is a universal operating system used on many other embedded devices, and also on home computers. Using Debian on the FreeRunner gives access to the Huge army of software packaged in the Debian repositories, already compiled for the Neo's arm(v4) processor. Moreover, one can build one's own source files for programs without having to learn the OpenEmbedded way. For an existing Debian/Ubuntu user, choosing Debian for Neo FreeRunner makes phone a very familiar, trustworthy and flexible place to hack in.<br><br>The following new noteworthy packages have appeared in the ''pkg-fso'' repository, a staging area for FreeRunner related packages not yet in official Debian:<br>- literki (http://pkg-fso.nomeata.de/sid/literki), keyboard with configurable layout and transparency<br>- woosh (http://pkg-fso.nomeata.de/sid/woosh), minimalistic browser optimized for touch screens<br>- libdrm-glamo (http://pkg-fso.nomeata.de/sid/libdrm-glamo1), userspace interface to glamo-specific kernel DRM services, more info at http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-fso-maint/2010-March/002731.html <br><br>Each of the above has varying reasons they are not yet uploaded to official Debian archives. Literki included a version of png++ in its sources, and png++ has now been separated and literki will soon follow it to official Debian archives. The future of woosh browser is a bit uncertain, so it's waiting a bit eg. for a better replacement. Finally, libdrm-glamo is naturally waiting for the eventual inclusion of Glamo code in an upstream release, together with the hopeful integration of all Glamo code in upstream (Torvalds') Linux kernel.<br><br>Besides applications, the following FSO components have been recently uploaded to official Debian archives: libphone-utils 0.1+git20091220-2, libgsm0710_1.2.1+git20100218-1, libfsobasics_0.9.0+git20100304-2, libfsoframework_0.2.4+git20100222-1, libfsotransport_0.9.5.9+git20100308-1, libgsm0710mux_0.9.1+git20100310-1, libfso-glib_0.2.1+git20100304-1 |
