{{Languages|Om 2008.9 Update}}
== Summary ==
The '''Om 2008.9 Update''' was the first of many [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_release point releases] to come after the initial [[Om2008.8|Om 2008.8 release]] and is now superseded by [[Om 2008.12 Update]].  It included general operating system improvements that enhance the stability, compatibility, and security of your Neo.

For detailed information about fixes and updates, please visit [https://docs.openmoko.org/trac/query?status=closed&group=component&order=priority&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&col=component&milestone=Om2008.9 Openmoko Trac].

<pre>
Products Affected:  Neo FreeRunner
</pre>

== Installing the update ==
{{Warning|It is recommended that you back up your Neo prior to installing any updates.
Do not attempt to install 2008.9 to the Neo 1973 (GTA01).  It is not compatible with this earlier model.}}
=== Download and Flashing ===

To install the exact 2008.9 point release, download the Root Filesystem and the Kernel image files from [http://downloads.openmoko.org/distro/releases/Om2008.9/ Download] page and install according to [[Flashing the Neo FreeRunner]].

If you prefer to stay at the head tip of the ASU distribution, just doing ''opkg update'' && ''opkg upgrade'' is enough. You may want to flash the splash screen only, but this is cosmetic.

The files with ''-20080916-'' in the name and the files without date are identical (symlinks actually). The three days discrepancy between 2008-09-16 (in the filenames) and 2008-09-19 (in the last modified column) is normal, that is the time it took to pull the files from the git, build the packages, test them and publish them.

==What's Next?==

There are no 2008.10 or 2008.11 releases. Openmoko set up an "Optimization team" led by John Lee to work on improving the distribution. The project last two months. No formal release was made in the end, even though the team considerably improved boot speed and fixed many bugs ([http://downloads.openmoko.org/distro/experimental/daily/ download directory]). The state of the tree at the end of the effort is summarized [http://lists.openmoko.org/nabble.html#nabble-f1954 here].

See [http://n2.nabble.com/No-more-optimization-team-tp1637861p1638039.html Openmoko's software roadmap] from December 2008 to mid 2009.
