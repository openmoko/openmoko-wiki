''Note : The following is far from being complete''


= The Filesystem =

== Openmoko 2007.2 ==

The Rootfilesystem consists out of the following directories:
*bin    
*dev
*home
*media
*proc
*sys
*usr
*boot
*etc
*lib
*mnt
*sbin
*tmp
*var


The first difference to the standard linux filesystem is that Openmoko lacks a /root directory.
This directory is located under /home/root/

Under /home/root/.evolution/ one can find the config and data files for contacts, calender, memos and tasks created on the Freerunner.

The file /home/root/.ash_history seems to have a false name; correct would be .bash_history.
