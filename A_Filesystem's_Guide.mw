== The Om 2008.8 filesystem ==

The root filesystem consists the following directories:

*bin    
*dev
*home
*media
*proc
*sys
*usr
*boot
*etc
*lib
*mnt
*sbin
*tmp
*var


The first difference to the standard Linux filesystem is the lack of /root directory. This directory is located under '''/home/root/'''.

Under '''/home/root/.evolution/''' one can find the config and data files for contacts, calender, memos and tasks created on the FreeRunner. This doesn't seem to be correct. See the discussion on [[Talk:A Filesystem's Guide|the talk page]].

The file '''/home/root/.ash_history''' is a history of commands for the standard shell (ash). If you use bash, it will create the file '''/home/root/.bash_history'''.

The inserted micro SD card is mounted under '''/media/card'''.
