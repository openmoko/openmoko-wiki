== Overview ==
PIM storage describes a means of storing data in an extensible and cross-referencable way. 

== Goals & Objectives ==
* Method to exchange data between all applications completely transparent
* Personal data security / encryption
* Great bidirectional sync of personal data
* Easy method for [[Backup|backup]] (ideally this should be automatic)
* Real-time incremental search
* Autocomplete of personal data information

== Use Cases ==
* I would like to attach arbitrary data to a contact (AKA: custom fields)
* I would like some level of integration with automatic switching of profiles. For example, it would be cool to automatically backup my personal data to my desktop PC when I get home.
* I want to type the first few numbers of a phone number and be presented a list of matching contacts.
** I'd rather take a person, choose home/work, choose land-line/mobile and not bother with numbers anymore. Useful when I'm on my way to meet that person, or the person has his/her birthday, i.e. the person is already listed on my screen!
* I want to add a contact to multiple groups (AKA: categories)
* I want to be able to send my contact info to other OpenMoko devices over bluetooth
* I want to be able to two-way sync all calendar, contacts (and tasks) with a GroupDAV server (e.g. Citadel) over-the-air

== Constraints ==
(TBD)

== Implementation Recommendations ==
* This will be based on [http://projects.o-hand.com/eds Embedded EDS], this way we will can directly use Evolution data, get OpenSync for free, and eventually be able to talk to a Microsoft Exchange Server using the Novell Connector.

== Interactions ==
* Embedded EDS needs libglade2, [[dbus]], and libdb.

== Unresolved Issues ==
* Synchronizing w/ Outlook
* Synchronizing w/ MacOS X - most Macs have bluetooth builtin and OSX addressbook supports BT sync.
* Synchronizing w/ Google services

Possible solutions:
* mokod - An OpenMoko daemon to run on host operating systems

== Questions and Answers ==
* Q: When will an Embedded EDS specification be available? i.e. How I can get applications to store and retrieve data from in it, in a compatible way?
* Q: Will it out of the box synchronize with the Kontact PIM suite (KDE)?
