== Overview ==
PIM storage describes a means of storing data in an extensible and cross-referencable way. 

== Goals & Objectives ==
* Method to exchange data between all applications completely transparent
* Personal data security / encryption
* Great bidirectional sync of personal data
* Easy method for backup (ideally this should be automatic)
* Real-time incremental search
* Autcomplete of personal data information

== Use Cases ==
* I would like to attach abritray data to a contact (AKA: custom fields)
* I would like some level of integration with automatic switching of profiles. For example, it would b e cool to automatically backup my personal data to my desktop PC when I get home.
* I want to type the first few numbers of a phone number and be presented a list of matching contacts.
* I want to add a contact to multiple groups

== Constraints ==
(TBD)

== Implementation Recommendations ==
* Usually a real database like SQLite might make a lot of sense here.
* Embedded EDS might be something to look into.

''* Libcontactsdb-0.4 might be a good idea for PIM storage, it based on SQLite.''
