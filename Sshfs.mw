== Using sshfs under OpenMoko ==

I assume that you have a working build environment

bitbake sshfs-fuse

Seems to build the required kernel module.<br>
'''However it fails to download the a source file'''
 NOTE: Task failed: Fetch failed: http://belnet.dl.sf.net/fuse/fuse-module-2.5.3.tar.gz

You can also get kernel module for from [[http://buildhost.openmoko.org/snapshots/2007.04/ipk/fic-gta01/kernel-module-fuse_2.6-moko9-r0_0_1754_0_fic-gta01.ipk kernel-module-fuse_2.6-moko9-r0_0_1754_0_fic-gta01.ipk]]

== Using sshfs to mount your phone filesystem on your host machine ===

Assuming you have added "moko" to /etc/hosts, and installed sshfs on the host:
  
 sshfs root@moko: /mnt/moko

It even works with dropbear!
