== Using sshfs under OpenMoko ==

I assume that you have a working build environment

bitbake sshfs-fuse

Seems to build the required kernel module.
'''However it fails to download the source for sshfs-fuse'''

You can also get kernel module for from [[http://buildhost.openmoko.org/snapshots/2007.04/ipk/fic-gta01/kernel-module-fuse_2.6-moko9-r0_0_1754_0_fic-gta01.ipk kernel-module-fuse_2.6-moko9-r0_0_1754_0_fic-gta01.ipk]]
