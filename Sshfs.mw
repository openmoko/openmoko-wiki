== Using sshfs under Openmoko ==

I assume that you have a working build environment

bitbake sshfs-fuse

Seems to build the required kernel module.<br>
'''However it fails to download the a source file'''
 NOTE: Task failed: Fetch failed: http://belnet.dl.sf.net/fuse/fuse-module-2.5.3.tar.gz

You can also get kernel module for from [http://buildhost.openmoko.org/snapshots/2007.04/ipk/fic-gta01/kernel-module-fuse_2.6-moko9-r0_0_1754_0_fic-gta01.ipk kernel-module-fuse_2.6-moko9-r0_0_1754_0_fic-gta01.ipk]

You can install sshfs directly from repositories, if you are a Ubuntu user you can use "'''apt-get install sshfs'''".

== Mounting phone filesystem on your host machine ==

In order to use a host name instead of the phone IP, you can add next line to /etc/hosts

 192.168.0.202   moko

Assuming you have added "moko" to /etc/hosts, and installed sshfs on the host:
  
 sshfs root@moko: /mnt/moko

That will mount root's home directory (/home/root) or you can specify another.

 e.g. root@moko:/

It actually works with dropbear, which is the default sshd on the Openmoko images.
