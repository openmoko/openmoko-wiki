Alternate case for the Neo1973, with an ambient light sensor mounted on the front.

==Concept==
The inclusion of an ambient light sensor allows the brightness of the screen to be automatically altered according to lighting conditions. This avoids excessive battery drain and intrusive light being emitted from the screen when in dark environments, and allows the screen to be viewed in brightly lit environments.
