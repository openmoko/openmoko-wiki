'''Literki''' is a full qwerty keyboard with configurable layout, always transparent, therefore applications don't need to redraw screens and popup is therefore very fast. The keys are big enough for everyday use with your fat fingers. To pop up the keyboard: slide your finger upwards from the bottom right corner. To hide the keyboard: slide your finger down on the keyboard. [http://www.opkg.org/package_232.html Opkg page]
