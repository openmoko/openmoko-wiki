'''Literki''' is a full qwerty keyboard with configurable layout, always transparent, therefore applications don't need to redraw screens and popup is therefore very fast. With literki comes the touchpad. With it use can use the bottom of the touchscreen to move a cursor around. You can then use left and right click with it. There are also four scroll buttons, which are useful if your application has very small scroll bars. [http://www.opkg.org/package_232.html Opkg page]
