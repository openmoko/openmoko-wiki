====='''Period YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD'''=====

Welcome to the YYYY-MM-DD edition of the Free Your Phone / Openmoko Community Updates. We are a loosely bound group of people originating from the developers and users of the pioneering Neo1973 and Neo FreeRunner products from Openmoko Inc. Nowadays most efforts are around free software distributions for a range of mobile phones, including the original Neo products. There are also several spin-off companies inspired by the Openmoko Inc's work.

Distributions lists releases and other significant updates in distributions that have some support for the Openmoko devices.
