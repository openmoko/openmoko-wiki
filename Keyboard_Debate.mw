== Summary of the problem ==

Om 2008.8 uses Qtopia for its phone stack. Qtopia has a build-in keyboard primarily designed to compose SMS in English. This keyboard is very impractical to use with a terminal or enter an URL.

== List of keyboard-related Howtos ==

=== How to use the Qtopia keyboard shipped with Om 2008.8 ? ===

Summary:
* Slide finger left = backspace.
* Slide finger right = space.
* Slide finger up/down = changes between lowercase/uppercase/numbers/special characters.
* The 'Enter' key is bottom right on the special characters page
* Hovering over a letter for more than 2 seconds activates zoom mode, allowing you to type specific letters without prediction. 
Detailed version: see [[Om_2008.8_Keyboard| How to use the Qtopia keyboard]].

=== How to have a toggle button to make the keyboard appear/disappear ? ===

Short answer: ''opkg install illume-config''.
Long answer: [[Keyboard Toggle|here]].

=== How to install the matchbox keyboard ? ===

Short answer: ''opkg install matchbox-keyboard-applet matchbox-keyboard-inputmethod''
Long answer: [[Switching_Keyboards|here]].

=== How to install the illume (Raster's) keyboard ? ===

Short answer (theoretical): wait until the ''illume-config-illume'' package arrives in the repository, then install it with ''opkg''.

Detailed answer:
 1. opkg install illume-config (Get the qwerty button if not there yet)
 2. add "export QTOPIA_NO_VIRTUAL_KEYBOARD=1" in /etc/X11/Xsession.d/89qtopia (Turn off buildin qtopia keyboard)
 3. opkg install -force-overwrite install http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/testing/all/illume-config-illume_0.0+svnr35693-r13_all.ipk
 4. echo 'E_PROFILE="-profile illume"' > /etc/enlightenment/default_profile (Switch to the illume profile from asu)
 5. rm -rf ~/.e/e/config/illume (Purge E's cache)
 6. /etc/init.d/xserver-nodm restart (Restart X)

Then switch keyboard from "None" to "Default" in Illume's preferences.

=== How to turn off the Qtopia keyboard ? ===

Short answer: Add the line ''export QTOPIA_NO_VIRTUAL_KEYBOARD=1'' into the file ''/etc/X11/Xsession.d/89qtopia''.

Warning: Even when you install another keyboard, if you do not turn off the Qtopia keyboard it will come back on the top <strike>to bite you trollishly</strike>. References:

=== How to change the keyboards layout ? ===

TBD

For illume: Install ''illume-keyboard-terminal'' package :) they are all recommended ones
for illume.

=== How to change the dictionary used by the predictive keyboards ? ===

The dictionary for the "standard" (qtopia) predictive keyboard is stored in ''/opt/Qtopia/etc/dict/<LANG>/words.dawg''. To change it, compile with ''dawgen'' an ispell dictionary (list of words) and replace the en-US words file. You can find an x86 binary ''dawgen'' executable  [http://www.3v1n0.net/openmoko/qtopia-italian-keyboard.tar.bz2 here].

For illume: TBD

Matchbox has no predictive mode (to be confirmed ?).

=== How to toggle the predictive mode on and off ? ===

TBD

=== How to make Qtopia keyboards and illume/raster keyboard coexist ? ===

TBD

== Your short-term options ==
[[Image:Assume_good_faith_lolcat.jpg|thumb|Even if things might look bad, you shouldn't assume that they are]]

* Turn off the Qtopia keyboard and install the matchbox one instead.
* Keep the Qtopia keyboard, let go (for a while) the desire to use the terminal locally, login remotely via ssh when you need.
* Get an external keyboard, USB or Bluetooth, light and foldable if you want.
* Switch to 2007.2 (but then similar issues arise : [[Switching Keyboards on Om 2007.2]]), FSO or Debian.
* Patch Qtopia so that it plays nice with other keyboards, send upstream, meanwhile recompile and provide a package.
PS: Complaining that management does not listen to the users needs is not a productive option.

== Perspectives for long-term resolution ==

On August 27th 2008, Marek from Openmoko inc. [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-August/028152.html announced] the intention to focus on the low-level layers. Future "base system" distribution may not include any phone stack at all.
