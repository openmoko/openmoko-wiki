== Summary of the problem ==

Om 2008.8 uses Qtopia for its phone stack. Qtopia has a build-in keyboard primarily designed to compose SMS in English. This keyboard is very impractical to use with a terminal or enter an URL.

[http://n2.nabble.com/preserving-illume-keyboard-on-update-tp778734p780454.html More details...], list of all [https://docs.openmoko.org/trac/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=in_testing&status=new&status=reopened&summary=~keyboard&order=priority keyboard bugs in the defect tracking system].

== List of available keyboards ==

=== Qtopia keyboard ===

The [[Om2008.8_Keyboard|Qtopia keyboard]] build-in Om 2008.8. See also the [[http://doc.trolltech.com/qtopia4.3/inputmethods-description.html documentation at Trolltech]]

=== Matchbox keyboard ===

The [[Switching_Keyboards_on_OM_2007.2#What_does_the_keyboard_look_like.3F|matchbox keyboard]]. [[Image:Complete_QWERTY_Keyboard_On_The_Freerunner_screenshot.png|none|thumb|260px|Screenshot of the keyboard applet on 2007.2]]

=== Illume keyboard ===

The illume virtual keyboard a.k.a. Raster's keyboard.

Probably [http://monochromementality.com/data/phoo/2008_08_05/medium/Screenshot-9.png looking like this]

See also [[Illume#Virtual_Keyboard]] (which would need to be completed ;)

=== Vkbd system ===

The vkbd system.

== List of keyboard-related Howtos ==

=== How to use the Qtopia keyboard shipped with Om 2008.8 ? ===

See [[Om_2008.8_Keyboard| How to use the Qtopia keyboard]].

=== How to have a toggle button to make the keyboard appear/disappear ? ===

[[Keyboard Toggle|here ?]]

=== How to change the keyboards layout ? ===

TBD

=== How to change the dictionary used by the predictive keyboards ? ===

TBD

=== How to toggle the predictive mode on and off ? ===

TBD

=== How to "turn off" Qtopia keyboard ? ===

By default, if illume keyboard is installed, it will compete with the qtopia one with non-predictable results on which one is displayed on top (correct me if I'm wrong).

According to [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1864| Comment on ticket 1864]: You can put "export QTOPIA_NO_VIRTUAL_KEYBOARD=1" into  /etc/X11/Xsession.d/89Qtopia and qpe will not instantiate a virtual keyboard and illume's keyboard should be shown. 

Another option involves [http://n2.nabble.com/preserving-illume-keyboard-on-update-tp778734p778919.html patching and recompiling qpe].

=== How to make Qtopia keyboards and illume/raster keyboard coexist ? ===

TBD

== Your short-term options ==
[[Image:Assume_good_faith_lolcat.jpg|thumb|Even if things might look bad, you shouldn't assume that they are]]

* Live with it, let go (for a while) the desire to use the terminal locally, login remotely via ssh when you need.
* Get an external keyboard, USB or Bluetooth, light and foldable if you want.
* Switch to 2007.2 (but then similar issues arise : [[Switching Keyboards on Om 2007.2]]), FSO or Debian.
* Recompile Qtopia and provide a package.
PS: Complaining that management does not listen to the users needs is not a productive option.

== Perspectives for long-term resolution ==

On August 27th 2008, Marek from Openmoko inc. [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-August/028152.html announced] the intention to focus on the low-level layers. Future "base system" distribution may not include any phone stack at all.
