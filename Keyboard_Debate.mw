== Summary of the problem ==

Om 2008.8 uses Qtopia for its phone stack. Qtopia has a build-in keyboard primarily designed to compose SMS in English. This keyboard is very impractical to use with a terminal or enter an URL. [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/support/2008-August/002184.html| According to Raster] it cannot be turned off, [http://n2.nabble.com/preserving-illume-keyboard-on-update-tp778734p778919.html| short of recompiling qpe] of course.

== Perspectives for long-term resolution ==

On August 27th 2008, Openmoko inc. announced its intention to focus on the low-level layers. Future "base system" distribution may not include any phone stack at all.
