== History ==

Sean Moss-Pultz (CEO of Openmoko Inc.) decided that the best path foreword for the phone business is to turn the future of the Freerunner over to the community. (See the [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2009-June/048903.html announce] for all details)

In brief :
* The Neo Freerunner developpment is now fully holded by the [[Gta02-core]] project
* The community has permission to use the Openmoko brand/trademark for their efforts
* Openmoko Inc. will continue to provide funding for operating the infrastructure (Wiki, GIT, Trac, Planet, ...)



== Wish List ==

List here for what kinds of things OM can do to smooth this transition.
* continue to funding the infrastructure
* promote and sell the Freerunner
* create the Openmoko foundation ?
