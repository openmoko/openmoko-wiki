== History ==

Sean Moss-Pultz (CEO of Openmoko Inc.) decided that the best path forward for the phone business is to turn the future of the Freerunner over to the community. (See the [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2009-June/048903.html announcement] for details)

In brief :
* The Neo Freerunner development is now fully performed by the [[Gta02-core]] project
* The community has permission to use the Openmoko brand/trademark for their efforts
* Openmoko Inc. will continue to provide funding for operating the infrastructure (Wiki, GIT, Trac, Planet, ...)

== Wish List ==

List here for what kinds of things OM can do to smooth this transition.
* continue to funding the infrastructure
* promote and sell the Freerunner
* create the Openmoko foundation ?

These are the [https://docs.openmoko.org/trac/milestone/stable-kernel-2009.1 most important bugs] that need to be fixed now.

There is a current ongoing effort to get basic GTA02 support in the mainstream Linux kernel, the patches have been sent. Once this basic support is ready other drivers can be submitted as well. Many of the drivers need additional work to be suitable for upstream inclusion.
