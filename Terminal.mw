Terminal {{Application}}

Command line terminal is a vital tool in all Linux installations, so is on Openmoko smartphones.

[[Vala-terminal]]

== openmoko-terminal2 ==

The [[Om 2008.8]] (and Om 2008.9 update) does not have a terminal application pre-installed, but the '''openmoko-terminal2''' is available in the default package sources.

To install it, after configuring some kind of networking like for example [[USB Networking]] or [[Wifi]], you can use the software installer on the bottom of the screen, or type this one the phone via SSH connection

opkg install openmoko-terminal2

To have a "terminal friendly keyboard", install the '''illume-config''' package and reboot. Clicking the strange icon at the new keyboard's corner will let you choose "Terminal" layout. See also [[Om 2008.8 Keyboard]] and [[Keyboard_Debate]].

Daniel Willmann responded: Yeah, openmoko-terminal2 was broken for some time. Mickey fixed it (now
renamed to vala-terminal), but too late for milestone4 which included a
working gpe-terminal instead.
