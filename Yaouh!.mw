==Introduction==
Yaouh! (Yet Another Osm Updater H) is an utility for update maps of TangoGPS. It check the md5 of remote file and of local file, if is different update the file.
It read the TangoGPS config file for know where is store the file of the maps. For now support only OSM maps.

==Installation==

 opkg install http://minucci.net/file/opkg/yaouh_0.2.1_all.opk

Or you can use repository http://minucci.net/file/opkg/ . For add repository follow this command:

 cd /etc/opkg
 wget http://minucci.net/file/gecco-feed.conf

and then:

 opkg update
 opkg install yaouh

===experimental===

I enhanced the code a bit (support for other maps, also inverted):

yaouh0.3_experimental.py [http://www.logic.at/people/kelvan/yaouh0.3_experimental.py]

it needs the shell at the moment (I'm not really good in gui things ;)) and it is possible to start a second update-process (not beautiful to see the progress bar flickering)

==Bug==

Todo
