==Distributions==
{{DistributionBox|
Name=QtMoko|
Description=QtMoko is debian distribution for Openmoko Freerunner phone. Phone and user interface is based on QT Extendeded formerly known as Qtopia. This should be best QtMoko image. We have all Freerunner hardware working (with some small glitches) and also as phone it should be very usable. Now we have growing number of packages in qtmoko-apps repository and also it is possible to endless packages from Debian. There seems to be still bug with sometimes lost SMS messages. It would be great if someone managed to find out how to reproduce this issue or send AT log. This can be either kernel bug (phone does not wake up and the operator gives up on delivering message?) or something in Qtopia (the message arrives but gets lost) or combination of these two. Changes from previous version:
* Fixed no sound in incoming calls
* Fixed wifi - now should work ok (many thanks to Paul Ferster)
* New package repository [1] and package feed [2] (thanks to Ant)
* Improved fonts - using now truetype fonts which can handle diacritics and look better. In terminal it's now possible to set fixed size font.
* Fixes in QtMaze (thanks to Ant)
* Improved look - using now icons instead of text
* Improved speed for switching alsa scenarios
* Added script for sharing GPRS connection with PC
* Disabled dimming by default when on cable
* Upgraded kernel to latest andy-tracking
<br>So enjoy, thanks to everyone who helped with this release and let Radek Polak know how you like it.|
