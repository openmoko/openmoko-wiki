=== CALYPSO ASIC digital baseband ===
Unfortunately we cannot provide many details on the GSM chipset due to very tight [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement NDA]s.  However, this is not neccessarily required, since it interfaces using a standard UART serial line with the S3C2442.  On that interface, [http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/07_series/07.05/ GSM 07.05], [http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/07_series/07.10/ GSM 07.10] and other standardized protocols are used.

The NDAd documentation for the calypso, [http://cryptome.org/ti-calypso1.pdf register definition ] and [http://cryptome.org/ti-calypso2.pdf hardware definition ] was leaked onto a public forum on the 4th of March by persons or persons unknown.

== Vibrator ==
* Driver: https://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/src/target/kernel/patches/gta01-vibrator.patch
* Connected to: S3C2442 GPIO

== USB Host ==
The USB Host controller is inside the S3C2442
* Driver: Stock Linux kernel ohci_hcd
* USB version 1.1
* Supply USB 5v in Host mode using usb power switch AAT1275IRN-5.0-T1
** http://www.analogictech.com/products/digitalfiles/AAT1275.pdf
* A net EN_USBHOST is controlled by PMU GPIO "GPO", this one signal when asserted (high)
** enables generation of 5V for external device using a charge pump
** enables connection of 15K pulldowns to D+ and D- to allow device insertion and removal detection for host mode
** DISABLES the path for USB power to charge the battery

It should also be possible to use host mode with externally-provided
power. This will allow the FreeRunner to be connected to a USB device
and be powered and charging the battery if present at the same
time. This method is called the Y-cable and was invented by [[User:JOERG|Joerg Reisenweber]]. For
additional info and circuit diagrams see
[[Specialized_USB_cables#How_to_make_a_USB_cable_for_powering_attached_USB_devices_and_charging_the_Neo_while_in_host_mode_.28aka_Y-Cable.29|Specialized
USB Cables]].

* Connect 0V, d+, d-, +5 to your USB device
* Connect a 15k ohm resistor between d+ and ground
* Connect a 15k ohm resistor between d- and ground
* Connect 0V, +5 to your >1A power source
** If your power source was not the Openmoko 1A charger, additionally connect a 47K ohm 5% resistor between the ID pin and ground to pretend to be the 1A charger.

In addition you need to make sure EN_USBHOST signal that enables the physical Host mode power generation and disables the USB -> PMU charging path is deasserted.  This may be taken care of automatically shortly by detection of the 48K resistor on a USB insertion leading to forcing EN_USBHOST deasserted.  The charge pump that generates the 5V in host mode doesn't seem to mind getting external 5V given to it, but the real issue is that the battery will not be charged at all if we leave EN_USBHOST asserted since one of its jobs is to stop that happening.

== USB Device ==
The USB Device controller is inside the S3C2442
* Driver: https://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/src/target/kernel/patches/s3c2410_udc.patch
* Please see [[USB Product IDs]] on information about which Vendor/Product IDs we use

== I2C Devices ==
I2C is a simple communication standard intended to move small amounts of data a few inches between chips.
Please see [[I2C | Neo I2C Devices]] for more information & a list of devices & the addresses currently in use & documented for the Neo1973.<br>

== Audio ==

== Case ==
The case for the FreeRunner is all black, as seen on the front page of the wiki.

Openmoko has released the CAD files for the case of the Neo1973 and Neo FreeRunner.  These were created using Pro/ENGINEER (also called Pro/E).  They are available in the Pro/E (.asm/.prt) format, but alternative formats are also available.


We welcome your assistance in providing other formats. If you are able to convert CAD files from Pro/E format to other formats, please contact [mailto:michael@openmoko.org]. We are especially interested in the DXF format and in images rendered from these files.

* ATAG_REVISION: 0310

== GTA02v2 ==
Second generation of prototypes, Total 50 pcs run at Taipei SMT factory MOUNT

*Ideal is have 256 MB NAND on Samsung package, Due to chip availability Start using S3C2442 B43
*Using correct PMU PCF50633 04 N3
*Change new SIM socket
*Change to u-blox A-GPS
*Change LCM power from 3.3v to 1.8v
*USB power switch layout/pin assignment mistake, could not verify USB host supply 5v function
*GPS function verified ok with good sensitivity
* ATAG_REVISION: 0320

== GTA02v3 ==
Production verification version, 2007/10/11 28 pcs fabricate at FIC SuZhou

*Still using S3C2442 B43 for hardware verification
*Using control pilot run to verify S3C2442 B54 chips<br>
* ATAG_REVISION: 0330

== GTA02v4 ==
Mass production release candidate version 1

2 weeks after v3 gerber out, release the v4 gerber, and 2007/10/20 20 pcs fabricate at FIC SuZhou

*Change LCM power from 1.8v to 3.3v for display stability issue
*fabricate another 200 pcs for yield rate/production verification
*fabricate 50 pcs with S3C2442 B43 (128 MB NAND) for quality comparsion
*USB host power chip have some output voltage stability issues with Vb/Vcc comes from different power source, need layout change to fix the issue
*Battery Coulomb design not working on A4
* ATAG_REVISION: 0340

== GTA02v5 ==
Mass production candidate version 2/Mass production version

* First batch fabricate 2008/1/14 at FIC SuZhou
* Mass production A5 trial run start from 2008 March, including some resistor/capacitor change compare with inital 100 pcs prototypes A5, and prototypes for GTA02 developers was tracked in the [[Prototypes| Prototypes Page]]
* Coulomb counter issue fixed
* USB host power switch fixed
* Need add capacitor for PMU Vbat input for stability issue, this could be done by direct SMT or hand rework
* Need rework (still using SMT in production) add capacitor for PMU Vbat input for PMU stability issue.
* Need manual rework GSM IR UART path a 100k pull down for better GSM deep sleep
* ATAG_REVISION: 0350

===GTA02 mass Production version change list===
*PMU's LED power error: PMU potential damage issue
*NOR FLASH enable WP: User can write data into NOR FLASH.
*CE CS/RS fine tune: Audio's background noise too high
*I2C pull high resistor: The resistor is too high and signal is distorted
*GSM leakage current: TX_MODEM has a pull high resistor on IO_3V3
*Power consumption: Disable keep active function
*SDIO clock and esd protect resistor
*Refer to Datasheet: R1526 to 33K
*GSM modem on pin: The R1018 is too small and has some leakage current
*LED driving transistor: When GPIO is on, the transistor will be draw more current on LED. This is component change fix, do not need change PCB or re-work.

== GTA02v6 ==
Mass production candidate version 3/Mass production version<br>

A6 will be fine tune version of A5, only minor [http://downloads.openmoko.org/schematics/GTA02/ schematic] change for better product quality and version control. Capacitor and resistor change A6 also on mass production A5<br>

*First 100 pcs start from 2008 mid April, and factory make component placement mistake on GSM, second 100 pcs PCB arrive time TBD.
*Add capacitor space for Vbat, reduce the SMT effort
*Add GSM IR resistor for better GSM deep sleep
*Reserve 3 GPIO for hardware version control
*Fixed LEDs power usage (from about 150mW of v5 to about 25mW)
* ATAG_REVISION: 0360

=== GTA02 A5 to A6 changes ===
*Power Glitch on VB_SYS: Add capacitor on layout, Mass production A5 also apply this change.
*G-sensor separate these interrupt pins: At A5, each accelerometer INT1/INT2 connected to same line, at A6 only INT1 was connected.
*GSM_modem power source  Reduce power's ripple when the phone is talking
*Keep active 	Disable keep active function, just fine tune
*GPIO for version control
*GSM RX_IR has some noise  Add resistor and reduce GSM RX_IR noise and gsm can't enter suspend mode easily, apply on mass production A5.
*LED driving transistor	apply on mass production A5.
*LCM's VDDIO	We can totally power off LCM's power, save about extra 1mA.

= Distinguishing hardware revisions =
== Inside the [[Bootloader]] ==
Every hardware revision has its own u-boot image type.  Thus, the bootloader has the revision hard-coded.
The hardware revision is passed on to the kernel via the ATAG mechanism (ATAG_REVISION)

== Inside the [[Kernel]] ==
The kernel receives the ATAG_REVISION during bootup, and saves its contents in the "system_rev" global variable.

== From Userspace ==
The kernel exports the system_rev variable in /proc/cpuinfo as "Revision :" line.
