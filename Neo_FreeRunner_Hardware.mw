[[OpenMoko]] is a software distribution stack that sits on top of a [[hardware]] platform.  The [[Neo FreeRunner]] phone is the second hardware platform to take advantage of OpenMoko.  You can find specifics of the hardware by reviewing this introduction page and the pages in the category as shown at the bottom of this page.

{{note|This page is about hardware that is currently in '''design/prototype''' phase, changes are frequent}}

== History ==

=== GTA02v1 ===
First generation of prototypes that was given to internal OpenMoko software developers. Total 30 pcs fabricated.

*It is working just fine, but still based on 2440, with external NAND/SDRAM and no NOR flash
*Using the PCF50633 05 N3 due to 04 N3 not available, re-work power for basic schematics verification
*Using GTA01 SIM socket
*Add external debug port
*Still using Global locate A-GPS

* ATAG_REVISION: FIXME

=== GTA02v2 ===
Second generation of prototypes, Total 50 pcs run at Taipei SMT factory MOUNT

*Ideal is have 256 MB NAND on Samsung package, Due to chip availability Start using S3C2442 B43
*Using correct PMU PCF50633 04 N3
*Change new SIM socket
*Change to u-blox A-GPS
*Change LCM power from 3.3v to 1.8v
*USB power switch layout/pin assignment mistake, could not verify USB host supply 5v function
*GPS function verified ok with good senstivity

=== GTA02v3 ===
Production verification version, 2007/10/11 28 pcs fabricate at FIC SuZhou

*Still using S3C2442 B43 for hardware verification
*Using control pilot run to verify S3C2442 B54 chips<br>

=== GTA02v4 ===
Mass production release candicate version 1

2 weeks after v3 gerber out, release the v4 gerber, and 2007/10/20 20 pcs fabricate at FIC SuZhou 

*Change LCM power from 1.8v to 3.3v for display stability issue
*fabricate another 200 pcs for yield rate/production verification
*fabricate 50 pcs with S3C2442 B43 (128 MB NAND) for quality comparsion
*USB host power chip have some output voltage stability issues with Vb/Vcc comes from different power source, need layout change to fix the issue
*Battery Coulomb design not working on A4

=== GTA02v5 ===
Mass production candicate version 2/Mass production version

*First batch fabricate 2008/1/14 at FIC SuZhou
*Coulomb counter issue fixed
*USB host power switch fixed
*Need add capacitor for PMU Vbat input for stability issue, this could be done by direct SMT or hand rework
* First batch of prototypes for GTA02 developers was tracked in [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Prototypes Prototypes page]

=== Debug Connector ===

* 16 - SPI_MOSI0
* 15 - SPI-MISO0 
* 14 - SS0
* 13 - EINT3 (H-TP4705)
* 3 - CONSOLE_TXD (H-TP4701)
* 2 - CONSOLE_RXD (H-TP4702)

Information from [http://people.openmoko.org/roh/Debugport_GTA01bv4.png].

== Distinguishing hardware revisions ==
=== Inside the [[Bootloader]] ===
Every hardware revision has its own u-boot image type.  Thus, the bootloader has the revision hard-coded.
The hardware revision is passed on to the kernel via the ATAG mechanism (ATAG_REVISION)

=== Inside the [[Kernel]] ===
The kernel receives the ATAG_REVISION during bootup, and saves its contents in the "system_rev" global variable.

=== From Userspace ===
The kernel exports the system_rev variable in /proc/cpuinfo as "Revision :" line.

=== Certification ===

*FCC
** 850/1800/1900 Band, FCC ID: EUNGTA02
** 900/1800/1900 Bnad, FCC ID: EUNGTA02E
