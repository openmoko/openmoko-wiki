[[OpenMoko]] is a software distribution stack that sits on top of a [[hardware]] platform.  The [[Neo1973|Neo1973 GTA02]] phone is the first hardware platform to take advantage of OpenMoko.  You can find specifics of the [[:Category:Neo1973 Hardware | Neo1973 Hardware]] by reviewing this introduction page and the pages in the category as shown at the bottom of this page.

== History ==

=== GTA02v1 ===

It is working just fine, but still based on 2440, with external NAND/SDRAM and no NOR flash

* ATAG_REVISION: FIXME

=== GTA02v2 ===
Second generation of prototypes

FIXME

=== Debug Connector ===

This is the connector used to connect the [[Debug Board]] and possibly other hardware.

Connections are:
* 39 - GND
* 38 - STDI
* 37 - _RESET
* 36 - STMS
* 35 - STCK
* 34 - STDO
* 33 - GSM_EN
* 29 - _STRST
* 19 - X_I2C_SCL (H-TP4703)
* 18 - X_I2C_SDA (H-TP4704)
* 17 - SPI_CLK0
* 16 - SPI_MOSI0
* 15 - SPI-MISO0 
* 14 - SS0
* 13 - EINT3 (H-TP4705)
* 3 - CONSOLE_TXD (H-TP4701)
* 2 - CONSOLE_RXD (H-TP4702)

Information from [http://people.openmoko.org/roh/Debugport_GTA01bv4.png].

== Distinguishing hardware revisions ==
=== Inside the [[Bootloader]] ===
Every hardware revision has its own u-boot image type.  Thus, the bootloader has the revision hard-coded.
The hardware revision is passed on to the kernel via the ATAG mechanism (ATAG_REVISION)

=== Inside the [[Kernel]] ===
The kernel receives the ATAG_REVISION during bootup, and saves its contents in the "system_rev" global variable.

=== From Userspace ===
The kernel exports the system_rev variable in /proc/cpuinfo as "Revision :" line.

== Approval ==
TBD
