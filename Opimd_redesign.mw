This page will gather all the suggestions (and will be a decent design sketch) for the redesign of opimd. After many discussions in IRC we decided opimd needs a redesign.

Main topics that came up are: switching opimd to use sqlite for internal operations and adding configuration for types instead of the use of URIs. Many of the ideas that came up concerning the second idea are represented in this IRC log: http://pastebin.com/mb7fbf10 and in the logs from #openmoko-cdevel@Freenode on 09-10 of october 2009.

Furthermore, it has been suggested than a change in the sqlite backend db design is also needed.


Info about those changes will be shown here as soon as we'll have time to write it down.
