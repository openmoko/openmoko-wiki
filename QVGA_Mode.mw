Information on getting into QVGA mode successfully

=== SHR === 

On SHR-unstable (as of the Sept 2009 builds) the following worked.

Create two new scripts - I put these in /usr/local/bin, and added /usr/local/bin to my PATH in my .profile file - but you can put 'em where ever you like, as long as they are on your PATH, or you use the full path to invoke 'em.

qvga:
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
echo "qvga-normal" > /sys/bus/spi/devices/spi2.0/state
xrandr -s 240x320
fbset 240x320             
killall -HUP enlightenment
</pre>

normal:
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
echo "normal" > /sys/bus/spi/devices/spi2.0/state
xrandr -s 480x640
killall -HUP enlightenment
</pre>

and add to /etc/fb.modes
<pre>
mode "240x320"
       geometry 240 420 240 320 16
       timings 100000 8 88 2 2 8 2
       accel false
endmode
</pre>

This usually creates a usable display - although occasionally enlightnment get confused and crashes.

Unfortunately there's a problem with the touchscreen, so the upper quarter of the screen maps to the entire screen, so using this for anything real isn't possible.   Apparently this is fixed in the Xorg based X server, which should be available soon, so hopefully this will be resolved soon.
