On SHR-unstable (as of the july 2011 (openembedded)builds) the following worked.

Create two new scripts - I put these in /usr/local/bin, and added /usr/local/bin to my PATH in my .profile file - but you can put 'em where ever you like, as long as they are on your PATH, or you use the full path to invoke 'em.

qvga:
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
xrandr -dpi 143
echo "qvga" > /sys/bus/spi/devices/spi2.0/resolution
xrandr -s 240x320
killall -HUP enlightenment
</pre>

normal:
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
xrandr -dpi 280
echo "vga" > /sys/bus/spi/devices/spi2.0/resolution
xrandr -s 480x640
killall -HUP enlightenment
</pre>
