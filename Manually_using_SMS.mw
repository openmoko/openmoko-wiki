This article explains how to send and receive [[SMS]] messages over [[Gsm | GSM]] using the [[Neo1973_Hardware#GSM.2FGPRS | GSM hardware]] in the [[Neo1973]].

If you're well versed in SMS, please review the SMS commands and update them (and remove this paragraph).  I've done what I could with a single evening's crash course.

If you just want to do this without reading any background, skip directly to Setup.

== Overview ==
The GSM hardware in the Neo1973 uses an extended version of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayes_command_set Hayes AT command set] for sending and receiving messages.  Documentation on this command set can be found in the [http://www.ctiforum.com/standard/standard/etsi/0705.pdf GSM Technical Specification] at CTI Forum.  Since technical specs are usually referenced for the finer details and the final word, I recommend reading through the [http://www.developershome.com/sms/ SMS documentation] at Developer's Home instead.

== libgsmd-tool ==
Though issuing the commands to [[gsmd | Gsmd]] via [[Gsmd#libgsmd-tool | libgsmd-tool]] seems to work properly, gsmd would complain about "unsolicited responses" when reading back a list of SMS messages.  This would happen when multiple messages needed to be read, then sent back to libgsmd-tool.  It probably works properly when retrieving a single message.  This problem showed itself by libgsmd-tool displaying duplicate messages, or not displaying response lines.

For this reason, I recommend using [http://linux.die.net/man/1/cu cu], a program used to "call up" another computer.  If you have trouble using cu, you may want to refer to the article about [[manually using GSM]] for more information.

== Setup ==
The article on [[manually using GSM]] goes through the process of making sure no other process was accessing the GSM modem device, then setting up the system for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUCP UUCP] locking so cu can set up locking for the GSM modem device.  Personal experience with the Neo is that the directories for UUCP locking are already set up, and that stopping gsmd is sufficient.  Again, if you have any problems, refer to the [[manually using GSM]] article for additional setup details.

=== Stop the GSM Daemon ===
This ensures gsmd is not using the GSM modem and will not interfere with your hacking.

<pre>
root@fic-gta01:~$ /etc/init.d/gsmd stop 
Shutting down gsmd: Terminated
</pre>

=== Reset the GSM Modem ===
This can be done by powering off, then powering back on the modem.  It is inferred this can be done by the [[Manually_using_GSM#Powering_up_the_GSM_Modem | Powering up the GSM Modem]] section of the manually using GSM article.  If anyone can validate, or add the proper procedure, please update here.

<pre>
root@fic-gta01:~$ echo 0 > /sys/bus/platform/devices/gta01-pm-gsm.0/power_on
root@fic-gta01:~$ echo 1 > /sys/bus/platform/devices/gta01-pm-gsm.0/power_on
</pre>

Is there a location in /proc where one can verify the state of the GSM modem?

== Connect to the GSM Device ==
Use cu to connect to the GSM device at /dev/ttySAC0.  At this point, if you have a typing mistake, don't use the [Backspace] or [Delete] key to correct it.  Use [Ctrl-H].

<pre>
root@fic-gta01:~$ cu -l /dev/ttySAC0
Connected.
AT-Command Inter
</pre>

Verify your connection by typing "AT" followed by [Enter] a few times.  You should eventually get an "OK" response.

<pre>
root@fic-gta01:~$ cu -l /dev/ttySAC0
Connected.
AT-Command Inter
OK
AT
OK
</pre>

== GSM Modem Setup ==
At this point, the GSM modem has been reset and you are connected to it.  You'll need to connect to the network and configure SMS test mode by issuing a few commands.

I am unable to send/receive SMS consistently without issuing all of the following commands every time start up.

=== Turn on Echo ===
Turning on echo lets you see what you're doing.  This is done using the "ATE1" command.

<pre>
ATE1
OK
</pre>

=== Miscellaneous Setup ===
Depending on your SIM card and your country, the following commands may not be sufficient for you.  For a T-Mobile SIM card in the United States, these instructions are adequate.  For a PIN enabled SIM card, you may need to use the AT+CPIN="<PIN #>" command or in another country, you may need to enter an SMS Center with the AT+CSCA command.

If you find you need additional setup, please help everyone else by documenting it on this page.

=== Power Up the GSM Modem ===
Power up the GSM modem using "AT+CFUN=1".

<pre>
AT+CFUN=1
OK
</pre>

The best reference I've found for this command are the commands in gsmd (usock.c).  According to the code, the GSM modem can be turned off and on using the "AT+CFUN" command.  Refer to [[Manually_using_SMS#Reset the GSM Modem|Reset the GSM Modem]] to see how this is apparently accomplished from the command line.

To power down the modem:
<pre>
AT+CFUN=0
OK
</pre>

Reference: Source code for gsmd - usock.c
Reference: [[Hardware:AT_Commands#Section_8.2C_Mobile_Termination_control_and_status_commands | Mobile Termination Control and Status Commands]]

=== Register with the GSM Network ===
Use "AT+COPS" to ensure you are connected to a GSM network.

You may receive a variety of responses depending on the current state of the GSM modem.  This command makes sure you are connected to a provider.
<pre>
AT+COPS
OK
</pre>

To check the current GSM network, use "AT+COPS?".

<pre>
AT+COPS?
+COPS: 0,0,"T - Mobile"
</pre>

=== SMS Text Mode ===
Select SMS text mode with the "AT+CMGF=1" command.  Note that the goal of gsmd seems to be to make use of the SMS PDU (protocol data unit) mode which is better for programming.  However, use text mode here as it makes sending and receiving messages possible by mere humans.

<pre>
AT+CMGF=1
OK
</pre>

== Send SMS ==
To send an SMS, use the "AT+CMGS="<Phone #>"" command. You will be prompted for text with a ">" prompt.  Enter your text message and press [Enter].  Hit <Ctrl-Z> to signal the end of your text.  The message will be sent on its way.

<pre>
AT+CMGS="5555551212"
> HOWDY
> <Ctrl-Z>
OK
</pre>

== Receive SMS ==
Send an SMS to your Neo from an Internet service or another phone.  On your Neo, retrieve all your messages using the "AT+CMGL="ALL"" command.  It should be the last one listed.

<pre>
AT+CMGL="ALL"

OK
</pre>

To retrieve unread messages, use "AT+CMGL="REC UNREAD"".

<pre>
AT+CMGL="REC UNREAD"
...
OK
</pre>

To retrieve read messages, use "AT+CMGL="REC READ"".

<pre>
AT+CMGL="REC READ"
...
OK
</pre>

There are other commands for retrieving messages.  Learn by reading through the references at your leisure.

== Final ==
To exit cu, use "~.". Note that ssh also uses this escape sequence to disconnect a connection, so you may need to type "~~." into your terminal to produce a "~." on the other end. 

There are commands for deleting and storing messages, as well.  Learn more about these by reading through the references listed throughout this page.
