NeoPlay is a homemade USB gamepad for Openmoko smartphones. It is tiny and thin. The electronical part is based on [http://www.raphnet.net/ Raphaël Assénat]'s [http://www.raphnet.net/electronique/usb_game12/index_en.php "USB game controller with 12 inputs"] and uses the same firmware. The frame of the construction was made from several pieces of plastic and covered by a cloth. Now Neo should beat Gizmondo and Tapwave Zodiac :D
