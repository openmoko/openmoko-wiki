==Installing Zhone on Ubuntu ==

{{Warning|Adding those repositories (or the zhone installation?) may lead to problems on a Kubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron.
Many packages update are done at the same time (200+ changes), and something break the upgrade.
Removing repositories and launching an "apt-get -f install" fix the problem.
