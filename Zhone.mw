==Zen Phone==

Screenshots: [[FSO UI Tutorial]]

Zhone is often told to be a demo application for the free softphone framework (FSO). But it actually is a quite usable phone program that allows to send and receive calls, SMS messages and tells you your gps coordinates. The FSO automagically detects when the gps coordinates are no more shown and shuts down the GPS hardware as long as it is not needed.

Since it mainly only sends commands over dbus to the daemons that actually do the work it is rather stable and even able to do multitasking like allowing you to read an SMS whilst using the phone.

==Installing Zhone on Ubuntu ==

{{Warning|Adding those repositories (or the zhone installation?) may lead to problems on a Kubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron.
Many packages update are done at the same time (200+ changes), and something break the upgrade.
Removing repositories and launching an "apt-get -f install" fix the problem.
