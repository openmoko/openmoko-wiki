==Zen Phone==

Screenshots: [[FSO UI Tutorial]]

Zhone is often told to be a demo application for the free softphone framework (FSO). But it actually is a quite usable phone program that allows to send and receive calls, SMS messages and tells you your gps coordinates. The FSO automagically detects when the gps coordinates are no more shown and shuts down the GPS hardware as long as it is not needed.

Since it mainly only sends commands over dbus to the daemons that actually do the work it is rather stable and even able to do multitasking like allowing you to read an SMS whilst using the phone.

==Using VCF within Zhone==
Arne sent a small [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/support/2009-January/004394.html patch] that imports phone numbers from a VCF 3.0 address book. Since Zhone has problems with numbers -, the patch below is a sligthly different and removes -.

In /usr/bin/zhone search for ''class pyphone_contacts(edje_group)''
and modify the prepare function:

    def prepare( self ):
        if not self.ready and not self.busy:
            file = open(os.environ.get('HOME')+"/addressbook.vcf", "r")
            entries = []
            entry_nr = 1
            name = None
            number = None
            for line in file:
                #if line.startswith("END:VCARD"):
                if line.startswith("TEL;"):
                    number = unicode(line.partition(":")[2].strip())
                    number = number.replace('-','')
                    if name and number:
                        entry = entry_nr, name, number
                        entries.append(entry)
                        entry_nr = entry_nr + 1
                if line.startswith("END:VCARD"):
                    name = None
                    number = None
                if line.startswith("N:"):
                    name = unicode(line.partition(":")[2].replace(';',' ').strip(), "utf8", "utf8")
                #if line.startswith("TEL;"):
                #    number = unicode(line.partition(":")[2].strip())
            file.close()
            self.cbPhonebookReply(entries)
 
            """

                self.busy = True
            else:

==Installing Zhone on Ubuntu ==

{{Warning|Adding those repositories (or the zhone installation?) may lead to problems on a Kubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron.
Many packages update are done at the same time (200+ changes), and something break the upgrade.
Removing repositories and launching an "apt-get -f install" fix the problem.
}}

*Add this to your /etc/apt/sources.lst :
 deb http://pkg-fso.alioth.debian.org/debian/ unstable main
 deb-src http://pkg-fso.alioth.debian.org/debian/ unstable main
 deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ experimental main
 deb http://e17.dunnewind.net/ubuntu hardy e17
*Execute:
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install zhone
* remove this from your /etc/apt/sources.lst
 deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ experimental main
* Now you can finally execute:
 zhone

== Developing Zhone ==
* Install Zhone see [[Zhone#Installing Zhone on Ubuntu]]
* apt-get source zhone
