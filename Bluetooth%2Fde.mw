Bluetooth is the wireless local connectivity standard supported by current [[Openmoko]] and [[Neo1973]].

== Applications ==

There is a non-functioning panel applet [[Bluetooth Connection Status]].

For now, see [[Manually using Bluetooth]], which also explains pand networking for setting up a tcp/ip over bluetooth.

Take two Neos and shake them together => the synchronized shake establishes a safe Bluetooth connection between the two devices.
