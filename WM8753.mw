'''WM8753''' (also the '''Wolfson Codec''') is the "sound card" chip in the [[Neo1973 audio subsystem]]. It has a stereo ADC for recording and a stereo DAC for playback, plus a mono "voice" DAC.

It's connected to the [[S3C2410]] IIS interface for PCM "hi-fi" data, and to the S3C2410 [[I2C]] interface for control. The PCM "voice" input and output is connected to the [[Bluetooth]] chip. The stereo output ("Audio Out": LOUT1 and ROUT1) is connected to [[LM4857]] stereo input (LIN and RIN) for amplification. MONO1 and MONO2 form "GSM Line Out"; RXP and RXN form "GSM Line In". MIC1 is "Headset Mic", and MIC2 is "Call Mic".

The following output pins are not connected: LOUT2 and ROUT2, OUT3, OUT4. The following input pins are not connected: LINE1, LINE2.

There are several sources connected via switches that can cut each source out:
* "Left Mixer Left" and "Right Mixer Right Playback Switch" connect the stereo DAC for stereo mixing.
* "Mono Mixer Left" and "Mono Mixer Right Playback Switch" connect the  stereo DAC for mono mixing.
* XXX bypass, sidetone, voice
