'''WM8753''' (also the '''Wolfson Codec''') is the "sound card" chip in the [[Neo1973 audio subsystem]]. 

It's connected to the [[S3C2410]] IIS interface for PCM data, and to the S3C2410 [[I2C]] interface for control. The stereo output (LOUT1 and ROUT1) is connected to [[LM4857]] stereo input (LIN and RIN) for amplification.

== Routing ==

There are several sources connected via switches that can cut each source out:
* "Left Mixer Left" and "Right Mixer Right Playback Switch" connect the stereo DAC for stereo mixing.
* "Mono Mixer Left", "Mono Mixer Right Playback Switch" connect the  stereo DAC for mono mixing.
* XXX bypass, sidetone, voice
