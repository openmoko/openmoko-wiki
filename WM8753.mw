'''WM8753''' (also the '''Wolfson Codec''') is the "sound card" chip in the [[Neo1973 audio subsystem]]. 

It's connected to the [[S3C2410]] IIS interface for PCM data and the S3C2410 [[I2C]] interface for control. The stereo output (LOUT1 and ROUT1) is connected to [[LM4857]] stereo input (LIN and RIN) for amplification.
