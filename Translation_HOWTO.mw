== Finding what to translate ==
First of all package creator/maintainer have to create *.pot file with all messages included.
Search for this files in source tree and you can edit them.

== Translating ==
Rule of thumb: It's better to have some translation than nothing, so feel free to translate.

== Software ==
There are specialised tools for *.pot (*.po) files edition gtranslator, po4a, poedit, pootle, potool ...
Most of text editors wiil fit also: vim, emax, ed ...
== Updating source tree ==
{{todo|descript SVN update after editing}}
== Notes ==
* Encoding for *.po is UTF-8
* Most of packages in Openembedded tree allready iternationalised, its worth to review them
== Common space for localisation effort ==
