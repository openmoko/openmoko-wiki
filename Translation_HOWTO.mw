== Translating ==
Rule of thumb: It's better to have some translation than nothing, so feel free to translate.

== Software ==
There are specialised tools for *.pot (*.po) files edition gtranslator, po4a, poedit, pootle, potool ...

Most of text editors will fit also: vim, emacs, ed ...

== Updating source tree ==
{{todo|descript SVN update after editing}}
== Notes ==
* Encoding for *.po is UTF-8
* Most of packages in Openembedded tree allready iternationalised, its worth to review them
== Common space for localisation effort ==
