== Overview ==
OMView is a simple image viewer for the openmoko platform. It supports touchscreen gestures, thumbnail view and raw files. It is intended to be lightweight, fast and easy to use. It depends on the [http://www.enlightenment.org/ EFL].

== Download and installation ==
The Viewer is now available in the [CommunityRepository Community Repository] which means you can use the graphical installer on [Om2008.8] and you don't need to update it by hand.
Or Download it from the [http://projects.openmoko.org/frs/?group_id=182project page] and install with opkg:
<pre>
opkg install http://projects.openmoko.org/frs/download.php/373/omview_r15_armv4t.ipk
</pre>

This will install the theme you see on the screenshots:
<pre>
cp /usr/share/ewl/themes/e17.edj /usr/share/ewl/themes/e17.edj.bak
rm /usr/share/ewl/themes/e17.edj
wget -O /usr/share/ewl/themes/e17.edj http://projects.openmoko.org/frs/download.php/372/fireball-ewl-openmoko-r2.edj
</pre>

== Usage ==

[[Image:omview_files.png|thumb]]
* Omview has three modes: directory view, thumbnail view, and fullscreen image view.
* It understands five touchpad gestures: right, up, left, down, click. To use these just move your finger or stylus for at least 50px in one direction.
* In fullscreen view images are automatically scaled and rotated. Not by exif orientation data but only by image dimensions, so that an image takes as much space on the screen while beeing fully visible. This means landscape images are rotated, portait images are left the way they are.

Directory and thumbnail view always show 6 items at the same time with the other items beeing on the previous/next pages. The statusbar on the bottom shows the path and below the subdirectory count/file count/page

== Known Bugs and Limitations==

* thumbnail creation is slower than image viewing and takes much space (~ 100K per image) to free this space just delete .thumbnail folder in the home dir.
