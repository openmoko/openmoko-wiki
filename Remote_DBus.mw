There is a possibility to connect to your Freerunner DBus from remote computer via ssh.
To be able to do so you need to compile and install program called [http://gabriel.sourceforge.net/ Gabriel].
There is a release but svn version is more advanced:
<pre>svn co https://gabriel.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gabriel gabriel</pre>

On Freerunner you need installed [http://www.opkg.org/package_192.html Socat]. It will be then launched by Gabriel via ssh.

Then just run:
<pre>gabriel --host=192.168.0.202 --username=root --password= -d unix:path=/var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket</pre>

You should see something like this:
<pre>gabriel --host=192.168.0.202 --username=root --password= -d unix:path=/var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket

** (gabriel:7437): WARNING **: Public key method didn't work out, trying password method..

Listening to D-Bus clients on: "unix:abstract=/tmp/gabriel"
</pre>

That's it. Now to connect to DBus on Freerunner you have to use something like this:

<pre>DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS="unix:abstract=/tmp/gabriel" qdbusviewer</pre>
Remember to run this last command as '''root''' as DBus allows the access only for the same user.

Happy hacking!
