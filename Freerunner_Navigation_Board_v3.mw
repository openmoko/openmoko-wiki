The third version of the Freerunner Navigation Board was necessary because the compass chip used on the [[Freerunner Navigation Board]] and the [[Freerunner Navigation Board v2]] has been discontinued.

=Features=

Due to the new, smaller compass chip, the FRNBv3 offers a complete 10-DoF navigation solution. In addition to the 3D-Gyroscope, 3D-Kompass and the barometer which are already known from the FRNBv2, the v3 adds an high resolution accelerometer. It should be more accurate for navigation purposes than the integrated LIS302 accelerometers.

===Top Side===
* 3D Gyroscope ITG-3200
* 3D Magnetometer HMC5883L
* Air pressure/temperature sensor BMP085
* Accelerometer BMA180

==Bottom side==
The Bottom side of the PCB contains optional chips which might be used for different purposes. The FRNBv3 includes:
* TCA6705 7 channel LED controller
* MPR121 touch sensor controller
* M26LR64 I²C EEPROM accessible through RFID (antenna still needed)
* TXS0102 I²C level shifter (to connect additional sensors
* MIC1557 based 38KHz oscillator (for IR-remote control applications)

==Additional features==
The board operates with 3V or 3.3V which is needed for the sensors to work correctly. To be able to connect the board to other devices (for example GTA04, OpenPandora, Always Innovating devices), the I/O voltage can be anything between 1.8V and VCC.
To use the board with the Freerunner, just short the VCC and VCCIO solder.

All sensors feature a "conversion complete" output which can trigger an interrupt. These signals are now available at small solder points.


=Documentation=
Schematic and board layout files are available from https://gitorious.org/frnbv3/frnbv3-hardware (CadSoft EAGLE 5.x format)


==Pinout==
Will be added soon.

==Installation==
See [[Freerunner Navigation Board v2]]


==Issues==
'''Known HW or SW Issues'''
Nothing known yet.

==Software==

=Availability=
The [http://handheld-linux.com handheld-linux.com] team already takes preorders. You can find it [http://www.handheld-linux.com/wiki.php?page=Navigation%20Board here].

Two assembly options are available:
* Complete: Contains all chips as described above.
* Standard: Top-Side only, contains all sensors relevant for navigation purposes. The compass chip should be a little bit more accurate since a few capacitors on the bottom side are missing. They could distord the magnetic field.
