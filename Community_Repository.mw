= Add Repository on Neo = 
== Add repositories by installing repository packages ==
* The community-repository is installed by default in [[ASU | OM2008.8]].

== Add repository manually ==
* Create a file, here we call it community-repos.conf
 > echo "arch community-repos 50" > community-repos.conf
 > echo "src community-repos http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/Multiverse/" >> community-repos.conf
* Connect to your Neo with USB
 > sudo ifconfig usb0 192.168.0.200
 > scp community-repos.conf root@192.168.0.202:/etc/opkg/
* Let your Neo connect to the Internet
** For USB users:
 > ssh root@192.168.0.202
 > echo 1 | sudo tee  /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
 > sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.0.0/24 -j MASQUERADE
 > scp /etc/resolv.conf root@192.168.0.202:/etc/
** For geek users:
 > ssh root@192.168.0.202
 > iwlist eth0 scan
 Find a usable AP lets say OpenMind (Support it's an open AP)
 > iwconfig eth0 essid OpenMind
 > udhcpc eth0
 Then pray, if successfull, remove default gw *twice*.
 > route -n  # to see your gateway of eth0 say 192.168.1.1
 > route del default
 > route del default
 > route add default gw 192.168.1.1 eth0
 Then you can ping wiki.openmoko.org for testing :)
** For GUI user:
 Click Setting
 Click WiFi
 Find an AP
 Click that AP
 Input password if needed
 pray
