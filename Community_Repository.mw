There are many [[Users Repositories]] where people can feed software for their Neo smartphones. This diversity makes it sometimes difficult to find the right package for the right distribution. Openmoko Inc. hosts a Community Repository as a central service where independent Neo application developers can release projects, so that installing a new application `just works out of the box'. It is a similar concept to the [http://www.ubuntu.com/community/ubuntustory/components Universe repository in Ubuntu]. The Repository is at:

 http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/Multiverse


== How to use the repository ? ==

This feed is already installed by default in [[Om2008.8 | Om 2008.8]].

Otherwise, see instructions on the [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Om_2008.8_Installer installer page]. They involve creating a one line file in the /etc/opkg directory.

== How to release packages ? ==

Please use the mailing list: http://lists.openmoko.org/mailman/listinfo/community-repository .
The package manager derives from [[opkg]], so applications should be released as .ipk files.

* [[Create package on projects.openmoko.org and upload]]
* Here are [http://handhelds.org/moin/moin.cgi/BuildingIpkgs| instructions to build ipkgs].
** Using OE
** [[Toolchain|Meta-toolchain]]

Packages in '''Installer''' are displayed according to '''Package Tags'''.
To display a package through [[Om2008.8_Installer |Installer]], add the appropriate tag message. 
{| class="wikitable" border:1px ;
! Category !! Tag 
|- 
| Communication || group::communication 
|-
| Development   || group::programming
|-
| Games         || group::games
|-
| Maps          || group::maps
|-
| Miscellaneous || group::unknown
|-
| Network       || group::network
|-
|Repos          || group::repos
|}

* For OpenEmbedded users, add a Tag by adding one line in your bb file
:For [http://code.google.com/p/comic-reader/source/browse/trunk/data/comic-reader_svn.bb example]:
 PKG_TAGS_${PN} = "group::games"


== Packages quality control ==

The reviewer will check if there have new packages on the mailing list. If you are reviewer and want to review that package
* reply that mail, and say you want to review that
* check if the package follows the policy 
* download the package on projects.openmoko.org
* install that package to see if 
** installable?
** executable able?
** functions the claimed works actually works?
** does it do something bad?
** uninstall it and see if everything still ok?
* if the package is okay, put the package in this [https://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/feeds/community-repository/file-index.txt file] and the package will shown next day. 

Good packages should conform to these quality guidelines:

* Packages in this repository shall not be in OM Official repositories
* Program shall not collect user information and send to others unless it has very clear notification
* Program shall not destroy the system
* All packages shall be run-able on Neo
* The package file name should refer which version of the project is compiled.

== How to contribute ? ==

We need reviewers who can review new packages. This is currently a low workload. If you want to help, please send e-mail to the mailing list The mailing list: [http://lists.openmoko.org/mailman/listinfo/community-repository community-repository@lists.openmoko.org].

Reviewers must have the following:
* an account on projects.openmoko.org
* ssh public key on projects.openmoko.org
* basic svn skills
* basic opkg skills

Openmoko really appreciates your help!
