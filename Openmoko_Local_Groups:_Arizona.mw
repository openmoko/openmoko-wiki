| Very interested in getting the UI right, also some domain-specific PIM apps and Mac OS X syncing/general interoperability.   And of course I plan to do all my coding on the machine in a LISP/Scheme variant lately called Otter, but we'll see how that goes...

| Working on a Scheme-based distributed "meta" UI system (think NeWS but more abstractly specified, and implemented with Chicken Scheme).  Currently I work on this on a Zaurus SL6000; will try to make it portable to several platforms, with this phone being a high-importance one.  Implementation is still in very early stages though.
