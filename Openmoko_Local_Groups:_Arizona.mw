| [[User:JeffAndros|Jeff Andros]]
| C, Java, Perl, Bash, some others (I'm not willing to own up to PHP)
| Order #1822
| East Mesa
| interested in low level development, Bike/Training applications, predictive answering(not having to remember to turn on/off silent) (keep me away from UI design: I could be the character model for dilbert's "interface poisoning" series)
|-
| [[User:Mellon|Ted Lemon]]
| C, LISP, Python, etc.
| GTA01 with Debug board (let me know if you need help unbricking your GTA01)
| Tucson
| Very interested in getting the UI right, also some domain-specific PIM apps and Mac OS X syncing/general interoperability.   And of course I plan to do all my coding on the machine in a LISP/Scheme variant lately called Otter, but we'll see how that goes...
|-
| [[User:ecloud|Shawn Rutledge]]
| Scheme, C, C++, QT, low-level graphics stuff, Bluetooth, etc.
| Got my GTA01 and debug board
| Phoenix
| Working on a Scheme-based distributed "meta" UI system (think NeWS but more abstractly specified, and implemented with Chicken Scheme).  Currently I work on this on a Zaurus SL6000; will try to make it portable to several platforms, with this phone being a high-importance one.  Implementation is still in very early stages though.

| [[User:wesshull|Wes Shull]]
| Python, Qt, trying (J)Ocaml, C when it can't be avoided, Tcl, Perl, assembly, and lots of other stuff once upon a time but not lately
| planning on getting a GTA02, willing to front a group buy
| Tucson
| Despite embedded background, more interested in a working open platform that I can unify geodatabase/GSM/VoIP/messaging on (replacing separate PDA/phone/GPS and possibly walkie-talkie) with a *sane* programming environment (yay PyQt!)
