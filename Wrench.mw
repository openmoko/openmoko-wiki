= Steps and Tips about Wrench tool in ASU theme =

== enlightenment_remote ==
Wrench probably uses utility '''enlightenment_remote'''

This tool is able to 
 <ul>
 <li>Load, Unload and List modules &nbsp; &nbsp; ( ENABLED = AUTOSTART, module must be LOADed before doing this )</li>
 <li>Restart enlightenment, reboot OM, logout from session</li>
 <li>Manage fonts, virtual desktops, winlist and process freeze detection&killing</li>
 <li>And a lot of less important (some not available on FR) functions</li>
 </ul>

To use it from SSH you need to setup environment variable E_IPC_SOCKET. Because it points to a file, it isn't hard to locate it. Just do this:

 ls /tmp/enlightenment-root

'''For reply "disp-:0.0-2166|0"''' do

{{note| Don't forget to escape colon (":") and remove anything after pipe ("|") symbol}}

 export E_IPC_SOCKET=/tmp/enlightenment-root/disp-\:0.0-2166

Now you should be able to use this tool from SSH connection
