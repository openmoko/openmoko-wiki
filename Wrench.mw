To use it you need to setup environment variable E_IPC_SOCKET. Because it's a file, it isn't hard to locate it. Just do this:

 ls /tmp/enlightenment-root

'''For reply "disp-:0.0-2166|0"''' do

 export E_IPC_SOCKET=/tmp/enlightenment-root/disp-\:0.0-2166

{{note| Don't forget to escape colon (":") and remove anything after pipe ("|") symbol}}
