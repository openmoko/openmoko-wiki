1.  there are deformities in the internal GPS connector 

use tweezers to pinch the antenna back to original form.  

Now try re-connecting the antenna.  The antenna should ‘snap’ into place of the connector locking itself firmly.  If it is loose and does not snap, it is possible there will be quality issues.
