=Introduction=
It's not easy to use WiFi with the freerunner:
* 2.6.29 kernels has major issues on ifconfig up/down
* 2.6.28 kernels has random issues on fake wow events
* 2.6.24 kernels has rare random issues
* on OE based distro the wpa-roaming support is broken, the wpa-conf approach is working fine but it does not renew dhcp ip address when the freerunner changes AP
* using udev to trigger interface configuration does not spawn dhcp, the problem is that the kernels brings the interface up, so networks scripts ignore it
* some AP refuses the power management mode of the atheros 6000, so you have to launch some script to setup it when the interface comes up
* connman seems to not support WPA/WPA2 enterprise mode (please confirm)
* other wifi implementation, that in a rude way scan the networks and generate a wpa_supplicant.conf file, does not support WPA/WPA2 enterprise mode
* connman api changed so Illume wifi gadget does not work anymore (please confirm)

=Proposal=
* patch the damned kernel :)
* bore Illume authors to patch wifi gadget with the new connman api
* bore connman authors to support WPA/WPA2
* write a WM indipendent connman applet
* test other NetworksManager to see if they may run fine on the freerunner
* write a simple WiFi manager interacting with wpa_supplicant by dbus.
