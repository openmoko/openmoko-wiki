==Presentation==
ssh-agent permit SSH passwordless login, and works by caching the key(that is encrypted on the filesystem)...so it's more secure than passwordless ssh key files.
Keychain permit us to use ssh-agent easily...and permit us to access the ssh-agent deamon from any terminal...

you can find documetation on the usage of keychain [http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/articles/openssh-key-management-p2.xml here]

==Installation==
All the commands has to be typed on the openmoko(you can also use ssh)
we will download keychain:
 wget http://agriffis.n01se.net/keychain/keychain-2.6.8.tar.bz2
 cd keychain-2.6.8
as install -m0755 keychain /usr/bin/keychain doesn't work because we don't have the install command we will type:
 cp keychain /usr/bin/
 chmod 0775 /usr/bin/keychain
Then we will need to activate it:
 cd /etc/skel
 cp * /home/root/
edit the /home/root/.bashrc file:
 opkg update
 opkg install nano
 nano /home/root/.bashrc
navigate inside the file with the arrows and add this to the end:
 eval `/usr/bin/keychain --ignore-missing --eval  ~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/.ssh/id_dsa`
then quit with ctrl+x,press y to save change,and press enter
Then we will need vte:
 opkg update
 opkg install vte
if keychain doesn't work edit /etc/passwd and change the terminal of the root entry to /bin/bash

==Usage==
start vte and keychain will appear.
It doesn't work with openmoko-terminal2
