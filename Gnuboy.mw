==What works==
When removing the illume keyboard and installing the matchbox-keyboard (See also: [[Switching_Keyboards]]) it's possible to use the matchbox keyboard as input method (tested only on 2007.2, please verify).
You need to create a ~/.matchbox/keyboard.xml file:

 mkdir /home/root/.matchbox
 cp /usr/share/matchbox-keyboard/keyboard.xml ~/.matchbox/

PieterC created a profile to this file to change the layout to a game-boy lay-out (browsing the layouts can easily be done by pushing the > butten in the left bottom corner): add this to ~/.matchbox/keyboard.xml:

 <layout id="GameBoy">
 <row> 
 <space width="500"/>
 <key>  <default display="b" action="s"/> </key> 
 <key> <default display="a" action="d" /> </key> 
 <space width="300"/>
 <key> <default display="↑" action="up" /> </key>
 <space width="4000" extended="true" />
 </row>
 <row>
 <key> <default display=">" action="modifier:layout"/> </key>
 <key fill="true"><default display="start" action="return"/> </key>
 <key> <default display="slt" action="space" /> </key> 
 <space width="500" extended="true"/> 
 <key> <default display="←" action="left" />  </key>
 <key> <default display="↓" action="down" /> </key>
 <key> <default display="→" action="right" /> </key>
 </row>
 </layout>

After untarring gnuboy to the openmoko, you can launch your favorite rom-file by running 

 ./sdlgnuboy --fullscreen=0 --scale=2 pg.gbc

==Some work has to be done...==
Using the matchbox keyboard is clearly only a temporary solution: we need an input method that works out of the box. Since it uses sdl, we can check out the code of duke3d and simply port it into the put_events() function in the main.c. Some of us tried yet to implement this but no one succeeded to implement it, due to this[http://lists.openmoko.org/nabble.html#nabble-td1304780|a1304780] issue.

When trying to implement the touchscreen as an input device for gnuboy, we won't be able to do multi touching (strike 2 buttons at a time). Since this is mandatory to some games (mostly fighting games) on the gameboy (color), we micht not use the touchscreen for all events. I propose to use the accelerometers as up down left & right, and use the touchscreen as A, B, start & select.
