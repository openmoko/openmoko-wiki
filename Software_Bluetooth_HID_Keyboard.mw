"xkbd-bthid is a Bluetooth HID Keyboard in software, meaning this is an application which emulates a Bluetooth Keyboard. I call it soft-HID.

What could you use it for? You can turn any Linux box, PDA or tablet into Bluetooth keyboard and control your DVR, MP3 player or what ever with it."

xkbd-bthid can be adapted for Neo1973.
