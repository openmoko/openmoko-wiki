Currently we are working towards the phase 2 release of the [[Neo1973 Hardware | Neo1973]]. We need freely distributable/licensed ringtones to ship as default ringtones
with the phone.  

Ringtones should be in OGG/Vorbis format (or converted to it), and licensed in a
way that allows free redistribution, such as creative commons by, by-nd, by-sa,
gpl, public domain, etc (more information Bugzilla #199).

== Monophonic ==
The GTA02 release of the [[Neo1973 Hardware | Neo1973]] will only have ONE speaker, making it mono. This might be worthwhile to remember when creating the ringtones.

== Themes ==
The default ringtones need to be part of a theme. The different tones for calls/messages should have a unified feel to it.
