The Neo Freerunner inherited the audio subsystem from its older brother the Neo 1973. However, there are a few small differences. 
This page tries to show and explain the differences and points you to the [[Neo_1973_audio_subsystem | Neo 1973]] page whenever it touches the common points (but there may be overlaps for the sake of usability). It is maintained by the Community and therefore it may contain errors and omissions.
