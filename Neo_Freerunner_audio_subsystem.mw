The Neo Freerunner (GTA02) inherited the audio subsystem from its older brother the Neo 1973 (GTA01). However, there are a few small differences. 
This page tries to show and explain the differences and points you to the [[Neo_1973_audio_subsystem | Neo 1973]] page whenever it touches the common points (but there may be overlaps for the sake of usability). As wiki pages are, errors and omissions are likely, and your help is welcomed.

'''Differences from Neo 1973'''
* There is only 1 (mono) built-in loud speaker instead of 2 (stereo).
* The Wolfson Codec driver presents 94 separate controls {switches, multiplexers, and volumes} to the alsa system (in both Neos). Unfortunately they are not mapped exactly the same for the GTA01 as for the GTA02.

'''Possible sound connections through the Wolfson Codec'''

* "Yes" = Confirmed, alsa state file exists.
* "No" = Not possible / not desirable.
* "Should" = Should be possible, not confirmed yet.
* "?" = Have no idea.

'''Alsamixer channel controls'''

The ALSA state files are installed by default, and belong to package ''"openmoko-alsa-scenarios"''.
To see where the files reside, do ''"opkg files openmoko-alsa-scenarios"''.
Currently they are in ''"/usr/share/openmoko/scenarios/"''.

* These files I still don't know what they are for:

'''Specific Software'''

Angus Ainslie has written a simple [http://n2.nabble.com/Sound-quality-in-calls.-tp1087522p1096155.html python volume control] (which is getting more and more sophisticated) using some of these settings.

Installing the GUI mixer
