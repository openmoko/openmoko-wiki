'''neod''' is a process in the X session taking care of various device functions which fall outside the scope of [[gsmd]] such as the buttons and power management. It is considered a temporary, throw-away solution [http://svnweb.openmoko.org/trunk/src/target/OM-2007.2/daemons/neod/README?view=auto]
. As of writing, neod has the features as follows.

== Functionality in documentation ==

* [[Getting Started with your Neo1973#Buttons]]
* [[Power management menu]]
* [[Functions menu]]

== Inputs ==

* /dev/input/event%d: Hardware buttons and headphone jack, touchscreen as a button
* Internal timers for buttons and powersave modes
* GConf for power management state
* X window properties to detect the [[Today]] window
* GTK menus

== Outputs ==

* /sys/class/backlight/gta01-bl/brightness for screen brightness
* /sys/power/state for lock suspend
* 'apm' for powersave suspend (difference to previous?)
* 'reboot' and 'poweroff'
* 'amixer' for headphone mixer setting
* 'xrandr' for screen orientation
* 'gpe-scap' for screenshots
* [[PulseAudio]] for samples "startup" and "touchscreen"
