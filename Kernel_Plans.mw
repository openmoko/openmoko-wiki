This document explains the current kernel plan for the GTA01/GTA02 kernel. The idea is to share
the motivations behind the actual decisions. This is a draft, and the relevant suggestions will be incorporated into it.

We would like to try this model for one or two months and if we find we are doing something wrong we will update the plans.

== Path review process ==

Allow 2 days before applying non-trivial patches to allow for community feedback and for feedback from subsystem maintainers. If the patch has not issues that we can tell and it is relevant it will be applied.

== Use tags and not forks for stable kernels ==

We hope that developers actually care about the development branch. If they care, they will helps us reject patches that will likely cause trouble. We will also get more testing.

We will tag stable kernels in the repository.

We know that people like forks and code that does not change often, but the linear model is working with upstream kernel (with a lot more people involved of course).

== Upstream Linux kernel ==

We should have very basic GTA02 support upstream soon. Once we get to reach this milestone we will check what drivers can be included.
