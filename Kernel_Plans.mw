This document explains the current kernel plan for the GTA01/GTA02 kernel. The idea is to share the motivations behind the actual decisions. This is a draft, and the relevant suggestions will be incorporated into it.

We would like to try this model for one or two months and if we find we are doing something wrong we will update the plans.

== Patch review process ==

If the patch has not issues that we can tell and it is relevant it will be applied. If we can tell it is a good patch right away or a critical fix we will just apply the patch.

Allow two days before applying non-trivial patches to allow for community feedback and for feedback from subsystem maintainers.

=== Patchwork ===

Patchwork is a nice system. http://patchwork.kernel.org It does not replace a mailing list but it helps keep track of pending patches. We should use it.

== Use tags and not forks for stable kernels ==

We hope that developers actually care about the development branch. If they care, they will helps us reject patches that will likely cause trouble. We will also get more testing.

We will tag stable kernels in the repository.

We know that people like forks and code that does not change often, but the linear model is working with upstream kernel (with a lot more people involved of course).

Of course if you want to create a stable tree you do not need us. You can fork and cherry-pick changes. That's why the current Linux model works.

== Upstream Linux kernel ==

We should have very basic GTA02 support upstream soon. Once we get to reach this milestone we will check what drivers can be included.
