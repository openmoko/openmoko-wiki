== Vibrator ==

This is in reference to the vibrator in the Neo Freerunner, however it is likely identical to the Neo 1973, as best I can tell.

=== Controlling ===
The vibrator is controlled through:
  /sys/class/leds/neo1973\:vibrator/brightness
When off, it will read 0.  Valid ranges appear to be 0-255, with 255 being the fastest.

=== Python Script For Playing Beats ===
Reads beats from a file and plays them on the openmoko vibrator.
 
File format is human readable text, consisting of a simple sequence of integer pairs.  The first number in the pair representing the intensity of the vibration from 0 to 255.  The second number represents the duration in milliseconds to hold that intensity.  Any non digit characters in the file count as a separators between numbers, but are otherwise ignored.

The following is an example "song" file that can be used to test the beat player.
