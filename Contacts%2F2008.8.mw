== Searching ==

The contacts app does have search functionality, albeit rudimentary.  If you enter a letter, the list will fast-forward to the first entry that begins with that letter.  No further search funcationality appears to be available.

2008.09 has a better search, but it doesn't seem to be enabled by default in either 2008.08 (updated to 2008.09) or directly-installed 2008.09.  To enable it, edit the file <tt>/home/root/.config/Trolltech</tt>, in the section <tt>[default]</tt>, put the line
<tt>EnableFindBar=1</tt> .  If the file doesn't exist, create it with only those two lines in.
