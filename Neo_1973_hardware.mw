=== GSM/GPRS ===

The GSM/GPRS modem is Texas Instruments Calypso based

=== AGPS ===
Hammerhead AGPS from Global Locate

=== SD-Card ===

microSD aka Transflash

=== Bluetooth ===

=== Audio ===

==== Wolfson Codec ====

==== Analog wired Headset ====

There's a four-ring 2.5mm stereo jack which provides connectivity to old-fashined wired headsets.

The headsets used by Motorola smartphones (A780,A1200, ...) have a compatible configuration

==== Bluetooth Headset ====

This one is wired via PCM bus from the CSR Bluetooth chip to the Wolfson codec.

== History ==

=== GTA01 ===

This is the most simple, non-bluetooth version of the prototype.

==== GTA01v3 ====

First generation of prototypes that was given to internal OpenMoko software developers.

Unfortunately not useful at all due to non-working touchscreen.

* ATAG_REVISION: 0x0000130

==== GTA01v4 ====

Second generation of prototypes that was given to Harald + Mickey.

Unfortunately still not useful due to half-working touchscreen.

* ATAG_REVISION: 0x00000140

=== GTA01B ===

This is the bluetooth-enabled fork of GTA01

==== GTA01Bv2 ====

This is the first produced version of the bluetooth-enabled version.

* ATAG_REVISION: 0x00000220

==== GTA01Bv3 ====

This is the second produced version of the bluetooth-enabled version. It contains mainly GPS-related fixes.

* ATAG_REVISION: 0x00000230

This is the version that is shipped in Phase 0

==== GTA01Bv4 ====

This is the version that is shipped in Phase 1

== Distinguishing hardware revisions ==

=== Inside the [[Bootloader]] ===

Every hardware revision has its own u-boot image type.  Thus, the bootloader has the revision hard-coded.
The hardware revision is passed on to the kernel via the ATAG mechanism (ATAG_REVISION)

=== Inside the [[Kernel]] ===

The kernel receives the ATAG_REVISION during bootup, and saves its contents in the "system_rev" global variable.

=== From Userspace ===

The kernel exports the system_rev variable in /proc/cpuinfo as "Revision :" line.
