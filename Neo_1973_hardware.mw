{{Neo1973}}

Openmoko is a software distribution stack that sits on top of a [[hardware]] platform.  The [[Neo1973]] phone is the first hardware platform to take advantage of Openmoko.  You can find specifics of the [[:Category:Neo1973 Hardware | Neo1973 Hardware]] by reviewing this introduction page and the pages in the category as shown at the bottom of this page.

'''Note that this page is about the first Openmoko phone which is now discontinued. See details on the second Openmoko phone at this page - [[Neo FreeRunner GTA02 Hardware]].'''

== Physical Dimensions ==
* 120.7 x 62 x 18.5 mm (4.75 x 2.44 x 0.728 inch)
* 184 +/- 5 g (6.5 ounces)
* For the purposes of acquiring/cutting a properly sized screen protector, the display hole of the case is about 45 x 59 mm, while the top cover internal frame can house up to a 53 x 74 mm protector; sizes much larger than the display hole would obviously necessitate removing the front cover for installation.
* A Useful size comparison between the Neo1973, iPhone, Motorola A1200 and the SEM600i can be seen at [http://www.sizeasy.com/page/size_comparison/5512-Neo1973-vs-Apple-iPhone-vs-M600i-2-vs-A-1200 sizeasy]

== Alternate cases ==
A number of alternate case designs have been suggested and requested.
[[Alternate Neo1973 case designs]]

== Hardware revisions==
{{Main|GTA01 revisions}}

===Debug Connector===
{{Main|Debug Board v2}}

===Test points===

* GSM RTS - H-TP1531
* GSM CTS - H-TP1530
* GSM Modem on - R10818 - ungrounded end
* GSM_EN - R1501 (not present) - ungrounded end

== Distinguishing hardware revisions ==
=== Inside the [[Bootloader]] ===
Every hardware revision has its own u-boot image type.  Thus, the bootloader has the revision hard-coded.
The hardware revision is passed on to the kernel via the ATAG mechanism (ATAG_REVISION)

=== Inside the [[Kernel]] ===
The kernel receives the ATAG_REVISION during bootup, and saves its contents in the "system_rev" global variable.

=== From Userspace ===
The kernel exports the system_rev variable in /proc/cpuinfo as "Revision :" line.

??? So does GTA01Bv4 equal the cat /proc/cpuinfo output of
 Hardware        : GTA01
 Revision        : 0240

== Approval ==
*CE compliance is needed before a product can be sold in the EU. The CE mark indicates that a product complies to the relevant legislation, defined in the  [http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newapproach/standardization/harmstds/reflist.html harmonised standards]. This refers also to the most relevant, for the Neo1973,  [http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newapproach/standardization/harmstds/reflist/emc.html Directive 89/336/EEC on electromagnetic compatibility] (EMC is the art of assuring [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_compatibility electromagnetic compatibility] between products). The standards are defined by [http://www.cenelec.org CENELEC] (European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization), but not verified by any authority. It is the responsibilty of the manufacturer to convince himself that a product is in compliance, and is obligated to be able to prove this (with relevant technical documentation) for a specific product to the authorities on request. Whether the current Phase 1 devices are actually tested against the directives are unknown, no documentation has been disclosed, other than the fact that the devices bear the CE mark.
