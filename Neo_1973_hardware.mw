[[Openmoko]] is a software distribution stack that sits on top of a [[hardware]] platform.  The [[Neo1973]] phone is the first hardware platform to take advantage of Openmoko.  You can find specifics of the [[:Category:Neo1973 Hardware | Neo1973 Hardware]] by reviewing this introduction page and the pages in the category as shown at the bottom of this page.

'''Note that this page is about the first Openmoko phone which is now discontinued. See details on the second Openmoko phone at this page - [[Neo FreeRunner GTA02 Hardware]].'''

==User experiences of Phase 0 hardware==

==User reports of robustness==
User experiences - drops onto concrete - ... [[Neo1973 Robustness]]

== Physical Dimensions ==
* 120.7 x 62 x 18.5 mm (4.75 x 2.44 x 0.728 inch)
* 184 +/- 5 g (6.5 ounces)
* For the purposes of acquiring/cutting a properly sized screen protector, the display hole of the case is about 45 x 59 mm, while the top cover internal frame can house up to a 53 x 74 mm protector; sizes much larger than the display hole would obviously necessitate removing the front cover for installation.
* A Useful size comparison between the Neo1973, iPhone, Motorola A1200 and the SEM600i can be seen at [http://www.sizeasy.com/page/size_comparison/5512-Neo1973-vs-Apple-iPhone-vs-M600i-2-vs-A-1200 sizeasy]

== Main components ==
=== Processor ===
The main Processor (CPU) of the Neo1973 is a Samsung S3C2410AL-26 (Capable of running up to 266 MHz)

==== CALYPSO digital baseband ====
Unfortunately we cannot provide many details on the GSM chipset due to very tight NDAs.  However, this is not neccessarily required, since it interfaces using a standard UART serial line with the S3C2410.  On that interface, [http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/07_series/07.05/ GSM 07.05], [http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/07_series/07.10/ GSM 07.10] and other standardized protocols are used.

== History ==
=== GTA01 ===
This is the most simple, non-bluetooth version of the prototype.

==== GTA01v3 ====
First generation of prototypes that was given to internal OpenMoko software developers.

Unfortunately not useful at all due to non-working touchscreen.

* ATAG_REVISION: 0x0000130

==== GTA01v4 ====
Second generation of prototypes that was given to [[User:HaraldWelte|Harald]] +[[User:Mickey|Mickey]].

Unfortunately still not useful due to half-working touchscreen.

* ATAG_REVISION: 0x00000140

=== GTA01B ===
This is the bluetooth-enabled fork of GTA01

==== GTA01Bv2 ====
This is the first produced version of the bluetooth-enabled version.

* ATAG_REVISION: 0x00000220

==== GTA01Bv3 ====
This is the second produced version of the bluetooth-enabled version. It contains mainly GPS-related fixes.

* ATAG_REVISION: 0x00000230

This is the version that is shipped in [[Neo1973#Phase_0_.28GTA01Bv3.29|Phase 0]].

===== GTA01Bv3 Errata =====
====== PMU unable to resume from suspend ======
Due to use of wrong GPIO/EINT pin, the PMU cannot wake-up the phone after suspend.  This means, specifically, '''the following events can not bring the phone back from suspend-to-ram''':
* PMU RTC Alarm
* Power button press
* Charger events (charger insertion/removal/error)
* Low battery

====== Stand-by time extremely low ======
This is due to a design bug resulting in at least 30mA additional standby current, since we cannot properly switch off the power supply to the S3C2410 PLL's.  There is nothing we can do to change this with post-production fixes.  GTA01Bv4 will address this issue.

====== GSM doesn't resume phone from suspend ======
The GSM modem currently doesn't signalize a wakeup interrupt to the S3C2410 in case there's some noteworthy event, such as incoming call, loss of network, incoming SMS or the like.

This is a serious issue, but can be fixed with a GSM Modem Firmware update.

====== GSM Sidetone too loud ======
The local feedback sidetone (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidetone]) is too loud.  This will be addressed in a GSM firmware update

====== Bad block ======
Due to an error in the production process, the factory-programmed NAND bad block information has been lost.  This means that some blocks in the flash will wear out rapidly, which might become as bad as rendering the device unusable.

==== GTA01Bv4 ====
This is the version that is being shipped in [[Neo1973#Phase_1_.28GTA01Bv4.29|Phase 1]]

===== Looks =====
This is what the GTA01Bv4 PCB looks like without the shielding cans, which will be fitted later.
[[Image:Gta01b_v4_front.jpg|thumb|400px|Component side]]
[[Image:Gta01b_v4_back.jpg|thumb|400px|Display side]]

===== Errata =====

There were two versions of GTA01Bv4: some were given away (red mainboard), and some were sold (green mainboard). The given-away have [[one transistor too many]].

===== Changes from GTA01Bv3 =====
# Fix all Errata items from GTA01Bv3
# Add I2C, SPI and one irq and wakeup capable GPIO pin to debug port plus have test pads for all these signals (for soldering wires directly on the pcb)
# Fix a number of production related details and minor hardware details that are not user-visible

===GTA02===
The [[GTA02#.22Phase_2.22_.28GTA02.2C_.22Mass_Market.22.29|GTA02]] is now called the Neo FreeRunner and shipped within the "Mass Market launch" (see [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Neo1973#.22Phase_2.22_.28GTA02.2C_.22Mass_Market.22.29|timeline]).
It is a new main release with [[Neo1973:_GTA01Bv4_versus_GTA02_comparison|features added]]

===Debug Connector===
This is the connector used to connect the [[Debug Board]] and possibly other hardware.

Connections are:
* 39 - GND
* 38 - STDI
* 37 - _RESET
* 36 - STMS
* 35 - STCK
* 34 - STDO
* 33 - GSM_EN
* 29 - _STRST
* 19 - X_I2C_SCL (H-TP4703)
* 18 - X_I2C_SDA (H-TP4704)
* 17 - SPI_CLK0
* 16 - SPI_MOSI0
* 15 - SPI-MISO0 
* 14 - SS0
* 13 - EINT3 (H-TP4705)
* 3 - MODEM_TXD (H-TP4701)
* 2 - MODEM_RXD (H-TP4702)

Information from [http://people.openmoko.org/roh/Debugport_GTA01bv4.png].

===Test points===

* GSM RTS - H-TP1531
* GSM CTS - H-TP1530
* GSM Modem on - R10818 - ungrounded end
* GSM_EN - R1501 (not present) - ungrounded end

== Distinguishing hardware revisions ==
=== Inside the [[Bootloader]] ===
Every hardware revision has its own u-boot image type.  Thus, the bootloader has the revision hard-coded.
The hardware revision is passed on to the kernel via the ATAG mechanism (ATAG_REVISION)

=== Inside the [[Kernel]] ===
The kernel receives the ATAG_REVISION during bootup, and saves its contents in the "system_rev" global variable.

=== From Userspace ===
The kernel exports the system_rev variable in /proc/cpuinfo as "Revision :" line.

??? So does GTA01Bv4 equal the cat /proc/cpuinfo output of
 Hardware        : GTA01
 Revision        : 0240

== Approval ==
*CE compliance is needed before a product can be sold in the EU. The CE mark indicates that a product complies to the relevant legislation, defined in the  [http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newapproach/standardization/harmstds/reflist.html harmonised standards]. This refers also to the most relevant, for the Neo1973,  [http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newapproach/standardization/harmstds/reflist/emc.html Directive 89/336/EEC on electromagnetic compatibility] (EMC is the art of assuring [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_compatibility electromagnetic compatibility] between products). The standards are defined by [http://www.cenelec.org CENELEC] (European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization), but not verified by any authority. It is the responsibilty of the manufacturer to convince himself that a product is in compliance, and is obligated to be able to prove this (with relevant technical documentation) for a specific product to the authorities on request. Whether the current Phase 1 devices are actually tested against the directives are unknown, no documentation has been disclosed, other than the fact that the devices bear the CE mark.
