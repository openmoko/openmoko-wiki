== Purpose ==

DFUScript was written to help users who have multiple DFU compatible devices, such as a freerunner and a bluetooth module in a laptop, flash their phones without typing the additional command line options such as the hex key device identifier. This script will use dfu-util to flash the rootfs, kernel or u-boot.

== Source ==

Currently DFUScript is available for download at http://projects.openmoko.org/projects/dfuscript/

== Configuration ==

DFUScript assumes that dfu-util is in /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin, or /bin. If your copy of dfu-util is not in this location just open dfuscript.sh in your favorite text editor and append :/path/to/dfu-util/folder to the end of the PATH variable.

Documentation for dfu-util is available at [[Dfu-util]]. 

== Usage ==

The DFUScript supports the following methods and is used as follows
<pre>
Usage: ./dfuscript.sh deviceType alternativeType fileName

Accepted Devices:
  freerunner or fr - Neo Freerunner
  neo1973 or 1973 - FIC Neo1973

Accepted Alternatives:
  kernel - Usually a file ending in .bin
  rootfs - Usually a file ending in .jffs2
  u-boot - Usually a file ending in .bin
</pre>

== Reference Documentation for FreeRunner ==

{{note|All following instructions assume you already have your freerunner booted in NOR, for more information about getting the freerunner ready to flash see [[Flashing_the_Neo_FreeRunner]]}}
{{warning|DFUScript does NOT check to see if the filenames you pass are valid, please ensure you pass a correct filename to this script or you run the risk of damaging your phone.}}

Flash the kernel

<pre>
./dfuscript.sh fr kernel kernelName.image.bin
</pre>

Flash the rootfs

<pre>
./dfuscript.sh fr rootfs rootfsName.rootfs.jffs2
</pre>

Flash the u-boot
<pre>
./dfuscript.sh fr u-boot version_name_of-u-boot.bin
</pre>

== Reference Documentation for Neo1973 ==

{{note|All following instructions assume you already have your freerunner booted in DFU mode (NAND), for more information about getting the Neo1973 ready to flash see [[Flashing_the_Neo_1973]]}}
{{warning|DFUScript does NOT check to see if the filenames you pass are valid, please ensure you pass a correct filename to this script or you run the risk of damaging your phone.}}

Flash the kernel

<pre>
./dfuscript.sh 1973 kernel kernelName.image.bin
</pre>

Flash the rootfs

<pre>
./dfuscript.sh 1973 rootfs rootfsName.rootfs.jffs2
</pre>

Flash the u-boot
{{warning|Flashing your u-boot can brick your phone, please ensure you are using the correct u-boot image. If your phone is bricked in this process a dboard is the only way to recover! This is not suggested unless you have a dboard!!}}
<pre>
./dfuscript.sh 1973 u-boot version_name_of-u-boot.bin
</pre>
