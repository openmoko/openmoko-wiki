== Why aren't there Web forums? ==

This question did come up regularly [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-June/019256.html (example)] on the community mailing list. Apparently, there are two groups of people: one group does not like Web forums; the other group prefers Web forums. This leads to advocacy for each style of communication without any real conclusion.

The consensus after all these discussions is as follows:

* There is no single system which suits everyone.
* Mailing lists are the traditional approach for many open source projects (and are already in use).
* There is no benefit in convincing anyone to switch, nor is it likely to happen.
* We can provide access to the lists in addition to the traditional interfaces (e-mail, Web archives).
* The users can decide themselves!
