= Why not use Discussion  Forums? =

This question did come up regularily  [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-June/019256.html] on the community discussion mailing list [[http://lists.openmoko.org/mailman/listinfo/]].

Apparently, there are two groups of people. One does not like forums and the other one would see some benefits. Therefore each one tries to convince the other to switch.

My conclusion of all those discussions is:

* we need both in parallel.	
* each system has its benefits and let's decide users themselves.
