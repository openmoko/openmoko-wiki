== Idea ==
Using bluetooth GPS dongle with any device is in fact nothing more than sending clear text (NMEA protocol) over serial port:
 1. BT device (dongle) announces it's serial port (virtual serial port - Bluetooth SPP/SP profile)
 2. BT client connects to the dongle
 3. Dongle opens serial connection and send stream of NMEA data. That's all!

'''So let's see what NEO can do:''' 
* We got device equipped with GPS
* We got very powerful bluez stack and utilities 
* We can get NMEA data
* We can announce Serial (SPP/SP) service using bluetooth
* and finally... we can bind GPS port with BT port and redirect NMEA to any BT client that would like to read it :)

'''Profits:'''
* We can share GPS data with anyone (Phone/Smartphone/PC/Laptop)
* Maybe sending that data to more than one person (I don't know the exact BT capabilities)
* Whenever you want you can use your PocketPC powered with Automapa or TomTom and don't have to buy another GPS device
* many many more :)

I've made few tests on desktop debian and was able to get data with Holux GM-101 Handheld GPS (USB Cable) and Nokia N70 (BT)

 0. Prerequisites: connect GPS unit, setup bluez and remember to pair your devices!

 1. Make BT listener: '''rfcomm listen 0''' (on my system it binds connected device to /dev/rfcomm0)

 2. Announce your SP service: '''sdptool add sp 1'''

 3. Run some GPS aware application on your client device

 4. On successful connection rfcomm will say something like: <br>''Waiting for connection on channel 1 <br>Connection from 00:**:**:**:**:** to /dev/rfcomm0<br>Press CTRL-C for hangup''

 5. '''cat /dev/ttyUSB0 >/dev/rfcomm0 ''' (where /dev/ttyUSB0 is my USB to serial converter connected to GPS)

 6. Should work :D 


If you can connect but there is now data:

 - use "cat /dev/your_gps_device" to see if GPS is sending NMEA data to PC (for examle in holux you have to switch some options in menu)<br>should look something like this:<br>'''<br>PGSA,A,2,19,18,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0*32<br>$GPGSV,3,1,11,03,71,207,23,06,66,169,22,22,64,137,31,19,57,289,32*7F<br>$GPGSV,3,2,11,18,46,065,33,21,21,082,00,16,11,193,00,15,11,025,00*75<br>$GPGSV,3,3,11,08,08,319,00,14,05,142,00,26,05,011,00*44<br>$GPRMC,225506.064,'''

 - check paring 

In a thew weeks time I should get my new Forerunner, so I will try to move this idea to OpenMoko platform.

== Freerunner as GPS bluetooth device==
This is described here: http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/GPS#GTA02
It allows to use the freerunner as ordinary BT GPS reciever. BT aware devices like navigation systems can then use the freeruners GPS signals.
