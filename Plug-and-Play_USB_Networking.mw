= Introduction = 

I provide here an example setup which are more complicated than your setup probably will be.

= Use case= 

I have 1 laptop and 2 freerunners. Whenever I plug my freerunner, I want my laptop recognize 
which freerunner was plugged in and act accordingly. Also automagically set up the networking for me.

= Prerequisites = 

You need a linux/unix computer with working NetworkManager setup.
I have successfully use this method more than a month now, with Ubuntu 9.04 (jaunty), 
I will test it also on Ubuntu 8.10 (intrepid), and report back here.

The NetworkManager on jaunty is:
<pre>
ii  network-manager                            0.7.1~rc4-0ubuntu1 
ii  network-manager-gnome                      0.7.1~rc4.1-0ubuntu1
</pre>

= File/directory structure =

 /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/freerunner_bob   (owner: root, rights: 600)
 /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/freerunner_bobek (owner: root, rights: 600)
 /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/10myiptables           (owner: root, rights: 755)

= File contents = 

/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/freerunner_bob:
<pre>
