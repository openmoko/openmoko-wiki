===Installation===
If you flash the freerunner with a kernel image from QT Moko, then you must install the kernel and the root file system. If you have [[Qi]] installed then you can install the QT Moko on the SD card. This seems to be useful if you want to work with different distribution and you can change the distribution just by changing the Mirco SD card in your freerunner. 

Switch off your freerunner and press AUX and Power-On button at the same time. Your freerunner is showing the following U-Boot Menu:

   *** BOOT MENU (NOR) ***

   Boot
   Boot from Mirco SD (FAT/ext2)
   Set Console to USB
   Set Console to Serial
   Reboot
   Power Off  

The freerunner will stay in this mode for only 30 sec. Within this time you have to start <tt>dfu-util</tt>. Otherwise the freerunner will start to boot the installed operating system.
If you want to flash the kernel image (you will need to be root on you PC) then you have to start the following command in the 30sec your see the BOOT MENU:

    # dfu-util -a kernel -R -D uImage-v5.bin

and finally the root fs with this one:

    # dfu-util -a rootfs -R -D qtmoko-debian-v5.jffs2
