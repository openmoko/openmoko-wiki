* [http://activationrecord.net/radekp/qtmoko/download/qtmoko-debian-v5.jffs2 qtmoko-debian-v5.jffs2] or later versions 
* [http://activationrecord.net/radekp/qtmoko/download/uImage-v5.bin uImage-v5.bin] or later versions 

===Installation===
If you flash the freerunner with a kernel image from QT Moko, then you must install the kernel and the root file system. If you have [[Qi]] installed then you can install the QT Moko on the SD card. This seems to be useful if you want to work with different distribution and you can change the distribution just by changing the Mirco Sd card in your freerunner. 

If you want to flash the kernel image (you will need to be root) with this following command:

    # dfu-util -a kernel -R -D uImage-v5.bin

and finally the root fs with this one:

    # dfu-util -a rootfs -R -D qtmoko-debian-v5.jffs2
