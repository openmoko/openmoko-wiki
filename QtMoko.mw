===Installation===
If you flash the freerunner with a kernel image from Qt Moko, then you must install the kernel and the root file system. If you have [[Qi]] installed then you can install the Qt Moko on the SD card. This seems to be useful if you want to work with different distribution and you can change the distribution just by changing the Mirco SD card in your freerunner. 

Switch off your freerunner and press AUX and Power-On button at the same time. Your freerunner is showing the following U-Boot Menu:

   *** BOOT MENU (NOR) ***

   Boot
   Boot from Mirco SD (FAT/ext2)
   Set Console to USB
   Set Console to Serial
   Reboot
   Power Off  

The freerunner will stay in this mode for only 30 sec. Within this time you have to start <tt>dfu-util</tt>. Otherwise the freerunner will start to boot the installed operating system.
If you want to flash the kernel image (you will need to be root on you PC) then you have to start the following command in the 30sec your see the BOOT MENU:

    # dfu-util -a kernel -R -D uImage-v8.bin

and finally the root fs with this one:

    # dfu-util -a rootfs -R -D qtmoko-debian-v8.jffs2

===First Boot===
After finishing the installation without errors you have to start the freerunner and calibrate the  touch screen. The you see the installed ''Qt Moko'' on your device.

===Login===
If you want to login to your freerunner set up network connection (see [[USB Networking]]) with USB cable and start:
   desktop# ssh -X -l root 192.168.0.202

The root password is empty so set it for security reason especially when you open the ssh-daemon on the WLAN network interface. Define root password as usual on a linux box with
   neo# passwd
If you have established the internet connection via USB cable then update the repository data:
   neo# apt-get update 
If you want to check if the internet connection is available on your freerunner ping the OpenMoko web server with:
   neo# ping 88.198.93.221
   neo# ping wiki.openmoko.org
If the first ping works and the second doesn't then check the DNS server settings (see [[USB Networking]]).


===Setting Time and Date===
Set the time and date on from your linux box with
<pre>
ssh root@openmoko "date -us @`date -u +%s`"
</pre>
If you want to set the time with a NTP Client install the following package, if you have a network connection available (see [[USB Networking]])
<pre>
# apt-get install ntpdate
# ntpdate-debian
</pre>
For further detail see [[Setting Date and Time]].
