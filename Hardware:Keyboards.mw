*Here is a proposal for an integral thumb keyboard. It is based on the concepts proposed in this document [http://www.dynavoxtech.com/files/papers/LeMo00a.pdf "A METHOD FOR OPTIMIZING SINGLE-FINGER KEYBOARDS"]

====Some important notes about this design:====
*Green button on top, left is dial. Red button on top, right is hang up. Could double as enter/escape.
*Blue buttons are shift, symbol, backspace and localization.
*Localization button modifies the basic Latin symbols to produce the variants used in many European (and non European such as Turkish) languages.
*Yellow buttons make the numeric pad.
*Provides a full keyboard, yet the device is significantly smaller than any other comparable.
*The design above uses a 2.6" screen, which is the minimum size for VGA.
*Keys are bigger than, for example, those of a Treo.
*'''Allows for one handed operation'''. Absolutely necessary for a phone.
