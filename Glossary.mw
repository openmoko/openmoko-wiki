==AGPS==
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_GPS Assisted GPS],
generally abbreviated as A-GPS or aGPS,
is a system which can, under certain conditions,
improve the startup performance, or time-to-first-fix (TTFF)
of a GPS satellite-based positioning system.

==BGA==
A
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_grid_array ball grid array (BGA)]
is a type of surface-mount packaging used for integrated circuits.

==BSC==
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_station_subsystem#Base_station_controller Base Station Controller]
- This is a part of the GSM network.
It is connected via Abis interface to the
[[{{BASEPAGENAME}}#BTS|BTS]].
Upstream connection is to the MSC.
The BSC provides, classically, the intelligence behind the BTSs.

==BTS==
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_station_subsystem#Base_transceiver_station Base transceiver station]
([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_transceiver_station#General_Architecture BTS])
- This is the part between the MS and
[[{{BASEPAGENAME}}#BSC|BSC]]
in a GSM network.
It is interfaced to the
[[{{BASEPAGENAME}}#BSC|BSC]]
using the Abis protocol.

==FBGA==
FINE ball grid array - see
([[{{BASEPAGENAME}}#BGA]])

==FPGA==
A
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array field-programmable gate array (FPGA)]
is an integrated circuit designed to be configured by the customer or designer after manufacturingâ€”hence "field-programmable".
''(not used in v1)''

==GPRS==
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Packet_Radio_Service General packet radio service (GPRS)]
is a packet oriented mobile data service
on the 2G and 3G cellular communication system's
global system for mobile communications (GSM).

==GPS==
The
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System Global Positioning System (GPS)]
is a space-based global navigation satellite system (GNSS)
that provides location and time information in all weather,
anywhere on or near the Earth,
where there is an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS satellites.
It is maintained by the United States government and is freely accessible
by anyone with a GPS receiver
with some technical limitations which are only removed for military users.

==GTA01==
Internal codename of the first phone hardware release, the
[http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/GTA01:Neo_1973 Neo 1973].

==GTA02==
Internal codename of the second phone hardware release, the
[http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Neo_FreeRunner Neo FreeRunner].

==MCC==
An
Mobile Country Code (MCC)
is often used in combination with a
Mobile Network Code ([[{{BASEPAGENAME}}#MNC|MNC]])
(as a "MCC / MNC tuple")
in order to uniquely identify a network operator.

The MCC is part of the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) number,
which uniquely identifies a particular subscriber,
and is stored on a SIM card.

The current MCC
(i.e. the country in which the modem is now)
may also be obtained from a GSM/UMTS wireless modem
using the AT command AT+COPS.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mobile_country_codes#National_codes List of mobile country codes]
This is a list of Mobile Country Codes (MCCs)
defined in ITU E.212 ("Land Mobile Numbering Plan")
for use in identifying mobile stations in wireless telephone networks.

==MNC==
A Mobile Network Code (MNC) is used in combination with a
Mobile Country Code ([[{{BASEPAGENAME}}#MCC|MCC]])
(also known as a "MCC / MNC tuple")
to uniquely identify a mobile phone operator/carrier.
The ITU-T Recommendation E.212 defines mobile country codes.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Network_Code#National_operators List of mobile network codes]
This is a list of mobile phone operators.

==MSC==
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switching_subsystem#Mobile_switching_center_.28MSC.29 Mobile switching center (MSC)]
- A major component of the GSM Network.

==PLMN==
Acronym for
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_land_mobile_network Public Land Mobile Network]
what your mobile phone almost certainly connects to.

A PLMN is a regulatory term in telecommunications.
A PLMN is identified by the Mobile Country Code
([[{{BASEPAGENAME}}#MCC|MCC]])
and the Mobile Network Code
([[{{BASEPAGENAME}}#MNC|MNC]]).
Each operator providing mobile services has its own PLMN.

PLMNs interconnect with other PLMNs
and Public switched telephone networks (PSTN) for telephone communications
or with internet service providers for data and internet access
of which links are defined as interconnect links between providers.
These links mostly incorporate SDH digital transmission networks
via fibre optic on land and digital microwave links.
