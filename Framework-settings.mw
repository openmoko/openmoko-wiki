This is a gtk+ gui to control BT/WIFI/USB-HOST/GPRS and GSM (commented out in the code since for some reason GSM won't wake back up from a force disable) using [[FSO]].
Currently it enables to connect to GPRS by changing the APN/USER/PASS in the script headers (/usr/bin/fso-settings) which isn't the best idea, and will be changed soon, to either using a config file or fso perfenences (if possible)

The best way to get resources and release them would be by using the request/release or set policy for resources, though those APIs do not allow force disabling of an interface which wasn't what I needed at the time.

Future updates will include changing policies for devices which is a much more elegant way of forcing apps out.
Will hopefully soon support more settings implemented by the framework.
