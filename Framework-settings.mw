This is a gtk+ gui to control BT/WIFI/USB-HOST/GPRS and GSM (commented out in the code since for some reason GSM won't wake back up from a force disable) using [[FSO]].
Currently it enables to connect to GPRS by changing the APN/USER/PASS in the script headers (/usr/bin/fso-settings) which isn't the best idea, and will be changed soon, to either using a config file or fso perfenences (if possible)

The best way to get resources and release them would be by using the request/release or set policy for resources, though those APIs do not allow force disabling of an interface which wasn't what I needed at the time.

Future updates will include changing policies for devices which is a much more elegant way of forcing apps out.
Will hopefully soon support more settings implemented by the framework.

This package is a good complement to [[Siglaunchd]].
In that link there's a settings line in order to make it run this app after 1 or more seconds of holding the aux button.

= Package =
* author: Tom Hacohen <available_at_profile>
* this is a python script so code resides in /usr/bin/fso-settings
* link: [http://stosb.com/openmoko/fso-settings_0.3_armv4t.ipk 0.3.0 package]
* link: [http://stosb.com/openmoko/fso-settings_0.4_armv4t.ipk 0.4.0 package]
I'm keeping the old version available as well because the new version is rather hackish.


= Change Log =
'''0.4.0'''
* Hacked together the profile-changer so it can now change phone profiles
* The apn/user/password for gprs is now stored in a config file at /home/root/.fso-settings.conf
* The code got ugly because it's mostly a hack.
= TODO =
* also add a policy setting changer.
* change the gui to appear before dbus probes so launching wouldn't take so long.

= Known Issues=
* Power and settings are the same, that's just an infrastructure
