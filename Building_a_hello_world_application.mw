=== Preparation ===
This guide assumes that you have performed the steps in [[Building_OpenMoko_from_scratch]]

=== The commandline program ===
Store the following more or less standard hello world code in hello.c

 #include <stdio.h>
 
 int main()
 {
   printf ("Hello World\n");
   return 0;
 }

=== Compiling it the ''wrong'' way ===
Assuming your current working directory is '''/home/moko''',<br>
and that you stored the code in '''/home/moko/hello.c'''

It should now be possible to compile the application using
 ./build/tmp/cross/arm-linux/bin/gcc -o hello hello.c

==== Testing it ====
Assuming you have followed [[OpenMoko_under_QEMU#Setting_up_USB_connection|Setting up USB connection]] and you have a working network concetion to either a qemu Neo or a real Neo.
 scp hello root@192.168.0.202:/tmp/
 ssh root@192.168.0.202 /tmp/hello
This sequence of commands ought to give you a nice ''Hello World'', btw. the default root password is blank, just press return.
