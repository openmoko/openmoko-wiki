== Building openmoko-dialer3 ==
Currently this is the only package of any size being developed for SHR, and it's the only one with any instructions.  If you start another SHR project (please check with [[User:Wurp][Bobby]] before starting one), put instructions for working on the project here!

=== Before beginning ===
You must build openembedded before you can build SHR packages.  The easiest way is to go to http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Mokomakefile and build using the instructions for FSO.

The rest of these instructions are written assuming that you used Mokomakefile and that the directory you downloaded the base Makefile into (using wget) is $MOKO.

You must also download the SHR code using subversion.  See http://projects.openmoko.org/projects/shr.  We will refer to the directory to which you downloaded the project as $SHRSVN.  (This directory should contain $SHRSVN/packages/openmoko-dialer3.bb)

=== Set up your BBPATH ===

  export BBPATH=.:$MOKO/openembedded/:$MOKO/bitbake/:$MOKO/:$SHRSVN/trunk/packages/

=== Set up the CACHE ===

  export CACHE=tmp/cache



=== Set up your local.conf ===
Cd to your selected build directory.

Create a directory under your current directory called 'conf'.

  cp $MOKO/openembedded/conf/local.conf conf/local.conf.

Append the following lines to your local.conf:
  BBFILES += "$SHRSVN/trunk/packages/*.bb $MOKO/openembedded/packages/*/*.bb"
  SELECTED_OPTIMIZATION = "-Os -g"

''Note: Spaces are important in your bitbake conf files!  You must have spaces before & after the = or +=''

=== Add your cross-compiler to your PATH ===

  export PATH=$MOKO/build/tmp/cross/bin/:$MOKO/build/tmp/staging/x86_64-linux/usr/bin:$PATH

=== Run bitbake ===

  bitbake openmoko-dialer3

=== To recompile, and only recompile ===

   bitbake -c compile -b $SHRSVN/trunk/packages/openmoko-dialer3.bb

=== Troubleshooting ===

==== General ====
One thing to try is to unset all environment variables not listed in this page.  LIBPATH and INCLUDE can be particularly troublesome.
