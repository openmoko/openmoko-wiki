== Building openmoko-dialer3 ==
Currently this is the only package of any size being developed for SHR, and it's the only one with any instructions.  If you start another SHR project (please check with [[User:Wurp|Bobby]] before starting one), put instructions for working on the project here!

=== Before beginning ===
You must build openembedded before you can build SHR packages.  The easiest way is to go to http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Mokomakefile and build using the instructions for FSO.

 * Note: if building FSO fails using MokoMakefile (zhone! or no dbus show up on the top of the newly booted image), try using this
   method: http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/FSO

The rest of these instructions are written assuming that you used Mokomakefile and that the directory you downloaded the base Makefile into (using wget) is $MOKO.

You must also download the SHR code using subversion.  See http://projects.openmoko.org/projects/shr.  We will refer to the directory to which you downloaded the project as $SHRSVN.  (This directory should contain $SHRSVN/packages/openmoko-dialer3.bb)

=== Set up your BBPATH ===

  export BBPATH=.:$MOKO/openembedded/:$MOKO/bitbake/:$MOKO/:$SHRSVN/trunk/packages/

=== Set up the CACHE ===

  export CACHE=tmp/cache



=== Set up your local.conf ===
Cd to $MOKO/openembedded

Append the following lines to conf/local.conf:
  BBFILES += "$SHRSVN/trunk/packages/*.bb $MOKO/openembedded/packages/*/*.bb"
  SELECTED_OPTIMIZATION = "-Os -g"

''Note: Spaces are important in your bitbake conf files!  You must have spaces before & after the = or +=''

=== Set up your openmoko.conf (if using 2007.2) ===

edit $MOKO/openembedded/conf/distro/openmoko.conf

and make sure that these Gtk+ options are set:

 # Select package versions we want to use.
 PREFERRED_PROVIDER_gtk+ = "gtk+-fastscaling"
 PREFERRED_VERSION_gtk+-fastscaling = "2.10.14"


=== Add your cross-compiler to your PATH ===

  export PATH=$MOKO/build/tmp/cross/bin/:$MOKO/build/tmp/staging/x86_64-linux/usr/bin:$PATH

=== Run bitbake ===

  bitbake openmoko-dialer3

After the first time you build successfully, you can build with

  bitbake -b openmoko-dialog3_svn

which is much faster.

=== To recompile, and only recompile ===

   bitbake -c compile -b $SHRSVN/trunk/packages/openmoko-dialer3.bb

=== Troubleshooting ===

==== General ====
One thing to try is to unset all environment variables not listed in this page.  LIBPATH and INCLUDE can be particularly troublesome.
