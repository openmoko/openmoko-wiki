==Distributions==
{{DistributionBox|
Name=QtMoko|
Description=QtMoko is a Debian-based distribution for the Openmoko Freerunner phone. Phone and user interface are based on QT Extended, formerly known as Qtopia. This should be the best QtMoko image so far. We have all Freerunner hardware working (with some small glitches) and also as a phone it should be very usable. Now we have a growing number of packages in the qtmoko-apps repository and also it is possible to access endless packages from Debian. There seems to be a bug with sometimes losing SMS messages. It would be great if someone managed to find out how to reproduce this issue or send AT log. This can be either a kernel bug (phone does not wake up and the operator gives up on delivering message?) or something in Qtopia (the message arrives but gets lost) or a combination of these two. Changes from previous version:
* Fixed no sound in incoming calls
* Fixed wifi - now should work ok (many thanks to Paul Ferster)
* New package repository and package feed (thanks to Ant)
* Improved fonts - using now truetype fonts which can handle diacritics and look better. In terminal it's now possible to set fixed size font.
* Fixes in QtMaze (thanks to Ant)
* Improved look - using now icons instead of text
* Improved speed for switching alsa scenarios
* Added script for sharing GPRS connection with PC
* Disabled dimming by default when on cable
* Upgraded kernel to latest andy-tracking
<br>So enjoy, thanks to everyone who helped with this release and let Radek Polak know how you like it.|

{{ApplicationBox|
Name=atd-over-fso|
Description=Łukasz Pankowski has uploaded new release of atd-over-fso. It fixes problem with atd exiting during system start up. Now atd-over-fso is waiting for org.freesmartphone.otimed instead of exiting if it is not available on first call to SetAlarm. The previous behavior caused atd to exit during system start up if frameworkd has not yet started org.freesmartphone.otimed and at least one alarm was set (left from previous system run or before otimed was ready).|

* Álvaro Lopes decided to create a '''[http://gta02-core-news.blogspot.com/ blog]''' to post weekly news about the '''gta02-core''' project. Lets hope this will attract those that hate emails and reading through email lists. Information contained there is supposed to be pretty much summarized, quick to read, easy to understand, change log of what is happening out there.
* Kerstin Balka is doing an research on open source influencing the community and the project includes Openmoko. '''[http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2009-September/055202.html Go and aswer the poll!]'''
* David Lanzendörfer has built an optimized rootfs for '''[[Openmoko_on_HTC-Dream|Openmoko on HTC-Dream]]'''. Currrently sound and wifi does not work but he claim this will be fixed soon, so it should soon get in usable state.
* Thomas Landspurg informs that they have '''successfully integrated CellHunter data into the OpenCellID database.''' The database has now more than 570 000 cells for 48 310 000 measures. The signal strength field has been imported, as well the "gname" which is the name of the team who has created the measures. Thanks to Sebastian Hammer of CellsHunter for helping out, and to all the cell hunters!
