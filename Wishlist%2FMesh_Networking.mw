== Introduction ==

Mesh networking allows communication with others without the need for network
infrastructure such as cellular base stations or wireless access points.
A mesh network treats everyone's computer as a wireless router and learns about 
the links in the network, computes paths between all users, and updates the IP
routing tables so that you can send packets to anyone else who is part
of the mobile ad-hoc network (MANet). 

== Hardware ==

The minimal requirement to run Mesh networking is having at least one network interface configured.
A WLAN or Bluetooth network interface can be used for this (actually you could use a wired 
interface but you won't be very mobile then!).

== Software ==

There is different software out there supporting Mesh networking.

=== Netsukuku ===

[http://netsukuku.freaknet.org/ Netsukuku] is a mesh network or a p2p net system that generates and sustains
itself autonomously. It is designed to handle an unlimited number of nodes
with minimal CPU and memory resources.

  Note: from the [http://netsukuku.freaknet.org/files/doc/misc/Ntk_features_list Ntk features list]
  The design of Netsukuku prioritises the stability of net.
  For this reason, it isn't specifically suitable for mobile nodes.
  However if the mobile nodes are inside an area covered by static Netsukuku
  nodes, there aren't any problems. It is also possible to use other mesh
  network protocols designed for mobility in conjunction with Netsukuku

=== Mobile Mesh ===

[http://www.mitre.org/work/tech_transfer/mobilemesh/ Mobile Mesh] has been developed for mobile
ad-hoc routing protocols. Mobile Mesh is developed part of a research project at The MITRE Corporation.

=== LUNAR ===

[http://core.it.uu.se/core/index.php/LUNAR LUNAR] stands for Lightweight Underlay Network Ad-hoc Routing
and implements a bare-bones on-demand route discovery protocol with broadcast dampening and reconfigures
communications paths typically within 3 seconds. LUNAR includes automatic IP gatewaying and supports 
IP unicast and broadcast. A dedicated [http://core.it.uu.se/core/index.php/LUNAR_over_Bluetooth LUNAR over Bluetooth] version is available running over a Bluetooth network using BlueZ.


== Routing protocols ==

=== AODV ===
[http://moment.cs.ucsb.edu/AODV/aodv.html AODV] is a routing protocol very light in term of power and energy consumption; it provides at the support for mobility.
It is a proactive algorithm, so it does not send any message if you don't need, and that is good for comsumption

=== B.A.T.M.A.N. ===
[http://open-mesh.net/batman/documentation/Overview B.A.T.M.A.N.] is the latest routing protocol developed by enthusiasts around the world. Initial algorithm design was done by Elektra from the [http://berlin.freifunk.net freifunk.net community Berlin].

Each B.A.T.M.A.N (better approach to mobile ad-hoc networking) node stores routing information about the neighbouring node it can reach. If because of packet loss etc. another node cannot be reached it will not be part of the local node's routing information.

B.A.T.M.A.N Advanced is the next generation implementation that works on the Ethernet layer instead of the IP layer. That way the mesh-net can be seen as an ethernet switch allowing easier node to node setups and providing services ''inside'' the mesh-net.

A German article can be found [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.A.T.M.A.N. here].

=== 802.11s ===
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11s 802.11s] is a draft IEEE 802.11 amendment for mesh networking, defining how wireless devices can interconnect to create an ad-hoc network. It extends the IEEE 802.11 MAC standard by defining an architecture and protocol that support both broadcast/multicast and unicast delivery using "radio-aware metrics over self-configuring multi-hop topologies."
