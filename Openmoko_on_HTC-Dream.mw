== Introduction ==
HTC-Dream is a android based handy.
Android is running on top of a linux kernel.
So we have basically no work to to then using this kernel to boot an OpenMoko userspace.
This work is done.
I bootet an OpenMoko userspace.
The way to do it your own is described next.

== Bootloader ==
You need to install fastboot.
In order to do this, you will have need to root the existing android or have already a developer version installed.

== Building new kernel ==
Use 2.6.29 from android.git.kernel.org 2.6.27 rebootet after some minutes without reason.

 git clone git://android.git.kernel.org/kernel/msm.git
 wget http://wiki.openmoko.org/images/3/3b/Openmoko-htc-dream-kernel-config.txt
 cp Openmoko-htc-dream-kernel-config.txt msm/.config
 cd msm
 make CROSS_COMPILE=/usr/local/openmoko/arm/arm-angstrom-linux-gnueabi/bin/ ARCH=arm

== Building boot.img ==
 mkbootimg --cmdline "console=tty0 no_console_suspend=1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootdelay=2 fbcon=rotate:1" \
 --kernel /home/leviathan/android-msm-2.6.29/msm/arch/arm/boot/zImage \
 --ramdisk /home/leviathan/Downloads/split_bootimg/newramdisk.cpio.gz -o openmoko-boot.img
