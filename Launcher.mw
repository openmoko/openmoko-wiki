Launcher provides an elegant way of grouping and launching applications. It features events notification too - missed calls and messages at the moment. It also has built in apps for contacts, sms and phonelog.

It is aimed at [[OpenmokoFramework|FSO framework]] based distributions, mainly [[SHR|SHR]]. SHR-Launcher and Launcher in this page do refer to the same app.
