 apart from two differences, [the S3C2442B] is software/register-wise exactly
 identical to the s3c2440.  Hardware-wise it is packaged with 64MByte
 (x32) SDRAM and depending on the type, 128/256MByte NAND flash (2k page
 size).
 
 The differences are:
 
 1) all pull-up resistors (GPBUP, ...) are now pull-down
 2) the default initializers for the PLL have changed
