== What is Mofi? ==

Mofi is software for the OpenMoko platform allowing phone users to search for and connect to available wireless access points (APs)

== Where can I download Mofi? ==

Mofi is available on the OpenMoko forge at http://projects.openmoko.org/projects/mofi/

== More Information ==

Mofi is written in Python and leverages the PyGTK library. Mofi stores AP passwords in a configuration file, scans APs within range and generates a wpa_supplicant.conf from the information found. The system then uses the wpa_supplicant.conf to connect to the first accessible AP.

The Gnome UI can be used to view available access points, and specify which access point is preferred.

Information on the project can be found on the Moko forge at http://projects.openmoko.org/projects/mofi/ 

An RSS feed is also available at http://feeds.feedburner.com/MofiProjectNewsOpenMokoProjects containing latest news for the project.
