== What is Mofi? ==

Mofi is software for the Openmoko platform allowing phone users to search for and connect to available wireless access points (APs)

== Where can I download Mofi? ==

Mofi is available on the Openmoko forge at http://projects.openmoko.org/projects/mofi/

Download the latest '''package''' at http://projects.openmoko.org/frs/download.php/277/mofi_0.02_armv4t.ipk

or alternatively, get the '''source''' from http://projects.openmoko.org/frs/download.php/271/mofi.0.02.tar.gz

See [[ #Installation ]] for info on how to install Mofi..

== More Information ==

Mofi is written in Python and leverages the PyGTK library. Mofi stores AP passwords in a configuration file, scans APs within range and generates a wpa_supplicant.conf from the information found. The system then uses the wpa_supplicant.conf to connect to the first accessible AP.

The Gnome UI can be used to view available access points, and specify which access point is preferred.

Information on the project can be found on the Moko forge at http://projects.openmoko.org/projects/mofi/ 

An RSS feed is also available at http://feeds.feedburner.com/MofiProjectNewsOpenmokoProjects containing latest news for the project.

== Using Mofi ==

One change enables the disconnect functionality in 0.03 beta, which greatly increases the usability of Mofi.  Just add the following to the end of <code>/usr/lib/mofi/disconnect.sh</code>

 killall wpa_supplicant
 killall udhcpc

This makes it possible to (I believe) shut down the wifi to conserve battery.  You should also be able to connect at home, use the wifi, then disconnect, take the phone to your local wifi hotspot, then connect again, without trouble (I'm using FSO, and have yet to test the hotspot theory, however).

== Installation ==

=== Through opkg ===

just scp the [http://projects.openmoko.org/frs/download.php/277/mofi_0.02_armv4t.ipk ipk] to your FreeRunner, then install using opkg:

 scp mofi_0.02_armv4t.ipk  root@192.168.0.202:/tmp/
 
 ssh root@192.168.0.202
  > cd /tmp/
  > opkg install mofi_0.02_armv4t.ipk

To run on your FreeRunner:

from the main menu choose the Applications section then "Wifi Mofi". Alternatively, mofi can be run from the console by typing ''mofi''

=== From source ===

You'll have to add some dependencies:

 opkg install python-core python-misc python-lang python-subprocess python-threading python-pygtk python-pygobject

there are some more, but when you try to run these will be indicated.. please post the additional dependencies to the project bug list, cheers:

http://projects.openmoko.org/tracker/?atid=710&group_id=165&func=browse

run ''./install.sh'' - this will set up the environment and move files to your freerunner. note you may have to change the value of FREERUNNER to point to the correct IP..


then to run mofi open the console on your FreeRunner and type ''mofi.sh''


You can also download the '''nightly SVN tree snapshot''' from https://projects.openmoko.org/snapshots.php?group_id=165

== If Mofi crahes ==
Mofi sometimes crashes with:

 Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/mofi/mofi_gui.py", line 30, in <module>
    import gtk
  File "/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/gtk-2.0/gtk/__init__.py", line 82,
 in <module>
    init()
 NameError: name 'init' is not defined

If this happens, edit the file /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/gtk-2.0/gtk/__init__.py and change the call to init() on line 82 to _init().
