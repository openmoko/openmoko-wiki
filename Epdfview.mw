==== Descripton ====
The program epdfview is PDF reader for handhelds using gtk+ and libpoppler. 

See also [[Reader]] for a general book reading applicaion. (unimplemented)

==== Build ====
It can be build using the extra DISTRO_EXTRA_RDEPENDS epdfview in build/conf/local.conf.

There is a binary version available for download [http://www.ginguppin.de/node/18 here] (at your own risk). However when I tried to install it on the new om2008.8 distribution I got:

<pre>
root@om-gta02:/var/volatile/tmp# opkg install epdfview_0.1.6-r2_armv4t.ipk
