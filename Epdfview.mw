==== Descripton ====
The program epdfview is PDF reader for handhelds using gtk+ and libpoppler.

Alternatively, evince is in the standard repos, if you don't mind some gnome dependencies - only a few megabytes.

==== Build ====
It can be build using the extra DISTRO_EXTRA_RDEPENDS epdfview in build/conf/local.conf.

There is a binary version available for download [http://www.ginguppin.de/node/18 here] (at your own risk). You may need to install libglib-2.0-0 (>= 2.16.4), libcairo2 (>= 1.6.4). Read below how to install the missing packages.

There is a newer version available [http://www.ginguppin.de/node/21 here].

<pre>
cd /tmp
wget http://www.ginguppin.de/files/epdfview_poppler.tar.bz2
wget http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/feeds/2008/ipk/glibc/armv4t/base/libfreetype6_2.3.6-r0.1_armv4t.ipk
opkg install libfreetype6_2.3.6-r0_armv4t.ipk
opkg install libpoppler3_0.8.4-r0_armv4t.ipk
opkg install poppler_0.8.4-r0_armv4t.ipk

opkg install epdfview_0.1.6-r3_armv4t.ipk
</pre>

Unfortunately the last command still fails missing the packages:
<pre>
* ERROR: Cannot satisfy the following dependencies for libpoppler-glib3:
libglib-2.0-0 (>= 2.16.4) *  gtk+ (>= 2.12.11) *  libcairo2 (>= 1.6.4) *  libpoppler-glib3 (>= 0.8.4)

Please note that missing packages is a subjective problem, depending on previous programs that were/weren't installed.
</pre>

The problem can be fixed searching and downloading the missing packages with [[KnjMokoOPKG]] available [http://www.opkg.org/package_165.html Here]. You may also issue the simple "$ opkg install <name of package>" in terminal once connected to Internet, or search http://www.opkg.org/packages/ for a package. The next step involves writing:
opkg install http://www.ginguppin.de/files/epdfview_0.1.6-r2_armv4t.ipk
in Terminal to install the PDF Viewer (or choose whatever method you prefer).

You can find a patched version with an additional page-scrolling feature at http://www.opkg.org/package_193.html.

The most reecent version of libglib-2.0-dev that I could find for armv4 is [http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/feeds/2008/ipk/glibc/armv4t/base/ 2.16.3-r0].
