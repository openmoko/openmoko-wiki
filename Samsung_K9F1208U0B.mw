* Connected to: [[Samsung S3C2410]] NAND controller

This is the only flash memory in the device.  The [[Samsung S3C2410]] boots directly from nand, using the [[S3C2410 Steppingstone]].

We only use free software, no proprietary flash file systems.  For a full description of how it is used, see [[NAND bad blocks]]
