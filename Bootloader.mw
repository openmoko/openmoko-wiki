{{Languages|Bootloader}}

On cold start or warm start the  '''bootloader''' is a small program that start up the main operating system.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootloader]

The Openmoko phones can use [[U-Boot]] (Openmoko default), [[U-boot-gena2x]] or [[Qi]] as bootloaders. Qi and U-boot-gena2x is actively developed, while the Openmoko version of U-Boot is not.

The default bootloader of the [[Neo 1973]] is [[U-Boot]]. The bootloader of the Neo 1973 can be modified, but this is only recommended if a [[debug board]] is available.

The [[Neo FreeRunner]] has two bootloaders. The [[NOR Flash]] contains a version of U-Boot which cannot be modified. Therefore it is always available as a fallback, and the second (NAND-)bootloader can be modified without any risk. This bootloader can be booted into by pressing and holding the AUX button and then pressing the Power button.

Note that the NOR bootloader has a size limit of 2 MB for the kernel. The NAND u-boot loader has the same limit, but you could rather easily increase it by modifying the [[Bootloader_environment|u-boot environment]].
