{{Languages|Bootloader}}

The '''bootloader''' is a small program to start up the main operating system. The Openmoko phones can use [[U-Boot]] or [[Qi]] as bootloaders. Qi is actively developed, while the Openmoko version of U-Boot is not.

The default bootloader of the [[Neo 1973]] is U-Boot. The bootloader of the Neo 1973 can be modified, but this is only recommended if a [[debug board]] is available.

The [[Neo FreeRunner]] has two bootloaders. The [[NOR Flash]] contains a version of U-Boot which cannot be modified. Therefore it is always available as a fallback, and the second bootloader can be modified without any risk. This bootloader can be booted into by pressing and holding the AUX button and then pressing the Power button.
