== Overview ==
Blackherd Bluetooth is a simple Bluetooth application. It includes a simple adapter manager, OBEX file browser and OBEX push support. It is written using Python and Elementary.

== Features ==

* Basic Bluetooth adapter manager (switching discoverable mode, etc.)
* Device discovery, pairing with other Bluetooth devices
* Sending files using OBEX object push
* Browsing OBEX FTP on other devices, downloading and uploading files
* Mostly finger friendly

== Download and installation ==

=== Repository access ===

As there are no official releases, Blackherd Bluetooth is only through Bazaar. To download the source code, use
<pre>bzr branch lp:blackherd</pre>

=== Installation ===

There are currently no packages for any distribution, so it has to be installed manually, or run from the source code directory directly.

Manual installation doesn't require any additional libraries, as the application is pure-Python. It can be performed with

<pre>
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
</pre>

If pollution of the root filesystem isn't desired, it can be launched directly from the source code directory with 
<pre>
python ./blackherd-ebluetooth
</pre>


== Dependences ==
* dbus-python
* python-ecore
* python-edbus
* python-elementary
* lightblue
* (Python 2.5 only) pyprocessing or multiprocessing backport from 2.6

It has not be tested on anything but Python 2.5.

== Configuration ==

Blackherd is configured using the ~/.blackherd/eblackherd.cfg configuration file. Here's an example
of this file suitable for using Blackherd Bluetooth on the Openmoko phones.
