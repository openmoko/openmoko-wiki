''Note: This is the (ongoing) description of the new framework architecture that is '''in development'''. See [[OpenmokoOldFramework]] for the framework architecture of 2007.1 and 2007.2 and [[NeoSoftwareStack]] for the current status (which has nothing to do yet with this framework)''

=Purposes=
* '''Give people the infrastructure to create solid and exciting software products based on the Openmoko platform'''
* '''Support competing UIs while collaborating on developing services'''
* '''Encourage framework users (e.g. application developers) to also contribute to the framework'''

=Requirements=
* Make it simple
* Concentrate on core services
* Be programming language agnostic
* Be UI toolkit agnostic
* Try to reuse existing technologies as much as possible, but not at the cost of a bad API

=How to achieve that technically=
* 选择[[D-Bus]]作为协同开发分界线。Dbus下层，我们合作开发，Dbus上层，我们使用不同的方式实现。
* Expose features through dbus APIs implemented by UI-agnostic and language-agnostic services (daemons).
* Optimize for Openmoko devices, but support multiple architectures and purposes through plugin interfaces and suitable hardware abstraction mechanisms.
* Be not afraid of reinventing the wheel for a wheel-barrow if all the existing wheels are made for sports cars.

=What this is NOT about=
This initiative does not cover low level services such as
* Bootloader, Kernel, or System Init.

This initiative does not cover high level services such as
* X-Window-System, Window Manager, UI Toolkits,
* Application Launchers, Applications, or Fancy UIs.

=Architectural Overview=
[[Image:OpenmokoFramework08.png |823px|frontside]]

=Software Components=

We differenciate between low-level and high-level services -- dbus will be used to communicate horizontally and vertically.

===底层服务===

====设备控制====
底层设备控制服务管理周边外设, 例如: 控制每一个子系统的如
* GSM, WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, as well as
* 背景灯亮度和电源，
* LED灯的开/关，
* 充电, 待机/恢复,
* accellerometers, and buttons.
监听用户的活动来实现
* 进入到省电模式，或
* 锁定设备.
我们用下边的程序来实现：

====Audio====
The low level audio service relies on a working alsa device driver. On top of that, there are two components:
# [http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/ gstreamer]
# [http://pulseaudio.org pulseaudio]

'''Gstreamer''' is to be used for all kinds of event sounds where a) multiple audio formats need to be supported and b) a latency of about one second is acceptable. This goes for e.g. ring tones, welcome tones, plug indication.

'''Pulseaudio''' is to be used for event sounds, where low-latency is necessary, e.g. touch click sounds and UI event acknowledge sounds. Pulseaudio is our general all-purpose mixer. Gstreamer will use the pulseaudio sink to feed audio through.

====GSM====
The low level GSM services expect a modem complying to GSM 07.07, GSM 07.05, and assorted GSM specifications, talking an AT-protocol over a serial line. If GSM 07.10 is supported, we use the multiplexing daemon
* [http://www.freesmartphone.org/index.php/Implementations/gsm0710muxd gsm0710muxd]
to export virtual serial lines over -- again -- AT-protocol can be spoken.

====蓝牙====
底层蓝牙实现依赖于linux核心实现的bluez蓝牙栈框架:
* [http://www.bluez.org BlueZ].

====GPS====
The low level GPS services assume a GPS device that talks NMEA over a device node. We rely on the following software:
* [http://gypsy.freedesktop.org Gypsy]

====网络====
底层网络服务实现网络接口，例如USB，以太网，Wifi等。We rely on the following software here:
* Network Manager or Intel Connection Manager (undecided yet)
* ppp

===High Level===

====Usage====
The Usage subsystem is coordinating application I/O requirements preventing. Applications are not supposed to turn on or off devices, since they do not have any knowledge about concurrent applications that may be also using the device -- think ''reference counting'' for I/O requirements.

With this added layer, we could later think about monitoring subsystems, subsystem usage statistics, or accounting.

See discussion page about PolicyKit.

====事件====
* 经由I/O的事件信号(掁铃, 闪烁, 掁动)
* 可能使用 fd.o 通知 API

====PIM====
一个智能存储数据库. This is being carried out as a Google Summer of Code project. See complete description [http://www.neo1973-germany.de/wiki/pyPimd here]

====Context====
* Intelligent context API, integrating location as one -- among other -- sources
TBD
Reference Geoclue

====电信业务====
* 语音
* 数据

=== [http://www.freesmartphone.org/index.php/Implementations/OpenPreferencesDaemon Preferences] ===
* 配置数据库

====网络====
* 高级网络请求

=The role of Python=

在启用新代码时，我们使用Python脚本实现dbus服务。这么做可以快带原型实现 The reason for that being the rapid prototyping nature of Python and the emphasis on the Dbus APIs. Using Python, the turnaround times to experiment with APIs are incredibly faster than for using a compiled language such as C or C++.

Once the APIs have been used by application programmers, we can start profiling and possibly reimplement some of the services with daemons written in Vala, ''if'' necessary. We might as well succeed in improving performance by using Pyrex/Cython/Ctypes to keep the benefits of Python.

=Team & Roadmap=

==Team==

* [[User:Mickey|Michael 'Mickey' Lauer]] (team leader) -- Openmoko freelancer, working in Frankfurt/Main, Germany.
* [[User:Charlie| Guillaume 'Charlie' Chereau]] -- Openmoko employee, working fulltime in the Openmoko office, Taipei, Taiwan.
* [[User:Shoragan|Jan 'Shoragan' Luebbe]] -- Openmoko student, working part-time in Brunswick, Germany.
* [[User:DanielWillmann|Daniel 'Alphaone' Willmann]] -- Openmoko student, working part-time in Brunswick, Germany.
* (Holger 'Zecke' Freyther -- hopefully joining the team after releasing ASU, working in Berlin, Germany.)

'''Subsystem Ownership'''

''第一阶段子系统''

* odeviced (mickey)
* ophoned (mickey)
* ousaged (jan)
* oeventd (jan)
* opreferencesd (guillaume)
* ocontextd (guillaume)

''Phase 2 subsystems''

* 网络 (to be defined)
* pim (to be defined)

==Roadmap==

The milestone releases are combined Openmoko Framework and [[Zhone]] releases. Remember: A feature that isn't visible, working, and tested in our framework testing application (Zhone) does ''not'' exist. Until Framework 1.0.0 (later this year), we will not use any versioning in components. Afterwards, individual components may see individual releases.

'''Note: The milestones and tasks moved over to our [http://trac.freesmartphone.org issue tracker].'''
