== Overview ==
This page describes the set of core applications '''currently''' included in Openmoko.  Additional/Community Apps listed here is limited to popular apps under consideration for inclusion into the core.

Additional apps are also accessible from the Terminal.  These '''will not''' be included here.  This list is aimed toward apps included in the GUI and Basic Use.  If an app gets a gui & is added to '''Launch Tasks''', then it can be added here.

Community applications may be found on the [[Wish_List|Wish List]], [[OpenMoko_Community_Applications | Openmoko Featured Apps]], and on [http://projects.openmoko.org projects.openmoko.org]
