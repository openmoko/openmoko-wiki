Hello Community,

I've just arrived in Taiwan and have figured out the quad band issue.

The chipset is capable of quad band but the board was laid out to only support 3 bands. So, 850Mhz is not supported on the GTA01 board. Instead we support 900/1800/1900MHz.

Anyone interested in more details is welcome to email me.

Michael
