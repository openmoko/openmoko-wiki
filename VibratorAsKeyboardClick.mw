== Vibrator as keyboard click ==

The Neo only has a touch screen which makes it hard to feel if a key is pressed. A click sound can help, but sound can be annoying to your environment. Visual feedback helps, but it would be nice to feel it too.

You could have the phone move slightly if the vibrator is activated for a very short time (e.g. 50 ms). This would give a silent, yet distinctive feedback.
