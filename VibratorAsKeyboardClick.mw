== Vibrator as keyboard click ==

The Neo only has a touch screen which makes it hard to feel if a key is pressed. A click sound can help, but sound can be annoying to your environment. Visual feedback helps, but it would be nice to feel it too.

You could have the phone move slightly if the vibrator is activated for a very short time (e.g. 50 ms). This would give a silent, yet distinctive feedback.

The could be extended so the sound and the visual emphasized this. See http://www.time4.com/time4/microsites/popsci/howitworks/cellphone_motor.html for more about this.
