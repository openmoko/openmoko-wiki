The display locker is an extension of [[neod]] which intends to prevent accidentially caused triggering of events on the screen.

== Use case ==
Willi wants to hear music when he is jogging, but he can't
because "lock down" gets his neo in suspend mode where he can't here
music and "dim only" won't prevent accidental triggering of events in his
pocket.

== Idea ==
Make an uncloseable widget, which can only be hidden when the user 
draws a specific motion on the screen.

== Realisation ==
The user has to drag something from the buttom of the screen to the top of the screen.
'''The display locker is now in mainline [[OpenMoko]].'''

If you have any ideas or a fancy new image set, please contact me ("borg" in #openmoko or olaf@uni-paderborn.de).

== Themes ==

The following themes are available: To install one, just put the .png's in the <tt>/usr/share/neod/</tt> folder of your neo.
