This page is mostly useful for developers and power users. If you are looking for a kernel to flash into your GTA01/GTA02 you might want to check the [[Distributions]] page instead. If you are impatient and want to flash a kernel you will find prebuilt bootable kernel images called ''uImage*'' here: http://downloads.openmoko.org/distro/releases/

== General ==
