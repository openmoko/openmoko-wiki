This page will eventually replace the [[Kernel]] page.

This page is mostly useful for developers and power/curious users. If you are looking for a kernel to flash into your GTA01/GTA02 you might want to check the [[Distributions]] page instead. If you are really serious about finding a working kernel right away with no context whatsoever you will find prebuilt bootable kernel images called ''uImage*'' here: http://downloads.openmoko.org/distro/releases/

== General ==

External Linux kenel developers and [[Openmoko]] Linux kernel developers provide a working kernel for the [[Freerunner]] (Also known as GTA02) and also for the [[Neo1973]] (Aka GTA01).

Right now there is an ongoing effort to reduce the distance between current Linux 2.6 (mainline) and the kernel in the Openmoko repository and thanks to this work we can run the most recent released version of Linux 2.6.

== Sources ==

The sources of the Openmoko Linux kernel live in a GIT repository.

[http://git-scm.com GIT] is a fast version control system suited for the workflow that many kernel developers use. It is specially useful when you need to send patches for a project (who might in turn might need to send them upstream). This is an over-simplification but it gives you the idea in case you did not know.

Git might seem complicated at first but once you learn to use you will find many ways to increase your productivity by using it. For completeness in this page we include the GIT commands that you need in order to build a working kernel.

If you are very new to git you might want to read [http://git.or.cz/course/ good manuals already available].

If you would like to contribute code we also have a page with [[Hints_on_using_GIT_and_stgit]] where we all hope to share some cool tips and tricks that can help you. You do not need to learn stgit in order to send patches to the Kernel Mailing List but we have to tell you that once you know git stgit will make you more productive.

=== Branches ===

GIT allows for different branches that developers use to speed up development. We might have noticed we have a few of them if you visited the web interface (http://git.openmoko.org/?p=kernel.git;a=summary).

The andy-tracking branch is the one where most of the action takes place these days.

== Contributing ==

The development resources [[Openmoko]] offers are:

* Git repository: http://git.openmoko.org/?p=kernel.git;a=summary
* [http://lists.openmoko.org/mailman/listinfo/openmoko-kernel Mailing list] ([http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/openmoko-kernel/ Online Archive])

We appreciate your contributions. Check the Open Issues at the end of this page to check where we need more help.

If in doubt ask in the mailing list.

== Known issues ==

Some issues might be very difficult because of lack of (correct) documentation from the hardware makers or because not many people are used to dealing with them. If you can help us with one of those issues it would be great.
