{{Distributions|SHR}}

'''SHR''' (Stable Hybrid Release) is a community driven distribution based on the [[FSO]] framework. SHR can use several different graphical toolkits, for example GTK or EFL. At first, SHR was introduced in order to use the [[Om 2007.2]] GTK software in combination with the new FSO, but things have changed.

== Setting local time ==
As any linux system, the UTC time is used by the system. First of all, adjust this time:
 date -u -s 010220052009
 Fri Jan  2 20:05:00 UTC 2009

Then, you need to "localise" your system. 
Search for the appropriate country with:
 opkg list | grep tzdata

then install the one corresponding to your area. 
 opkg install tzdata-europe

Then select your city (search the city available in /usr/share/zoneinfo/your-country, example Paris)
 ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Paris /etc/localtime

You can fully localise your system by installing the glibc-binary-localedata correponding to your langage. Search the ones available with:
 opkg list | grep glibc-binary-localedata

install with (example for France)
 opkg install glibc-binary-localedata-fr-fr



== Customize the RingTone ==
You need to have a file containing the RingTone you want for your FR. You can find some at [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Ringtones#svn.openmoko.org_ringtones RingTone]

Then transfer it to your FR :
 scp file root@192.168.0.202:/usr/share/sounds/

Now you can select ringtone in SHR Settings.

== Install PIM Software ==
If you want to use your iCal-Calendar data on your freerunner install "dates" on your FR. Your FR needs internet connection for the following installation procedure (see [[USB Networking]])
  opkg update
  opkg install dates tasks
Start dates once and enter a test event. You will find the <tt>calendar.ics</tt> file in a subdirectory of 
  /home/root/.evolution/calendar/system/local
You can find the <tt>tasks.ics</tt> file in a subdirectory of 
  /home/root/.evolution/tasks/system/local
Copy your exported iCal-File to that folders mentioned above and replace <tt>calender.ics</tt> and <tt>tasks.ics</tt>. The events will be visible in PIM-software <i>dates</i>, when you restart your freerunner. 

<b>Question:</b> Is there a workaround to make the application <tt>dates</tt> and <tt>tasks</tt> to reload the iCal files during runtime?

== Sound Control ==

=== Mic and HP ===
The first idea is to use alsamixer; bad idea! There are 94 controls, and your modifications will be lost at the next reboot.Finding documentation is not easy. Here is my understanding: 
Scenari are used for each case. They are located in /usr/share/shr/scenarii/
- capturehandset.state  
- gsmheadset.state 
- headset.state         
- voip-handset.state
- gsmhandset.state
- gsmspeakerout.state
- stereoout.state

Each file is a set of value for the 94 parameters. I have identified some:

- Control 48: internal mic of the tel (set to 2 or 3)

- Control 4 : internal speaker (set from 110 to 120)

- Control 49: headset mic

- Control 3 : headset speaker

NOTE: every Neo seems to be different regarding audio. Probably you have to tweak your own audio config.

Generic info to the Neo soundsystem:

* [[Neo 1973 audio subsystem]]
* [[Neo alsamixer#Settings_Descriptions|Neo alsamixer - Settings Descriptions]]
* [[Neo Freerunner audio subsystem]]

== Known Issues ==

=== Address Book ===

SHR is not implementing a PIM (Personal Information Manager) yet. Work is in progress, but to included in SHR testing this has some consequences on daily use:

* Only contacts on the SIM card are available.

* It is not possible to import a Vcard file.
** It seems to be possible with [gopher://gopher.fnordpol.de/9/data/DbusAccessScripts_0.0.0.tar.gz this] script written by [[User:Zem#DBus_Access_Scripts|Zem]].

=== No ringing ===

After a suspend, the FR does not ringing anymore for incoming calls, it only vibrates. This is due to navit. To correct this :
  opkg remove -force-depends speech-dispatcher

=== opkg upgrade "fork failed" ===

http://trac.shr-project.org/trac/ticket/531

Beware that a failed opkg upgrade can result in a non-booting phone :-(

Workaround:

 opkg update
 cd /media/card
 dd if=/dev/zero of=swapfile.swp bs=1k count=128000
 mkswap swapfile.swp
 swapon swapfile.swp
 opkg upgrade
 swapoff swapfile.swp

Note that using your card for swap could potentially wear it out faster, though probably no need to worry just for the above workaround.
