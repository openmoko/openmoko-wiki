== Why SHR exists ==
'''SHR''' (Stable Hybrid Release) is a community driven distribution composed of the [[OpenmokoFramework|FSO]] and some basic applications, that can be configured to use several different graphical toolkits, for example GTK or EFL. SHR is based on the FSO build. At first, SHR was introduced in order to use the [[Openmoko2007.2]] GTK software in combination with the new [[OpenmokoFramework|FSO]], but things have changed.

==Feature overview==

In the overview below are all the essential features and their status for the current '''out of the box''' SHR unstable distribution (latest+[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_(Linux) modules]+updates). Green indicates that this part is functioning well, red indicates a known requirement which will be implemented later on and orange indicates functionality that can (and should) be fixed easily in the distribution for known fixes are available.

== Install ==

Installing SHR is very easy. It is stable enough for a daily use.

You should currently install the [http://build.shr-project.org/shr-unstable/images/om-gta02/?C=M;O=D unstable] build, but keep an eye on [http://blog.shr-project.org/ the shr blog] as the developers may occasionally "break" things in the name of progress ;-)

You can alternatively use the [http://build.shr-project.org/shr-testing/images/om-gta02/ testing] version, however as of writing this is very out of date.

A "stable" version will be available when the time is right.

The image links above are for GTA02 (Freerunner). See also [http://build.shr-project.org/shr-unstable/images/ other images]

I suppose that you know how to use [[NeoTool]], or are able to [[Flashing_the_Neo_FreeRunner|flash]] the following to your Neo :

- the [[Qi]] bootloader (optional, u-boot should work as well)

- the [http://build.shr-project.org/shr-testing/images/om-gta02/uImage-om-gta02-latest.bin kernel]

- the root filesystem : [http://build.shr-project.org/shr-testing/images/om-gta02/shr-lite-image-om-gta02.jffs2 flash image]

Alternatively, you may install it on uSD (for instance with Qi, by putting the kernel under /boot/uImage-GTA02.bin on first FAT16 partition and extracting contents of the [http://build.shr-project.org/shr-testing/images/om-gta02/shr-lite-image-om-gta02.tar.gz root filesystem tarball] on the second ext3 partition.

You can view the sources [http://git.shr-project.org/git/ here].

== Connecting your FreeRunner to your computer ==
For the next configuration steps, you will need to type some commands. It is much easier to type on a real keyboard than on a touch screen. 
So you need to connect your FR to you computer, and make a bridge to internet.
Use the [[USB Networking]] page for help about configuring your host computer.
NOTE: On first boot after flashing, USB networking can not work. If it's happening, simply reboot and try again.

When you have internet connection forwarded via USB (for example), before anything else you can refresh repositories by running:

 opkg update

== Setting local time ==
As any linux system, the UTC time is used by the system. First of all, adjust this time:
 date -u -s 010220052009
 Fri Jan  2 20:05:00 UTC 2009

Then, you need to "localise" your system. 
Search for the appropriate country with:
 opkg list | grep tzdata

then install the one corresponding to your area. 
 opkg install tzdata-europe

Then select your city (search the city available in /usr/share/zoneinfo/your-country, example Paris)
 ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Paris /etc/localtime

You can fully localise your system by installing the glibc-binary-localedata correponding to your langage. Search the ones available with:
 opkg list | grep glibc-binary-localedata

install with (example for France)
 opkg install glibc-binary-localedata-fr-fr

== Changing root password ==
SHR is shipped without root password (just press enter)

This is dangerous if you connect using USB. You need to activate the root password:

 passwd

and type your selected password (2 times)

== Customize the RingTone ==
You need to have a file containing the RingTone you want for your FR. You can find some at [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Ringtones#svn.openmoko.org_ringtones RingTone]

Then transfer it to your FR :
 scp file root@192.168.0.202:/usr/share/sounds/

Now you can select ringtone in SHR Settings.

== Sound Control ==

=== Mic and HP ===
The first idea is to use alsamixer; bad idea! There are 94 controls, and your modifications will be lost at the next reboot.Finding documentation is not easy. Here is my understanding: 
Scenari are used for each case. They are located in /usr/share/openmoko/scenarios/
- capturehandset.state  
- gsmheadset.state 
- headset.state         
- voip-handset.state
- gsmhandset.state
- gsmspeakerout.state
- stereoout.state

Each file is a set of value for the 94 parameters. I have identified some:

- Control 48: internal mic of the tel (set to 2 or 3)

- Control 4 : internal speaker (set from 110 to 120)

- Control 49: headset mic

- Control 3 : headset speaker



Generic info to the Neo soundsystem:

* [[Neo 1973 audio subsystem]]
* [[Neo alsamixer#Settings_Descriptions|Neo alsamixer - Settings Descriptions]]
* [[Neo Freerunner audio subsystem]]

== Known Issues ==
=== Phone ===

GSM network is lost after one day of uptime: restart your FR once a day!

=== Address Book ===

SHR is not implementing a PIM (Personal Information Manager) yet. Work is in progress, but to included in SHR testing this has some consequences on daily use:

* Only contacts on the SIM card are available.

* It is not possible to import a Vcard file.
** It seems to be possible with [gopher://gopher.fnordpol.de/9/data/DbusAccessScripts_0.0.0.tar.gz this] script written by [[User:Zem#DBus_Access_Scripts|Zem]].
