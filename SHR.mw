'''SHR''' (Stable Hybrid Release) is a community driven distribution based on the [[FSO]] framework. SHR can use several different graphical toolkits, for example GTK or EFL. At first, SHR was introduced in order to use the [[Om 2007.2]] GTK software in combination with the new FSO, but things have changed, now SHR comes with a full [[SHR User Manual]] in the OpenMoko-Wiki, that supports novice users in their first steps and SHR moves forward to a distribution for every day use.

SHR is based on linux kernel and [http://www.openembedded.org/ Openembedded]. <tt>XGlamo</tt> is providing X server environment and [[Illume]] (Enlightment window manager module for small devices) is providing comfortable finger controlled desktop environment. Under the hood of the pretty desktop there is [[FSO]] middleware talking to the GSM modem, GPS module as well as to the other bits of hardware. SHR <tt>ophonekitd</tt> daemon is run with X server start-up and it communicates with FSO via <tt>d-bus</tt>. SHR phone applications talk to <tt>ophonekitd</tt> and also to FSO so for example when you receive a phone call, the dialer is launched to provide a way of answering it. ''Dialer'', ''Contacts'' and ''Messages'' applications are part of the SHR internal <tt>libframeworkd-phonegui-efl</tt> library, ''Phonelog'' is an extra application written in python-gtk.

SHR wiki with more instructions, descriptions and informations is available on http://wiki.shr-project.org/
