'''SHR''' (Stable Hybrid Release) is a community driven distribution based on the [[FSO]] framework. SHR can use several different graphical toolkits, for example GTK or EFL. At first, SHR was introduced in order to use the [[Om 2007.2]] GTK software in combination with the new FSO, but things have changed, now SHR comes with a full [[SHR User Manual]] in the OpenMoko-Wiki, that supports novice users in their first steps and SHR moves forward to a distribution for every day use.

SHR wiki with more instructions, descriptions and informations is available on http://wiki.shr-project.org/

==Feature overview==
In the overview below are all the essential features and their status for the current '''out of the box''' SHR unstable distribution (latest+[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_(Linux) modules]+updates). Green indicates that this part is functioning well, red indicates a known requirement which will be implemented later on and orange indicates functionality that can (and should) be fixed easily in the distribution for known fixes are available.
