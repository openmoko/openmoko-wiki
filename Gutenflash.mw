'''GutenFlash''' lets you read books by displaying single words or small phrases quickly, in a large font.  The technique is known as RSVP, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_Serial_Visual_Presentation Rapid Serial Visual Presentation].  

Current features:
* loads plain text
* chapter navigation
* paragraph and sentence navigation
* continuous speed control from 20wpm - 2000wpm
* total / remaining playtime calculation
* 3 display modes

== Notes ==

=== UTF-8 === 
GutenFlash expects UTF-8 files. So for reading a file originally in iso-8859-1, please convert it before to UTF-8 in a shell terminal:
 iconv -f iso-8859-1 Reveries.txt -t utf-8 > Reveries.utf8

=== NameError: name 'init' is not defined===
You may want to update the pygtk __init__.py file as suggested in [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1718 #1718]

=== Preferences ===
Create your .gutenflash.conf file:
 
 gutenflash --showcfg > ~/.gutenflash.conf

and edit it.
