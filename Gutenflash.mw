=== UTF-8 ===
GutenFlash expects UTF-8 files. So for reading a file originally in iso-8859-1, please convert it before to UTF-8 in a shell terminal:
iconv -f iso-8859-1 Reveries.txt -t utf-8 > Reveries.utf8

=== NameError: name 'init' is not defined===
You may want to update the pygtk __init__.py file as suggested in [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1718 #1718]

=== Preferences ===
Create your .gutenflash.conf file:

gutenflash --showcfg > ~/.gutenflash.conf

and edit it.
