There is an image to provide a fresh Ubuntu 7.04 (feisty) containing the OpenMoko installation as generated by [[MokoMakefile]] including working [[OpenMoko under QEMU|QEMU]].


== Usage of the chroot image ==

If you do just want to test some of the functionality and need a starting point, 
you can download an ext3 Image. 

The Image is just a first test and may contain errors as it's not tested well yet
(and the build process was not running through without user interferences).


=== Installation ===

Get the Image (about 3.2 GB) from http://b030.tfh-berlin.de/OpenMoko-Dev-x86_2007-07-16.img.bz2:
 wget http://b030.tfh-berlin.de/OpenMoko-Dev-x86_2007-07-16.img.bz2


Check the md5sum:
 md5sum OpenMoko-Dev-x86_2007-07-16.img.bz2
 # it print "41715e06d7e59a94e4f05cf33ba054b5  OpenMoko-Dev-x86_2007-07-16.img.bz2"


You will need to decompress the Image (about 15 Gbyte). An you'll also need the chroot software
and loop back device support in your kernel.

 bzip2 -d OpenMoko-Dev-x86_2007-07-16.img.bz2

To install chroot in GNU/Debian / Ubuntu you can use:

 sudo sh
 apt-get install dchroot


==== To mount and activate the chroot image use ====

 mkdir /var/chroot
 mount -o loop OpenMoko-Dev-x86_2007-07-16.img /var/chroot

Add a new chroot configuration:

 echo "OpenMoko /var/chroot" | tee -a /etc/dchroot.conf

Edit /etc/fstab and insert ''skip this to mount manually'':
 /tmp            /var/chroot/tmp         none    bind            0       0 
 proc-chroot     /var/chroot/proc        proc    defaults        0       0 
 devpts-chroot   /var/chroot/dev/pts     devpts  defaults        0       0 
 mount -a

Manual mount:
 mount -o bind /tmp /var/chroot/tmp
 mount -t proc proc-chroot /var/chroot/proc
 mount -t devpts devpts-chroot /var/chroot/dev/pts

Copy your /etc/resolv.conf:
 cp /etc/resolv.conf /var/chroot/etc/

As the user who started X11:
 xhost +                   # assuming you are behind NAT

Start the chroot environment (as root again):
 dchroot -d -c OpenMoko    # -d to take the environment variables with you

=== Starting the Emulation ===

You can start the emulation by running:
 cd /home/moko/openmoko/trunk/src/host/qemu-neo1973/
 arm-softmmu/qemu-system-arm -M neo -m 130 -mtdblock openmoko/openmoko-flash.image \
 -kernel openmoko/openmoko-kernel.bin -usb -show-cursor -usbdevice keyboard

=== Additional Notes ===

There is no root password set and no user moko in the systems right now which should 
not be a problem when used in an emulator or a chroot environment, here you have both.
