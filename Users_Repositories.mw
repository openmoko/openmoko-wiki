::ScaredyCat also has a ipkg repository for 2007.2 where e.g. gpe-filemanager and a lot more (e.g. ntpd) can be installed from. On the Neo do:

 cd /etc/ipkg
 wget http://buildhost.automated.it/OM2007.2/packages/scaredycat.conf 
 ipkg update
 ipkg install gpe-filemanager
 ipkg install gpe-timesheet
 ipkg install gpe-todo
 ipkg install mysql
 ipkg install mtpaint
 ipkg install sqlite
 ipkg install ntp
 #(you get the idea)
 /etc/init.d/xserver-nodm restart    # to make the new applications appear in the menu

If you want to add a link, it would be nice to enforce a standard format of these feeds so that they can be browsed automatically.
