For information about the official downloads and distributions, see [[Download]]. A [[Community Repository]] hosted by Openmoko Inc. was setup in August 2008.

{{Warning|Never add feeds which are not for your installed distribution. Mixing feeds will [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/support/2008-August/002227.html break your system].}}

ScaredyCat also has a opkg repository for 2007.2 where e.g. gpe-filemanager and a lot more (e.g. ntpd) can be installed from. On the Neo do:

 cd /etc/opkg
 wget http://buildhost.automated.it/scaredycat.conf 
 opkg update
 opkg install gpe-filemanager
 opkg install gpe-timesheet
 opkg install gpe-todo
 opkg install mysql
 opkg install mtpaint
 opkg install sqlite
 opkg install ntp
 #(you get the idea)
 /etc/init.d/xserver-nodm restart    # to make the new applications appear in the menu

==='''MokSec'''===

Here you will find the project which are related to the MokSec (OpenMoko Security) project. The packages works under FSO, but have to work also on other distribution.

:http://opkg.networld.to/moksec/testing
:http://opkg.networld.to/networld-ported

To add the repository to your Neo use the following command:

<pre>
echo "src/gz moksec-testing http://opkg.networld.to/moksec/testing" > /etc/opkg/moksec-testing.conf
echo "src/gz networld-ported http://opkg.networld.to/networld-ported" > /etc/opkg/networld-ported.conf
</pre>

networld-ported includes the following packages (maybe not complete list):

* aircrack-ng
* cryptcat
* ettercap-ng
* memdump
* silc-toolkit
* sslstrip
* zenmap/nmap
* nginx

===FSO===

The official feeds can be found at  http://downloads.freesmartphone.org/ and here http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/nslu2/feeds/freesmartphone/ (mirror). The hosting is with thanks to our friends at [http://NSLU2-Linux.org NSLU2-Linux] and [http://OSUOSL.org Open Source Labs].

=== Jec ===

Jec hosts automatic IPKG builds for Openmoko on a dedicated server (P4 3.2 GHz) connected directly to Internet. Interested maintainers can contact  Jean-Eric Cuendet  <  ml.jecuendet at gmail.com > for an account. Packages are at :   http://alf.pticoli.net/openmoko/ . Created 9/9/2008, so I would not add it as a feed but ''opkg install URL''.
