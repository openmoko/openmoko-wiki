For information about the official downloads and distributions, see [[Download]]. A [[Community Repository]] hosted by Openmoko Inc. was setup in August 2008.

{{Warning|Never add feeds which are not for your installed distribution. Mixing feeds will [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/support/2008-August/002227.html break your system].}}

=== Angstrom Repository ===
{{Main|[[:category:Angstrom]]}}
Angstrom is the base distribution of Openmoko Linux distribution. It contains the basic set of Linux applications and they should be compatible with Openmoko. [http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/repo/ The repository package listing].

To add the unstable Angstrom feed, update your ''/etc/opkg/base-feeds.conf'' to include a line:

<pre>
src/gz base http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/feeds/2007/ipk/glibc/armv4t/base
</pre>

On Om 2008.8, run the following commands from the Neo:

<pre>
echo "arch base 50" > /etc/opkg/angstrom-feed.conf
echo "src/gz base http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/feeds/2008/ipk/glibc/armv4t/base" >> /etc/opkg/angstrom-feed.conf
</pre>

This repository contains the following useful packages:

* [[Pidgin]] - Instant Messaging.  Can connect to MSN, Google Talk, Yahoo, ICQ with additional plugins
* [[Minimo]] - Web Browsing.  AJAX capable, based on the Gecko rendering engine
* [[Navit]] - Car Navigation with Routing Engine

=== Jalimo ===
{{Main|Jalimo}}
[https://wiki.evolvis.org/jalimo/index.php/Main_Page Jalimo] is a project to maintain a full featured free Java-like stack for mobile Linux-based devices. The aim is to pack and tailor existing JVM-related projects, as well as to develop APIs and tools for easy integration and development for the target platforms.

OpenMoko provides most of Jalimo's packages through their own repository, but some packages have not been merged yet and are available through Jalimo's repositories. Run the following two commands to add them:

<pre>
echo "src/gz jalimo http://jalimo.evolvis.org/repository/openmoko/all" > /etc/opkg/jalimo-feed-all.conf
echo "src/gz jalimo-armv4t http://jalimo.evolvis.org/repository/openmoko/armv4t" > /etc/opkg/jalimo-feed-armv4t.conf
</pre>

'''unsatisfied libgcc-s1 dependency''': Currently you will get an error when installing OpenMoko packages from our repository since Jalimo is using OpenEmbedded's .dev branch to built the packages but OpenMoko is not. A workaround is to add ''-force-depends'' to the ''opkg'' command until we figured this out: ''opkg install -force-depends classpath''

ScaredyCat also has a opkg repository for 2007.2 where e.g. gpe-filemanager and a lot more (e.g. ntpd) can be installed from. On the Neo do:

 cd /etc/opkg
 wget http://buildhost.automated.it/scaredycat.conf 
 opkg update
 opkg install gpe-filemanager
 opkg install gpe-timesheet
 opkg install gpe-todo
 opkg install mysql
 opkg install mtpaint
 opkg install sqlite
 opkg install ntp
 #(you get the idea)
 /etc/init.d/xserver-nodm restart    # to make the new applications appear in the menu

==='''MokSec'''===

Here you will find the project which are related to the MokSec (OpenMoko Security) project. The packages works under FSO, but have to work also on other distribution.

:http://opkg.networld.to/moksec/testing

To add the repository to your Neo use the following command:

<pre>
echo "src/gz moksec-testing http://opkg.networld.to/moksec/testing" > /etc/opkg/moksec-testing.conf
</pre>

===celtune===
:http://rabenfrost.net/celtune/?C=M;O=D
:http://rabenfrost.net/celtune/ipk/

Celtune offers Standard-Builds (.jffs2, .tar.gz, .bin, .ipk) and several special-images with additional packages (e.g. monster-images,navigation-images,...) 

For more info take a look at http://rabenfrost.net/celtune/1-NEWS-WARNING-INFO 

You can find images, kernels and packages for other devices too on http://rabenfrost.net/celtune/ (e.g. HTC-Blueangel, Asus730W ...)

A huge number of packages is located at http://rabenfrost.net/celtune/ipk/  

Use the following line to add celtune's feed to your neo: 
 cd /etc/opkg && wget http://rabenfrost.net/celtune/celtune-rabenfrost.conf



===FSO===

The official feeds can be found at  http://downloads.freesmartphone.org/ . The hosting is with thanks to our friends at [http://NSLU2-Linux.org NSLU2-Linux] and [http://OSUOSL.org Open Source Labs].

=== Jec ===

Jec hosts automatic IPKG builds for Openmoko on a dedicated server (P4 3.2 GHz) connected directly to Internet. Interested maintainers can contact  Jean-Eric Cuendet  <  ml.jecuendet at gmail.com > for an account. Packages are at :   http://alf.pticoli.net/openmoko/ . Created 9/9/2008, so I would not add it as a feed but ''opkg install URL''.

=== Gecco ===

Repository for [[Gtkaddpoi]], [[Gpsdcontrol]], [[TwitterMoko]], [[OpenVibe]], {{opkg.org|149|I'm Rich}} and [[Yaouh!]].
 cd /etc/opkg
 wget http://minucci.net/file/gecco-feed.conf

===Note===
If you want to add a link, it would be nice to enforce a standard format of these feeds so that they can be browsed automatically.
