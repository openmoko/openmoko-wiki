== Overview ==
''Geocaching is an outdoor treasure-hunting game in which the participants use a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver or other navigational techniques to hide and seek containers (called "geocaches" or "caches") anywhere in the world. A typical cache is a small waterproof container containing a logbook and "treasure," usually toys or trinkets of little value.''[http://www.wikipedia.org]

An application for geocaching guides you to a cache with direction and distance, of course. But it should also be possible to download additional information like description, logs and hints for a cache.

== Use Cases ==
* Download caches nearby current position
* Download additional information of a cache
* Alert me, if I'm (unintentional) nearby a cache
* Log caches offline
* Distance and direction to a cache
* Support for [http://wherigo.com Wherigo] cartridges (However, it seems that the file format isn't open.)

=== Spider ===
Since www.geocaching.com doesn't have a documented API, a spider has to retrieve indormation from the website. Maybe the spider of [http://www.cachewolf.de CacheWolf] might be a good starting point. However, it is written in Java.

I just noticed that it isn't allowed to automatic download content from www.geocaching.com:
[http://www.geocaching.com/about/termsofuse.aspx Terms of use agreement] (Section 5)

=== DBUS ===
I don't know much about [[D-Bus]]. It would be nice to have a D-Bus interface so send the details (e.g. coordinates) to other applications. This way,
* [[TangoGPS]] could display the cache on a map,
* [[Navit]] could route to a cache,
* a compass application could point to the cache,
* a location based ToDo list could make an alert.

So the Geocaching application don't have to provide all these functionalities.

* [http://geotoad.googlecode.com GeoToad]: Ruby implementation for paperless caching. Not maintained.
* [http://geo.rkkda.com/ Rick Richardson's Linux tools for geocaching]: Various tools for geocaching. Some are designed to turn the clickly-clicky-scroll-clicky-clicky messes that are geocaching.com and navicache.com into a set of tools which you can use in a batch or cron mode to establish your normal caching routine, backup your caches and cache logs, etc. Others are used to enter new waypoints, a free geocoder, create custom maps of waypoints, etc
