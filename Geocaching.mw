== Overview ==
Geocaching is an outdoor treasure-hunting game in which the participants use a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver or other navigational techniques to hide and seek containers (called "geocaches" or "caches") anywhere in the world. A typical cache is a small waterproof container containing a logbook and "treasure," usually toys or trinkets of little value. (from http://www.wikipedia.org)

An application for geocaching guides you to a cache with direction and distance, of course. But it should also be possible to download additional information like description, logs and hints for a cache.

== Use Cases ==
* Distance and direction to a cache
* Additional information of the cache
* Alert me, if I'm (unintentional) nearby a cache
* Support for [http://wherigo.com Wherigo] cartridges (However, it seems that the file format isn't open.)
