== Overview ==
Geocaching is an outdoor treasure-hunting game in which the participants use a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver or other navigational techniques to hide and seek containers (called "geocaches" or "caches") anywhere in the world. A typical cache is a small waterproof container containing a logbook and "treasure," usually toys or trinkets of little value. (from http://www.wikipedia.org)

An application for geocaching guides you to a cache with direction and distance, of course. But it should also be possible to download additional information like description, logs and hints for a cache.

== Use Cases ==
* Distance and direction to a cache
* Additional information of the cache
* Alert me, if I'm (unintentional) nearby a cache
* Support for [http://wherigo.com Wherigo] cartridges (However, it seems that the file format isn't open.)

* [http://www.cachewolf.de CacheWolf]: Java software for paperless Caching. It uses a spider to retrieve the information from [http://www.geocaching.com www.geocaching.com]. Only in German.
* [http://geotoad.sourceforge.net GeoToad]: Ruby implementation for paperless caching. Not maintained.
* [http://geo.rkkda.com/ Rick Richardson's Linux tools for geocaching]: Various tools for geocaching. Some are designed to turn the clickly-clicky-scroll-clicky-clicky messes that are geocaching.com and navicache.com into a set of tools which you can use in a batch or cron mode to establish your normal caching routine, backup your caches and cache logs, etc. Others are used to enter new waypoints, a free geocoder, create custom maps of waypoints, etc
