= Openmoko Beagle Hybrid=
This project provides a PCB extension board and software to combine a [http://beagleboard.org Beagle Board] with a Freerunner compatible display and case.

When using the case, one can provide sound (earset, speaker) and vibracall.

= What it is good for =
* experimenting with touchscreen and new user interfaces on Beagleboard
* learn OMAP3530 design
* adding a battery pack and a UMTS usb stick makes it a mobile application development platform
* investigating how a Openmoko with UMTS and OMAP3530 feels
* porting [[SHR]], [[QtMoko]], [[Android]], etc.
