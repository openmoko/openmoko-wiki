= Openmoko Beagle Hybrid=
This project provides a PCB extension board and software to combine a [http://beagleboard.org Beagle Board] with a Freerunner compatible display and case.

The goal is to provide a demonstrator and experimentation platform how a future modern state-of the art Openmoko device with ARM-Cortex A8 and UMTS could be (neglecting miniaturization). This allows to develop software and new user interfaces. When packing the board into a Freerunner case, one can provide sound (microphone, earset, speaker) and vibracall.

= What it is good for =
* experimenting with touchscreen and new user interfaces on Beagleboard
* learn how the OMAP3530 design works
* make it a mobile application development platform by adding a battery pack and a UMTS usb stick 
* investigate how an Openmoko with UMTS and OMAP3530 feels (not from haptics but screen operation and UMTS speed)
* porting [[SHR]], [[QtMoko]], [[Android]], etc. to ARM-Cortex A8, NEON

= Pictures =
Here some pictures of our prototypes (the final PCB will be rotated by 180 degrees to allow to access the SD slot).

= Features =
* PCB that fits into Freerunner case (top cover and middle part after cutting a hole)
* works also outside of a case
* Toppoly LCM interface (same display as used in the Freerunner - otherwise it would not fit into the case)
* TSC2007 touch screen controller
* Microphone
* Earset and Speaker connector (for Freerunner case)
* 2 buttons (AUX and Power)
* 2 dual color LEDs (in the AUX and Power buttons)
* vibracall driver
* headset jack to connect microphone, earset and speaker

= Availability =
Assuming that we don't get unexpected problems (e.g. vulcano-delay) with important components, availability is scheduled for End of May 2010.
