This project provides a PCB extension board and software to combine a [http://beagleboard.org Beagle Board] with a Freerunner compatible display and case.

The goal is to provide a demonstrator and experimentation platform how a future modern state-of the art Openmoko device with ARM-Cortex A8 and UMTS could be (neglecting miniaturization). This allows to develop software and new user interfaces. When packing the board into a Freerunner case, one can provide sound (microphone, earset, speaker) and vibracall.

== What it is good for ==
* experimenting with touchscreen and new user interfaces on Beagleboard
* learn how the OMAP3530 design works
* make it a mobile application development platform by adding a battery pack and a UMTS usb stick 
* investigate how an Openmoko with UMTS and OMAP3530 feels (not from haptics but screen operation and UMTS speed)
* porting [[SHR]], [[QtMoko]], [[Android]], etc. to ARM-Cortex A8, NEON

== Pictures ==
Here some pictures of our prototypes (the final PCB will be rotated by 180 degrees to allow to access the SD slot).

== Features ==
* PCB that fits into Freerunner case (top cover and middle part after cutting a hole)
* works also outside of a case
* Toppoly LCM interface (same display as used in the Freerunner - otherwise it would not fit into the case)
* TSC2007 touch screen controller
* Microphone
* Earset and Speaker connector (for Freerunner case)
* 2 buttons (AUX and Power)
* 2 dual color LEDs (in the AUX and Power buttons)
* vibracall driver
* headset jack to connect microphone, earset and speaker
* W2SG004 (Sirf-III) GPS
* ITG3200 3-axis gyroscope

== Software and Downloads ==
=== Sources ===
* U-Boot GIT: http://projects.goldelico.com/p/gta04-uboot/
* Kernel: http://projects.goldelico.com/p/gta04-kernel/
* Debian Lenny rootfs: http://projects.goldelico.com/p/gta04-rootfs/

=== User space file systems ===
Initial tests have shown that it is quite easy to port/configure Freerunner GUI distributions to run on this hardware/kernel. Therefore we encourage to port

* Android: e.g. rowboat
* Angstrom
* QtMoko
* SHR
* etc.

=== Binaries ===
locate binaries for MLO (first phase boot loader), U-Boot, boot scripts and splash screens, Kernel, Angstrom or Lenny Demo Image, patches (config.tgz) and modules (modules.tgz) from
http://download.goldelico.com/ombeagle/trunk

Please note that you have to copy them in a specially formatted SD card. Look into the makesd script for an example (WARNING: adapt to your system or you may destroy your hard disk).

== Availability ==
After some delay with our SMD production, availability is scheduled for 15th August 2010.

The board can be ordered through: http://www.handheld-linux.com/wiki.php?page=Openmoko%20Beagle
