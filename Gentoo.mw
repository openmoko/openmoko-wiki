{{Languages|Gentoo}}

Gentoo project on Openmoko phones has its own homepage: [http://gentoo.mindzoo.de/ http://gentoo.mindzoo.de/]

We have our own portage overlay and some Openmoko packages like Xglamo, Illume or Zhone already have theyr ebuilds.

== Ways to work with Gentoo ==
Currently, there are 2 ways how to install gentoo, both having advantages and disadvantages:

* Cross compile approach, where you use another machine to compile your whole phone system.

* Native compilation approach, where you work with Gentoo on phone as with a normal system fully capable of installing its own packages.


Many thanks go to 'torindel' who apparently started the effort and made a stage tarball we are using even today for the native approach.

== How to get started ==
If you want to try out a normal Gentoo experience, as seen on desktop, feel free to follow these [http://gentoo.mindzoo.de/index.cgi/wiki/native-compiling native installation instructions].

Please note, unless you use distcc, it takes a long time to get a fully working system this way (About 3 days for xorg with fluxbox).
