= Gentoo on Openmoko phones =

Gentoo project on Openmoko phones has its own homepage: [http://gentoo.mindzoo.de/ http://gentoo.mindzoo.de/]

We have a portage overlay and some Openmoko packages like Xglamo, Illume or Zhone already have their ebuilds and many more will follow !

== Ways to work with Gentoo ==
Currently, there are 3 ways to install Gentoo, each having their own advantages and disadvantages:

* [http://gentoo.mindzoo.de/index.cgi/wiki/cross-compiling Cross compile approach], where you use another machine to compile your whole phone system. (Requires a Gentoo machine)

* [http://gentoo.mindzoo.de/index.cgi/wiki/native-compiling Native compilation approach], where you work with Gentoo on phone as with a normal system fully capable of installing its own packages.

* [http://gentoo.mindzoo.de/index.cgi/wiki/qemu-user qemu-user emulated native compilation], where you use another machine 'chroot' into a gentoo filesystem (created by either of the methods above) and execute ARM binaries as if they were native executables.

{{Note|
Many thanks go to 'torindel' who apparently started the effort and made a stage tarball we are using even today for the native approach and to Tuxxx who contributed strongly to the cross compilation efforts on gentoo for openmoko phones.
