{{Languages|Gentoo}}

Gentoo project on Openmoko phones has its own homepage: [http://gentoo.mindzoo.de/ http://gentoo.mindzoo.de/]

We have a portage overlay and some Openmoko packages like Xglamo, Illume or Zhone already have their ebuilds and many more will follow !

== Ways to work with Gentoo ==
Currently, there are 2 ways how to install gentoo, both having advantages and disadvantages:

* [http://gentoo.mindzoo.de/index.cgi/wiki/cross-compiling Cross compile approach], where you use another machine to compile your whole phone system.

* [http://gentoo.mindzoo.de/index.cgi/wiki/native-compiling Native compilation approach], where you work with Gentoo on phone as with a normal system fully capable of installing its own packages.


Many thanks go to 'torindel' who apparently started the effort and made a stage tarball we are using even today for the native approach.

== Getting Started ==
* Read instructions on our [http://gentoo.mindzoo.de/ homepage]
* Visit our overlay page [http://overlays.gentoo.org/proj/embedded overlay page]
* Come chat with us to Freenode on #gentoo-openmoko and share your problems !
