{{Languages| Development Environment}}
If you want to create a new application, you might want to look at [[Toolchain]] first.  However, if the dependency is complex or you want to modify something already in system, currently the easiest way to go is still using [[OpenEmbedded]].

= New Application =
* [[Toolchain]]
* [[OpenmokoFramework]]
* Anjuta plugin[http://free-opensource.qvantel.net/mediawiki/index.php/Preity-plugin]
* [[Host-based development with Xoo and Xephyr]]

= Develop with OE =
After setting up the OE (OpenEmbedded) environment, making it build the latest component of Openmoko is necessary to avoid duplicated work.  Refer to [[Openmoko2007.2#How_to_enable_autorev|How to enable autorev]] to find out how to do this.  The first build will take a lot of time and occupy a good deal of disk space, but after that it will be faster.  You will also need to '''remove''' the
INHERIT += "rm_work
line in your local.conf if it exists.

Now, for example, if you want to modify openmoko-sample2, you can do this to build it first:
bitbake openmoko-sample2
After that:
bitbake openmoko-sample2 -c devshell
You will be dropped to a shell that the environment is set to build the package.  After the modification, usually a simple `make' will do the trick.  You should be able to find the new binary under a hidden .libs directory if this package uses autotools.

== Use quilt ==
We could make modification and manage it by `quilt'.

$ # no need to mkdir patches.  already exists.
$ quilt new foo.patch
$ quilt add to_be_changed.c
$ vi to_be_changed.c
''<coding monkey is working...>''
$ make
$ scp foobar neo:   # copy it to neo
''<test... wow it works>''
$ quilt refresh
$ cp -r patches ~/miracle  # keep it somewhere

== Tips ==
* You might find it convenient to replace the source directory with a symlink to the same directory under your Openmoko svn tree, once you get more understanding of OE.  You need to patch and configure the source again if you go this route.

* If you don't want to use devshell, change directory to ${WORKDIR} directly (usually one level higher than the directory that devshell drops you to), do the modification, and invoke ./temp/run.do_compile.xxxx will also compile the source again.

== Make ipkg for distributing ==
Multiple ways to do this:
* Use quilt patches and add it to the bb file.  Rebuild.
* bitbake openmoko-sample2 -c package_write
