==Pimlico==

From the website: ''Pimlico is a suite of lightweight Personal Information Management (PIM) 
applications designed primarily for handheld and mobile devices''

* Dates - calendar
* Contacts - address book
* Tasks - task list
* Sync - synchronization

This project uses the evolution-data-server.

Project Website: [http://www.pimlico-project.org/ pimlico]

Successfully imported a full address book vcf file created by saving an Evolution address book.  Have not yet tried importing (or sharing) a calendar.  Dates seems to support online web calendars.

According to the project website, Sync is not quite ready for release (other than svn).

===OM2008===

Dates and Tasks are in opkg:

<pre>
opkg install openmoko-dates2 openmoko-tasks2
</pre>

See the project website for screen shots.

(In OM2008.x Contacts uses other package from qtopia.)

NB: This packages do not correspond to the last version of pimlico ?

===Debian===

Dates and Contacts can be compiled relatively easily from source by installing 
the necessary development packages.  (''Packaging underway'').

===SHR===
==== SHR testing (2009-03) ====
There is currently no package in the SHR repositories. You can add the [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Users_Repositories#Angstrom_Repository Angstrom repository] :

 echo "arch base 50" > /etc/opkg/angstrom-feed.conf
 echo "src/gz base http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/feeds/2008/ipk/glibc/armv4t/base" >> /etc/opkg/angstrom-feed.conf
 opkg update
 opkg install dates tasks

If you don't want to break your shr install with the next opkg upgrade, you must remove the angtrom feed after installing dates and tasks
 rm /etc/opkg/angstrom-feed.conf
 opkg update

==== SHR unstable (2009-04-10) ====
Since this date, "dates" and "tasks" from Pimlico are in the SHR unstable repository. So if you run SHR unstable, just do
 opkg update
 opkg install dates tasks
to install them.
