==Pimlico==

From the website: ''Pimlico is a suite of lightweight Personal Information Management (PIM) 
applications designed primarily for handheld and mobile devices''

* Dates - calendar
* Contacts - address book
* Tasks - task list
* Sync - synchronization

This project uses the evolution-data-server.

Project Website: [http://www.pimlico-project.org/ pimlico]

Successfully imported a full address book vcf file created by saving and Evolution address book.  Have not yet tried importing (or sharing) a calendar.  Dates seems to support online web calendars.

According to the project website, Sync is not quite ready for release (other than svn).

===OM2008===

Dates and Tasks are in opkg:

<pre>
opkg install openmoko-dates2 openmoko-tasks2
</pre>

See the project website for screen shots.

(In OM2008.x Contacts uses other package from qtopia.)

NB: This packages do not correspond to the last version of pimlico ?

===Debian===

Dates and Contacts can be compiled relatively easily from source by installing 
the necessary development packages.  (''Packaging underway'').
