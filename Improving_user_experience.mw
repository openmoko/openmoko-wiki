=Overview=

Like Wolfgang said in http://n2.nabble.com/Weekly-Engineering-News-41-2008-td1336450.html , Openmoko assembled a team to focus on improving the user experience.  The focus and coverage of this group is:

* We improve the current stack instead of creating new features.
* Prefer stuffs which could be brought over to gta03 instead of gta02/om2008 specific.
* Won't work on om2007 stack.  Won't do hardware.
* May cooperate with Paroli, FSO or system team but we're not them.
* Will work on Qtopia but with lower priority.

=ToDO=

Here is the current ''draft'' and it will be updated frequently.

* call quality +1
** echo (in testing [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1267 #1267])
