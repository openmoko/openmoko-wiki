Like Wolfgang said in http://n2.nabble.com/Weekly-Engineering-News-41-2008-td1336450.html , Openmoko assembled a team to focus on improving the user experience.  Here
is our todo list, feel free to put your vote and add main issues that you think is critical.

as a proposal:

'''Priority:''' measured from 1 (highest) ... 5 (nice to have); put your priority into the comma separated list and we calculate later the average;

'''Votes:''' just edit and add +1 if you wote YES|NO in the corresponding column;


{| border=1 cellspacing=0
