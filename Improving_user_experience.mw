=Overview=

Like Wolfgang said in http://n2.nabble.com/Weekly-Engineering-News-41-2008-td1336450.html , Openmoko assembled a team to focus on improving the user experience.  The focus and coverage of this group is:

* We improve the current stack instead of creating new features.
* Prefer stuffs which could be brought over to gta03 instead of gta02/om2008 specific.
* Won't work on om2007 stack.  Won't do hardware.
* May cooperate with Paroli, FSO or system team but we're not them.
* Will work on Qtopia but with lower priority.

=ToDO=

Here is the current ''draft'' and it will be updated frequently.

* call quality +1
** echo (in testing [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1267 #1267])
** volume (alsa-state?)
* Reduce boot time ([http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/69 #69],[http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1722 #1722])
* Optimize the touch screen driver on freerunner for finger usage.(in testing [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/2031 #2031])
* A generic python loader to enhance the start up time of python scripts.
* qtopia
** bugfix
** program startup speed
** response time
* network
** scripts: resolv.conf, etc.

==Evaluating==

* Reliably make and receive phone calls and SMS messages
* suspend/resume
** resume reliably ([http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1884 #1884],[http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1991 #1991])
** take a screenshot before suspend.  display it on screen first thing on resume.
** do not suspend when usb connected, qtopia indexing, etc.
* qtopia
** change the button order of "end call" or "ans call"
** put speaker button on the dialer app
* peripherals

***illume: disable suspend by power button when screen blanked
