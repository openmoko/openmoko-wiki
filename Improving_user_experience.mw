Like Wolfgang said in http://n2.nabble.com/Weekly-Engineering-News-41-2008-td1336450.html , Openmoko assembled a team to focus on improving the user experience.  Here
is our todo list at the moment:

* Reduce boot time.

* Optimize the touch screen driver on freerunner for finger usage.

* A generic python loader to enhance the start up time of python scripts.

* Work with system team to improve suspend/resume user experience.

* We improve the current stack, not creating new features.

* Prefer stuffs which could be brought over to gta03 instead of gta02/om2008 specific.

* won't work on om2007 stack.

* working on improving the Xglamo
