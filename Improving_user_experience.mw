Like Wolfgang said in http://n2.nabble.com/Weekly-Engineering-News-41-2008-td1336450.html , Openmoko assembled a team to focus on improving the user experience.  Here
is our todo list at the moment:

* Reduce boot time.

* Optimize the touch screen driver on freerunner for finger usage.

* A generic python loader to enhance the start up time of python scripts.

* Work with system team to improve suspend/resume user experience.

* We improve the current stack, not creating new features.

* Prefer stuffs which could be brought over to gta03 instead of gta02/om2008 specific.

* won't work on om2007 stack.

* working on improving the Xglamo

* afair 3d and video (ie playing videos) still need work.

*Program response should be lots better. Startup time reducing for apps would be great.

* Suspend is quite good at the moment, but when the display is 'blanked' and the system is not in suspend, maybe pressing the 'power' button could wake up the screen instead. Now it wakes up and immediately suspends.

* my suspend / resum still kills my sound.

* The "suspend on power button" is completely useless for me.

- Emacs phone services on top of dbus
- touch and accellerometer based gui for nearly blind people
- funky gui that changes every week for teenagers(Ok, I dont really want to develop this but i'd like to have it)

Here are some ideas of mine:
- get emacs23 working, so one can use the dbus support of emacs 23.
- make a dialer compatible with bbdb, and later addressbook.el
- make a gnus backend for sms
- a symbol chooser keyboard, much like you hinted at below.
Heres my take on the idea:
- start the "keyboard"(an emacs app) in a particular context(lets say
m-x now, but its the same for adresses or whatever)
- (1) show all unique prefixes in this context
- (2) choose a prefix
- (3) repeat from (1) with the chosen prefix, exit on a terminal symbol

* Stability
* Stability should be the top priority.  Getting suspend/resume, GSM issues and fixing CPU hogging processes fixed, would be a great help in allowing me (and I am sure many other  people) to focus limited amounts of free time to actually developing software and customizing the distribution, instead of trying to chase bugs and scouring for tweaks/fixes, just to get the basic features working.

* phone/sms functinality should fixed and maybe enhanced and afterwards the PC functions could be performed
