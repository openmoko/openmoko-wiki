== Open registry for community / homebrew USB Product IDs ==

'''Do not apply before your project is published under a FOSS license!'''

As the openmoko products have been discontinued, Openmoko Inc. is opening up the use of its Vendor ID for use by the Free and Open Source software and hardware communities.  This means you can simply register your devices and will get an allocation of a Product ID for free.

'''Do not apply before your project is published under a FOSS license!'''

=== Conditions ===

'''Do not apply before your project is published under a FOSS license!'''

By applying for an Openmoko Product ID, you acknowledge that either
* the USB device you are developing is either an open hardware project (as per [http://www.oshwa.org/definition/ the OSHW Definition]), '''or'''
* the firmware/software running on your USB device is Free / Open Source software, licensed under an OSI-Approved, FSF-Recognized or DFSG-Approved Free / Open Source software license

'''Do not apply before your project is published under a FOSS license!'''

In order to request a product ID, please send an e-mail to [mailto:usb-id@openmoko.org usb-id@openmoko.org] including
* '''the string "request" somewhere in the subject'''
* a name and short description of your usb device project
* the license under which you are releasing the hardware and/or software/firmware of the device
* a link to the project website and/or source code repository, if any
* a '''terse descriptive string''' for each ID you want, according to the examples below (field#3 in table). This string will show up in tools like `lsusb` etc and should avoid to use "USB" to describe what the device is/does, since those tools are implicitly about USB already. (bad: "USB keyboard", less bad: "Joe's USB-RS232 adapter" (established term in one word), BEST: "ACME1 secure mass storage device, type 512")
* if you (might) need multiple Product IDs, please indicate + explain this at the first message, rather than applying for a second ID later
* '''If you later decide to apply for a PID elsewhere, you must send us a cancellation mail to avoid collisions, duplicating and other issues'''. We normally respond to requests within 2 weeks, sometimes it can take up to a month.

Feel free to also contact us on IRC, #openmoko channel on Freenode.

== Assigned/Allocated Openmoko USB Product IDs ==
Openmoko is using the USB Vendor and Product IDs below.  Note that '''0x1457''' is the Vendor ID of '''FIC, Inc''', and '''0x1d50''' is the vendor ID of '''Openmoko, Inc.'''

The current list of allocations can be found at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openmoko/openmoko-usb-oui/master/usb_product_ids.psv

The above mentioned IDs have been submitted for inclusion into the http://www.linux-usb.org/usb.ids list.

The strings "reserved"|"Reserved"|"*R!*" tag records not to get included in any updates sent upstream. They '''must not''' show up in any other record.

The sequences "/*" and "//" denote start of comment (until EOL) in 3rd field which will not get included to the usb.ids file, any patch should filter out those comments

Groups of IDs (>=1) for one entity or project should get assigned starting at 0x???(0|4|8|c) and allow for a sufficient number (3, for prospective larger projects 7 or 15) of consecutive available free IDs for the previous project to grow.
