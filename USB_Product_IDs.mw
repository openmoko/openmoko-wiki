== Open registry for community / homebrew USB Product IDs ==

As the openmoko products have been discontinued, Openmoko Inc. is opening up the use of its Vendor ID for use by the Free and Open Source software and hardware communities.  This means you can simply register your devices and will get an allocation of a Product ID for free.

=== Conditions ===

By applying for an Openmoko Product ID, you acknowledge that either
* the USB device you are developing is either an open hardware project with at least publicly available schematics, or
* the firmware/software running on your USB device is Free / Open Source software, licensed under an OSI-Approved, FSF-Recognized or DFSG-Approved Free / Open Source software license

In order to request a product ID, please send an e-mail to [mailto:usb-id@openmoko.org usb-id@openmoko.org] including
* a name and short description of your usb device project
* a link to the project website and/or source code repository, if any
