{{Languages | Gsmd}}
[[gsmd]] is the [[GSM]] daemon running in background of an Openmoko phone, managing the traditional 'phone' parts (voice/sms/gprs communication links) of the phone.

Further technical details and API documentation in progress, is available [[Gsmd/document |here]].

== Usage ==

=== On the phone ===
gsmd is usually started as a background daemon when booting by the /etc/init.d/gsmd script, in this case gsmd outputs debug messages to the file "/tmp/gsm.log" (stdout and stderr is redirected there).

For debugging purposes gsmd can be run in foreground mode, options can be queried like:
<pre>

This program is FREE SOFTWARE under the terms of GNU GPL

Usage:
        -v      --version       Display program version
        -d      --daemon        Deamonize
        -h      --help          Display this help message
        -p dev  --device dev    Specify serial device to be used
        -s spd  --speed spd     Specify speed in bps (9600,38400,115200,...)
        -F      --hwflow        Hardware Flow Control (RTS/CTS)
        -L      --leak-report   Leak Report of talloc memory allocator
        -l file --logfile file  Specify a logfile to log to
</pre>

If your GSM modem is attached to ttySAC0 (like in the [[:Category:Neo1973 Hardware | Neo1973]]), invoke it as e.g.:
 > gsmd -p /dev/ttySAC0 -s 115200 -F
(baud rate seems to be autodetected by the modem)

=== From host PC===
With recent [[uboot]] (svn > r2885), the gsm modem can be powered on and connected to uboot's serial console from uboot itself. Thus allowing the host PC to interact directly with the modem. Some notes about getting gsmd running in this manner is [[User:Miki/hosted_gsmd|here]].

== libgsmd ==

libgsmd is a library with C language API for application programs.  Programs using this library can use the phone, e.g. make phone calls, receive incoming calls, register to the network, etc.

== libgsmd-tool ==

libgsmd-tool is a small demo application that can be used to demonstrate the usage of the libgsmd API.

== Usage ==

libgsmd-tool has multiple modes.  

=== Usage of shell mode ===

Shell mode provides a simple text-based command interface for making voice calls.

The shell mode can be started using

 libgsmd-tool -m shell

It can be used like in the following example:

=== Usage of atcmd mode ===

The atcmd mode is a passthrough-mode.  Passthrough means that it accepts [[GSM 07.07]] commands, passes them through the daemon to the phone, and returns you the response.  this is very useful for debugging.

The atcmd mode can be started using

 libgsmd-tool -m atcmd

Usage is like in the following example:

<pre>
> src/util/libgsmd-tool -m atcmd
libgsm-tool - (C) 2006 by Harald Welte
This program is Free Software and has ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY

AT+CPAS
STR=`AT+CPAS'
RSTR=`+CPAS: 0'
AT+COPS=?
STR=`AT+COPS=?'
RSTR=`+COPS: (2,"E-Plus","E-Plus","26203"),(3,"o2 - de","o2 - de","26207"),(3,"Vodafone.de","Vodafone","26202"),(3,"T-Mobile D","TMO D","26201")'
</pre>

== Network related functions ==
Operator selection functions were implemented and merged into SVN head[http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/gsmd-devel/2007-September/000216.html]:

The new commands in libgsmd-util are as followings:
  R  -  Register to given operator (R=number)
  P  -  Print current operator
  L  -  Detect available operators
  Q  -  Read signal quality

This is implemented by the functions with "_opers_" naming.
== Currently missing ==

(please add items to this list if you're missing more features)

* Phone related functions
** Airplane mode / gsmd stop (this will be done outside gsmd, by using runlevels / upstart)
** Capability to set-up Emergency Calls, even if the device does not hold a SIM card
** obtain manufacturer/model/revision/IMEI
** Ability to notify user if the SIM card is locked (or even automagically unlock it?)

* SMS related features
** send SMS
** receive SMS
** obtain IMSI
** access to SIM-card stored SMS - ''No longer missing - see help''

* SIM related functions
** read phonebook entry - ''No longer missing - see help'' 
** write phonebook entry - ''No longer missing - see help''

* GPRS related functions
** set up GPRS link, use it via separate DLC of TS07.10 multiplex

* gsmd internal infrastructure
** fine-grained event subscriptions (rather than wildcard-subscribe)
** possibility to specify log-level from command line
** logfile re-opening on SIGUSR1 or SIGHUP (logrotate)
** permission handling
** d-bus interface

== Implementation Thoughts ==

== Testing framework ==

Emulating/mocking the firmware, gsmd and libgsmd can be tested for functionality; on any machine.
See [[User:Kero|Kero's page]] or go directly to [http://chmeee.dyndns.org/om/testing_gsmd.html the (lib)gsmd testing page].

== State tracking ==

gsmd needs to do apropriate state tracking of the underlying GSM hardware.  For many of the state transition we only get events from the GSM Modem, but don't have apropriate query commands.  Thus, assuming gsmd runs all the time, applications can come and go, but still have an idea about the current state of the modem, even if they missed the initial state transitions.

Also, gsmd state tracking allows us to allow for safer interoperability of multiple applications.  If i.e. one applications has just started an outgoing call, gsmd can detect another application who intends to interfere with that and deny access

=== device power state ===

* modem completely off, not responding to AT commands
* modem responding to AT commands, but powered off (CFUN=0)
* modem responding to AT commands, in some power saving mode
* modem responding to AT commands, powered on, fully operational (CFUN=1)

=== Suspend power state ===

It must also configure the modem so that it can on appropriate events wake the system from sleep.

=== network registration state ===

* not registered to any network, not trying to register
* not registred to any network, searching/trying to register
* registered to home network (including cellID)
* registered to roaming network (including cellID)

=== ciphering indication state ===

* ciphering indications not supported by modem
* ciphering indications supported, but disabled in SIM
* ciphering indications supported, ciphering active
* ciphering indications supported, ciphering inactive

=== call state ===

* idle
* busy

Sources of gsmd are kept in [[Openmoko svn]] in src/target/gsm directory.
