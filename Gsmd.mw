== gsmd ==

gsmd is the GSM daemon running in background of the GTA01 phone, managing the actual 'phone' part of the phone :)

=== Usage ===

gsmd is usually started as a daemon in background, but can be run in foreground mode for debugging.

The options can be queried like:
<pre>
> src/gsmd/gsmd --help

This program is FREE SOFTWARE under the terms of GNU GPL

Usage:
        -v      --version       Display program version
        -d      --daemon        Deamonize
        -h      --help          Display this help message
        -p dev  --device dev    Specify serial device to be used
        -s spd  --speed spd     Specify speed in bps (9600,38400,115200,...)
        -l file --logfile file  Specify a logfile to log to
</pre>

If your GSM modem is attached to ttyUSB3, you can e.g. use:
 gsmd -p /dev/ttyUSB3 -s 115200

== libgsmd ==

libgsmd is a library with C language API for application programs.  Programs using this library can use the phone, e.g. make phone calls, receive incoming calls, register to the network, etc.

== libgsmd-tool ==

libgsmd-tool is a small demo applicaiton that can be used to demonstrate the usage of the libgsmd API.

=== Usage ===

libgsmd-tool has multiple modes.  

==== Usage of shell mode ====

Shell mode provides a simple text-based command interface for making voice calls.

The shell mode can be started using

 libgsmd-tool -m shell

It can be used like in the following example:

<pre>
> src/util/libgsmd-tool -m shell

==== Usage of atcmd mode ====

The atcmd mode is a passthrough-mode.  Passthrough means that it accepts [[GSM 07.07]] commands, passes them through the daemon to the phone, and returns you the response.  this is very useful for debugging.

The atcmd mode can be started using

 libgsmd-tool -m atcmd

Usage is like in the following example:

<pre>
> src/util/libgsmd-tool -m atcmd
