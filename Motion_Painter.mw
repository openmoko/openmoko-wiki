'''Short description''':

This project is a change to traditional painting. We utilize the Freerunner's
G-Sensor to help us draw on the panel. This means we can move the Freerunner and then it displays the track over which you moved, enabling users to paint with one hand.

We also provide the ability to let the user choose drawing attributes like colors, bold size, etc.
