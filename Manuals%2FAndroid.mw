= Introduction = 
This page is dedicated to the daily usage of Android on the [[Neo 1973]] and [[Neo FreeRunner]] handsets.

The informations here have been updated for the following release : [http://freerunner.android.koolu.com/release-files Koolu Beta2 Android release]. But should be the same for any not too old release.

You can find general informations (porting/development and day to day usage) about Android and Neo phones here : [[Android]]


= Subsystems =


== Accelerometers ==
Works, can be tested with simple game called [[http://andappstore.com/AndroidPhoneApplications/apps/8872 Amazed]]

Works, latest kernels need permissions for second rfkill interface in init.rc to turn it on.

Once i got it working, you can test with AndNav2 program.

Does not work, GSM get's confused when you try to use it

Sources for libmuxgsm-ril.so not released yet, latest images have binary from ML that works quite fine.
The SIM's PIN code cannot be validated. For now disable the PIN code using another phone.
Registering on a Network seems to be slow and sometimes doesn't work.

= Others =

== Software keyboard ==
Works, can be brought up with short press to power button.

== Suspend ==
Waking up your phone might be a little bit tricky at the moment, there are several recipe/hints submitted by different people :
* 1-2s press of power button goes to sleep, wake up with long power button press, don't use screen timeouts, disable it in Settings->Sound & display->Screen timeout->Never timeout.
* Michael Trimarchi's images allow resume from suspend after two short presses. However, sometimes it takes a few tries for the phone to wake up.
* For me resume works best if i long press power until the main screen appears and the short power press that unlocks screen.
* During suspend the phone seems to wake up make an audible click and go back to sleep.

== USB networking ==
Android doesn't come with an ssh server installed by default. In order to gain shell access without an additional ssh server you can follow the instructions on the [[Android_debug_bridge]]. If you have an ssh server installed, following the general [[USB_Networking]] guide should do.

== USB Host mode ==
If you know how to change the USB mode with Android, please explain it here.

I bought a mini USB keyboard that for my Neo, if someone has simple directions to use it with android, please explain it here.
