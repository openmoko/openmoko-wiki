= Introduction = 
This page is dedicated to the daily usage of Android on the [[Neo 1973]] and [[Neo FreeRunner]] handsets.

The informations here have been updated for the following release : [http://freerunner.android.koolu.com/release-files Koolu Beta2 Android release]. But should be the same for any not too old release.

You can find general informations (porting/development and day to day usage) about Android and Neo phones here : [[Android]]


= Subsystems =


== Accelerometers ==
Works, can be tested with simple game called Amazed

== Bluetooth ==
Works, latest kernels need permissions for second rfkill interface in init.rc to turn it on.

Once i got it working, you can test with AndNav2 program.

Does not work, GSM get's confused when you try to use it

== GSM ==
Sources for libmuxgsm-ril.so not released yet, latest images have binary from ML that works quite fine.
The SIM's PIN code cannot be validated. For now disable the PIN code using another phone.

= Others =

== Software keyboard ==
Works, can be brought up with short press to power button.

== Suspend ==
* Works, can be done with 1s press of power button, wake up with long power button press, don't use screen timeouts, disable it in Settings->Sound & display->Screen timeout->Never timeout.
* Michael Trimarchi's images allow resume from suspend after two short presses. However, sometimes it takes a few tries for the phone to wake up.
* For me resume works best if i long press power until the main screen appears and the short power press that unlocks screen.
* During suspend the phone seems to wake up make an audible click and go back to sleep.
