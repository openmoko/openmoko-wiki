= Introduction = 
This page is dedicated to the daily usage of Android on the [[Neo 1973]] and [[Neo FreeRunner]] handsets.

The informations here have been updated for the following release : [http://freerunner.android.koolu.com/release-files Koolu Beta3 Android release]. But should be the same for any not too old release.

You can find general informations (porting/development and day to day usage) about Android and Neo phones here : [[Android]]

= Getting started =

== The power button ==

* To turn the phone on, press and hold the power button for about 5 seconds
* To wake the phone from sleep, tap the power button twice then once more to unlock the screen

* To turn the phone off, wake it from sleep then hold the power button for about 4-5 seconds. Choose 'Power off' in the menu that appears then click 'OK'

== Making a call ==

Once the phone has started you will see a 'Dialer' icon on the desktop, touch it and you will be presented with a dialling keypad. Enter the number you wish to dial and then touch the bar containing the number to call. If you make  a mistake entering the number you can touch the backspace arrow to the right of the bar.

Caveats
* The volume level when in a voice call is very low

= Subsystems =


== Accelerometers ==
Works, can be tested with simple game called [http://andappstore.com/AndroidPhoneApplications/apps/8872 Amazed] which is already installed on current Koolu images.

== Bluetooth ==
Works, latest kernels need permissions for second rfkill interface in init.rc to turn it on.

== GPS ==
Works, you can [[#Install new software|install]] [http://www.andnav.org AndNav2] (AndNav2 is already installed on current Koolu images) to test it.
It is currently not possible to disable the GPS from the UI once activated.

== GPRS ==
Does not work, GSM get's confused when you try to use it

= Data management =

== Contacts ==

=== Importing ===
==== From Vcard ====
# [[#Install new software|install]] [http://www.dusystems.com/importContacts.html "Android Contacts Import"] (this applications is also available from [[#AndAppStore|AndAppStore]])
# export your contact(s) as a vcard file from your contact application
# [[#Copy files|copy]] the file to your phone /sdcard/ directory
# on your phone run the ImportContacts application, choose the file you copied and select import. Wait until the phone says x vcards imported

That's it if you don't see your contacts, make sure you selected "view all contacts" in the contacts applications options (contacts > powerbutton > Display group > All contacts)

==== From SIM ====
Works, Contacts->menu->Settings->SIM contacts importer.

=== Synchronization ===

== Calendar ==

=== Alarm ===
Works.

=== Importing ===

=== Synchronization ===

== Files ==

=== Copying ===
You can copy files to your phone using either 
* [[#USB mass storage|USB mass storage]]

or, from the command line using

* the [[Android debug bridge]] to copy files to your phone :
 ADBHOST=192.168.0.202 ./adb push file.txt /sdcard/

== Media ==
Can play OGG audio files and view pictures with the default applications

== SMS ==

= Others =

== Software keyboard ==
Works, can be brought up with short press to power button.

== Suspend ==
Waking up your phone might be a little bit tricky at the moment, there are several recipe/hints submitted by different people :
* 1-2s press of power button goes to sleep, wake up with long power button press, don't use screen timeouts, disable it in Settings->Sound & display->Screen timeout->Never timeout.
* Michael Trimarchi's images allow resume from suspend after two short presses. However, sometimes it takes a few tries for the phone to wake up.
* For me resume works best if i long press power until the main screen appears and the short power press that unlocks screen.
* During suspend the phone seems to wake up make an audible click and go back to sleep.

== USB networking ==
The general [[USB Networking]] guide should help you talk to your FreeRunner using IP over USB. However, please note that Android doesn't come with an ssh server installed by default. In order to gain shell access without an additional ssh server you can follow the instructions on the [[Android debug bridge]] page.

== USB Host mode ==
{{todo|If you know how to change the USB mode with Android, please explain it here.}}

== USB keyboard ==
I bought a mini USB keyboard that for my Neo, if someone has simple directions to use it with android, please explain it here.

== USB mass storage ==
This setting is named "Enable USB mass storage". If you don't find it on Settings -> SD card & phone storage, you have to unhide it with [http://www.4shared.com/account/file/76203324/508fa871/Anycut.html Anycut]. Install it then make a new shortcut Activity -> SD Card. Use this new shortcut to activate the option. This is not persistant after a reboot.

{{todo|This doesn't seem to work with the Neo FreeRunner and current Android images.}}

= Software installation and updates =
For initial Android flashing, take a look at: [[Android on Freerunner]]

== Install new software ==
=== Manual install ===
Applications are packaged in .apk packages, to install a package (downloaded on your computer) do 

    ./adb install app.apk

After making sure you can talk to your phone using the [[Android debug bridge]]

=== Package managers ===
==== Android Market Place ====
Currently it is not possible to use the Android Market Place with the Neo Freerunner.

AndAppStore is an alternate source for Android software and works on the Neo Freerunner. It is installed by default in current Koolu images but you can [[#Manual install|install manually]] their [http://andappstore.com/AndroidPhoneApplications/apps/7661 client].
