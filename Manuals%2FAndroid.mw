= Introduction = 
This page is dedicated to the daily usage of Android on the [[Neo 1973]] and [[Neo FreeRunner]] handsets.

The informations here have been updated for the following release : [http://freerunner.android.koolu.com/release-files Koolu Beta2 Android release]. But should be the same for any not too old release.

You can find general informations (porting/development and day to day usage) about Android and Neo phones here : [[Android]]


= Subsystems =


== Accelerometers ==
Works, can be tested with simple game called [http://andappstore.com/AndroidPhoneApplications/apps/8872 Amazed]

== Bluetooth ==
Works, latest kernels need permissions for second rfkill interface in init.rc to turn it on.

== GPS ==
Once it works, you can [[#Install new software|install]] [http://www.andnav.org AndNav2] to test it.

== GPRS ==
Does not work, GSM get's confused when you try to use it

== GSM ==
Sources for libmuxgsm-ril.so not released yet, latest images have binary from ML that works quite fine.
The SIM's PIN code cannot be validated. For now disable the PIN code using another phone.
Registering on a Network seems to be slow and sometimes doesn't work.

== Wifi ==
Works, but i have problems with scanning when just one AP is in range, it fails most of the time.



= Data management =

== Contacts ==

=== Importing ===
==== From Vcard ====
# [[#Install new software|install]] [http://www.dusystems.com/importContacts.html "Android Contacts Import"] (this applications is also available from AndAppStore)
# export your contact(s) as a vcard file from your contact application
# [[#Copy files|copy]] the file to your phone /sdcard/ directory
# on your phone run the ImportContacts application, choose the file you copied and select import. Wait until the phone says x vcards imported

That's it if you don't see your contacts, make sure you selected "view all contacts" in the contacts applications options

==== From SIM ====
Works, Contacts->menu->Settings->SIM contacts importer.

=== Synchronization ===

== Calendar ==

=== Alarm ===
Works.

=== Importing ===

=== Synchronization ===

== Files ==

=== Copying ===
You can copy files to your phone using either 
* [[#USB mass storage|USB mass storage]]

or, from the command line using

* the [[Android debug bridge]] to copy files to your phone :
 ADBHOST=192.168.0.202 ./adb push file.txt /sdcard/

== Media ==
Can play OGG audio files, picture application crashes

== SMS ==
Can't read long SMS messages.

= Others =

== Software keyboard ==
Works, can be brought up with short press to power button.

== Suspend ==
Waking up your phone might be a little bit tricky at the moment, there are several recipe/hints submitted by different people :
* 1-2s press of power button goes to sleep, wake up with long power button press, don't use screen timeouts, disable it in Settings->Sound & display->Screen timeout->Never timeout.
* Michael Trimarchi's images allow resume from suspend after two short presses. However, sometimes it takes a few tries for the phone to wake up.
* For me resume works best if i long press power until the main screen appears and the short power press that unlocks screen.
* During suspend the phone seems to wake up make an audible click and go back to sleep.

== USB networking ==
Android doesn't come with an ssh server installed by default. In order to gain shell access without an additional ssh server you can follow the instructions on the [[Android debug bridge]]. If you have an ssh server installed, following the general [[USB Networking]] guide should do.

== USB Host mode ==
If you know how to change the USB mode with Android, please explain it here.

== USB keyboard ==
I bought a mini USB keyboard that for my Neo, if someone has simple directions to use it with android, please explain it here.

== USB mass storage ==
This setting is named "Enable USB mass storage". If you don't find it on Settings -> SD card & phone storage, you have to unhide it with [http://www.4shared.com/account/file/76203324/508fa871/Anycut.html Anycut]. Install it then make a new shortcut Activity -> SD Card. Use this new shortcut to activate the option. This is not persistant after a reboot.

= Software installation and updates =
For initial Android flashing, take a look at: [[Android on Freerunner]]

== Install new software ==
=== Manual install ===
Applications are packaged in .apk packages, to install a package (downloaded on your computer) do

After making sure you can talk to your phone using the [[Android debug bridge]]

=== Package managers ===
==== Android Market Place ====
Currently it is not possible to use the Android Market Place with the Neo Freerunner.
