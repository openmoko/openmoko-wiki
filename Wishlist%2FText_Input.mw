Current version supports input using [[Input Method|on screen keyboard]].
You can also use Bluetooth keyboards and with (battery) powered USB hub can also use USB keyboards.

Near computer can also use networking over Bluetooth or USB and then ssh into device or run X11 programs remotely and thus use whatever input possibilities other computer supports.

* [http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/ Dasher] ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasher Wikipedia link]): A side-scrolling probabalistic text entry method that's well suited to stylus use. One disadvantage is that it makes little use of muscle memory so you need to pay close attention to the screen while entering text. An andvatage is that it is not limeted to english text, but can be used with any language/alphabet.

===== Text input method surveys =====

Here are some surveys / overviews of text entry methods that I turned up using Google:
* [http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~jhw/text.html Text entry] A web page with a survey of text entry methods by John Williamson
* Poika Isokoski, [http://www.cs.uta.fi/~poika/g/g.html A Minimal Device-Independent Text Input Method], has a chapter listing existing approaches ca. 1999
* Trevor's Trinkets, [http://trevors-trinkets.blogspot.com/2007/07/five-finger-keyboards.html Five Finger Keyboards]

===== Other ways to enter text =====
* Once there is hardware with multi-touch screen support, [[Wishlist:Spell weaving|gesturing with 2-3 fingers]] might offer interesting possibilities.
* Use [[VoiceText|voice to dictate text]]
* Use [[Optical Character Recognition]] and [[Barcode Recognition]] on an image that exists on the file system or via a picture that has just been taken (even if it is a temporary picture only for this purpose).
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedwords Dutton Speedwords]
* I thought long and hard how to make a keyboard fit on the Neo's screen with keys big enough for fingertips.  My idea was to split the keyboard in half similar to how a Natural keyboard does, and use the Aux button to switch between the current displayed half.  I will prepare a sample when I have time.

===== Interesting hardware input devices =====
* [http://mobilitysite.com/2007/02/small-compact-bluetooth-keyboard/ Credit-card sized bluetooth keyboard] (Note: apparently supports only Bluetooth Serial Port Profile and not HID; supportable, of course, perhaps using existing user space daemon [http://handhelds.org/moin/moin.cgi/kbdd kbdd] Link Fixed)
* [http://www.thinkgeek.com/computing/input/8193/ Bluetooth laser virtual keyboard] eventually could be built into the phone once more miniaturized.

Has a spring-loaded hinge for squeezing a phone/PDA against the keyboard; seems like a Neo could attach nicely but don't have one to actually test. --[[User:Mjr|Mjr]] 10:30, 15 May 2007 (CEST)
