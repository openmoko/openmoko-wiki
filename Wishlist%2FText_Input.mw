Current version supports input using [[Input Method|on screen keyboard]].
You can also use Bluetooth keyboards and with (battery) powered USB hub can also use USB keyboards.

Near computer can also use networking over Bluetooth or USB and then ssh into device or run X11 programs remotely and thus use whatever input possibilities other computer supports.

===== Text input method surveys =====

Here are some surveys / overviews of text entry methods that I turned up using Google:
* [http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~jhw/text.html Text entry] A web page with a survey of text entry methods by John Williamson
* Poika Isokoski, [http://www.cs.uta.fi/~poika/g/g.html A Minimal Device-Independent Text Input Method], has a chapter listing existing approaches ca. 1999

===== Other ways to enter text =====
* Once there is hardware with multi-touch screen support, [[Wishlist:Spell weaving|gesturing with 2-3 fingers]] might offer interesting possibilities.
* Use [[VoiceText|voice to dictate text]]
* Use [[Optical Character Recognition]] and [[Barcode Recognition]] on an image that exists on the file system or via a picture that has just been taken (even if it is a temporary picture only for this purpose).
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedwords Dutton Speedwords]

===== Interesting hardware input devices =====
* [http://www.mobilitysite.com/2007/02/small_compact_bluetooth_keyboard.php Credit-card sized bluetooth keyboard] (Note: apparently supports only Bluetooth Serial Port Profile and not HID; supportable, of course, perhaps using existing user space daemon [http://handhelds.org/moin/moin.cgi/kbdd kbdd])
* [http://www.thinkgeek.com/computing/input/8193/ Bluetooth laser virtual keyboard]
* [http://www.thinkgeek.com/computing/input/6c82/ Frogpad]
* [http://www.spartechnik.de/start.htm?d_Keyb_Mini_Mini_Bluetooth_Keyboard_im_Scheckkartenformat.htm Freedom Mini], apparently not manufactured anymore but still sold and works out of the box with Bluez' hidd. Has a spring-loaded hinge for squeezing a phone/PDA against the keyboard; seems like a Neo could attach nicely but don't have one to actually test. --[[User:Mjr|Mjr]] 10:30, 15 May 2007 (CEST)
