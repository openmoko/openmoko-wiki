==Distributions==

{{DistributionBox|
Name=Debian GNU/Linux |
Description=[[Debian]] is a universal operating system used on many embedded devices, servers and home computers. Using Debian on the FreeRunner gives access to the huge army of software packaged in the Debian repositories, already compiled for the Neo's ARM(v4) processor. Moreover, one can build one's own source files for programs without having to learn the OpenEmbedded way. For an existing Debian/Ubuntu user, choosing Debian for Neo FreeRunner makes phone a very familiar, trustworthy and flexible place to hack in.<br><br>
General news:
<br>
* New Openmoko specific Linux 2.6.34 kernel is now available as a package in the pkg-fso repository! Just do apt-get install linux-image-2.6.34-openmoko-gta02 (and check the symbolic links in /boot). Details at http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2010-October/063463.html
* While Debian itself is in freeze, omhacks 0.12 with newer kernel support and more was released at the pkg-fso repository: http://pkg-fso.nomeata.de/sid/omhacks
* The main information wiki page was put up-to-date: http://wiki.debian.org/DebianOnFreeRunner
* Even the most conservative daily FR phone users might be willing to upgrade at least to latest FSO1 stack: http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/User:TimoJyrinki#currentphonestack - of course, FSO2 (fso-gsmd) is also packaged and waiting for users...

==General News==

Most important and change making mails on the mailing lists, blogs etc.. Coolest hacks, screenshots, themes etc..

=== GPRS ===

* GPRS on FreeRunner is unstable? Too many connections hang the modem? Unfixable? NO MORE! Our magician [[User:Lindi|lindi]] has conjured a tc (traffic control) command that makes the data flow more stable even under heavy load. Huge thanks! http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/2264#comment:21 (use the lower one for faster operation)
