This is a page detailing accessories that may be of use for your Neo1973.

This is both accessories that do not exist, and existing devices that may be good to add to a web-store.

Advertising on this page is permitted, but keep it brief and factual.

==Input Devices==

===Pedometer===

There are (at least) two uses for a Bluetooth pedometer as a Neo1973 accessory:

* As an input device for exercise-monitoring software

* A pedometer combined with a compass (see [[Wish_List_-_Hardware#Digital_compass]]) would allow the positioning software to perform [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning dead reckoning] when the GPS signal has been lost. The US Army's [http://www.army-technology.com/projects/land_warrior/ Land Warrior system] already does this. (Maybe the pedometer is partly redundant with the accelerometers for dead reckoning tasks? See the [http://www.autospectator.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=9942 SiRFDiRect announcement].)

==Special covers==
Different special covers could be made available with features like:
* A standard slip-on or clip-on template (possibly with buttons) to make the touch-screen blind accessible
* Small metal frame for protection (like Siemens M65, only with more style)
* Case with mirror on the back, for putting on makeup/checking appearance or helping with self-portraits with an integrated camera.
* Option to completely design printable case styles, perhaps with engraving. Ability to share these on a 'community' site.
* Solar powered recharger (perhaps as extendable/unfoldable [[Expansion Back]]).
* Rubber protection like available for iPod, of course in different colors and transparency.

==Car kit==
A car kit with a cradle which simultaneously recharges the device.

==Charger conversion connector==
A flexible converter allowing you to recharge the Neo1973 with power from many DC sources such as other devices chargers.
Problems are that it may overload the DC source. It may require sensing of the input voltage, and reducing load if the voltage drops by a factor. Ideally the device should accept input voltage in the range of around 3.3v-28V in either polarity.
