This is a page detailing accessories that may be of use for your Neo1973.

This is both accessories that do not exist, and existing devices that may be good to add to a web-store.

===Pedometer===

There are (at least) two uses for a Bluetooth pedometer as a Neo1973 accessory:

* As an input device for exercise-monitoring software

* A pedometer combined with a compass (see [[Wish_List_-_Hardware#Digital_compass]]) would allow the positioning software to perform [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning dead reckoning] when the GPS signal has been lost. The US Army's [http://www.army-technology.com/projects/land_warrior/ Land Warrior system] already does this. (Maybe the pedometer is partly redundant with the accelerometers for dead reckoning tasks? See the [http://www.autospectator.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=9942 SiRFDiRect announcement].)
