gpe-scap is an gui-application for taking screenshots of your mobile phone. It offers the possibility of saving the taken screenshots or uploading them to http://scap.linuxtogo.org .

= Installation =
gpe-scap is in the offical [[Om2008.8|2008.8]] repository and can be installed with the [[Om2008.8_Installer|gui-installer]] via: ''"INSTALLER -> install -> Miscellaneous -> gpe-scap''".

Alternativly one can install it via the command line with: 
 opkg install gpe-scap
= Usage =
== Gui ==
After installation there's an icon with the name ''"Take screenshot"'' on the mainscreen. With pressing the icon gpe-scap is started and takes a screenshot. The big disadvantage with this method is, that gpe-scap can just do a screenshot of the place where it was started and it always takes a screenshot with it's own loading-symbol which renders this method of taking a screenshot totally useless.
== ssh ==
The other and way better method of taking a screenshot with gpe-scap is doing it via ssh. For this method one has to open the window, menu or whatever he wants to take a screenshot of on his device. Then you connect via ssh to the device and execute:
 DISPLAY=:0 gpe-scap
Now you get a perfect screenshot of whatever you want.
