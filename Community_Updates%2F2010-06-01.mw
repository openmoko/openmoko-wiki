Name= [[GameRunner]] [0.2]|
Description=
GameRunner is an Openmoko Linux distribution. It aims at converting the Freerunner open mobile phone in a Linux-based handheld game console. It is simple, and contains cool and suitable open source games for Linux mobile devices. 

New stuff :
* new simple app fileselector (finger friendly), useful for Super Nintendo Emulator and Mplayer
* added Snes9x (Super Nintendo Emulator), Mplayer, GNURobbo, fatfingershell, and Block Rage game
* pressing power button any time quits the current game (resets X and GUI)
* added help screen for every game using GameRunner game control
The help screen also asks user to start the game with sound or no sound.

Changes :
* fixes in Gamerunner game control : works always and better. Now red aux
button light means mode 2, so we can know which mode is the current one.
Touchscreen control is more accurate.

{{DistributionBox|
Name=SHR [unstable]|


Description=SHR is a community driven GNU/Linux distribution for smartphones based on OpenEmbedded using E17 (illume) as window manager and own gui apps on top of FSO.

Most important changes from last month are:

* ogsmd written in python was replaced with fsogsmd written in vala, which is much faster and uses less memory
* All SHR apps were adjusted to slightly changed api of gsm daemon and now everything works out-of-the box with fsogsmd
* SMSs are no longer temporary saved to SIM
* Deep-sleep and echo cancellation for calypso is configureable in fsogsmd config.
* HAL is no longer installed by default
* Toolchain is continuously upgraded (now we're using eglibc-2.12, gcc-4.4.4 and we're testing gcc-4.5 which should generate faster code for our armv4t).
* [http://git.openembedded.org/cgit.cgi/openembedded/log/ Changelog for all libs/apps included in image]
* [http://git.shr-project.org/git/ Changelog for SHR apps]

* We are testing newer 2.6.32 and 2.6.34 kernels [http://build.shr-project.org/shr-kms/ available here], please read readme there and test it too.
