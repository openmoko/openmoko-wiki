You will need the [[Dfu-util]] to make a backup of your existing image.

As when [[Flashing_the_Neo_FreeRunner|flashing]], you will need to be in [[FreeRunner/Buttons_and_LEDs#Basic_Button_Usage|U-Boot in the NOR Flash]].

THIS WILL TAKE AWHILE.  The rootfs will take significantly longer than the kernel.

<pre>
./dfu-util -a kernel -B -U good-kernel.bin
./dfu-util -a rootfs -R -U good-rootfs.jffs2
</pre>

Here is what my successful output looked like...

on the host PC:
<pre>
$ sudo ./dfu-util -a kernel -R -U good-kernel.img

Despite the fact that there was a device status with state=dfuERROR, everything seems to have worked.

on the FreeRunner:
<pre>
DFU: Switching to DFU Mode
DEVICE_CONFIGURED: 1
Starting DFU Upload of partition 'kernel'
DEVICE_CONFIGURED: 1
Starting DFU Upload of partition 'rootfs'
</pre>
