== Backing up just PIM data ==

The following applies to all Qtopia PIM suite based derivations (FDOM, 2008.8, Qtopia). PIM data covers:

 * Contacts, calendar appointments, and tasks
 * E-Mails and text messages

To make a backup which can be easily restored later on use secure copy:

 scp -pr root@192.168.0.202:~/Applications/ .
 scp -pr root@192.168.0.202:~/Documents/ .

To restore do the reverse:

 scp -pr Applications root@192.168.0.202:~/
 scp -pr Documents root@192.168.0.202:~/

Make sure you restart to allow the Qtopia PIM suite to see the changes:

 reboot

This way we can flash applicable distributions with minimal effort without loosing important data. To access the PIM data on the computer take a look at the following files and folders:

* Contacts, calendar appointments, and tasks are kept in <tt>~/Applications/Qtopia/qtopia_db.sqlite</tt>.
* E-Mails and text messages are kept in <tt>~/Applications/qtmail/mail/</tt>.

== Backing up just /home/root ==

To backup the home folder (all your personal files in theory).

From the desktop pc run:

 ssh root@phone 'tar -cpz /home/root' > moko-home-`date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S`.tar.gz

Where '''<tt>phone</tt>''' is the ip address of your phone (192.168.0.202).

Personally I added an entry to /etc/hosts so the above works for me. I also added the desktop key to /home/root/.ssh/authorized_keys on the phone as per the instructions in [[USB_Networking#SSH_Keys]].

If you want to check what is in the backup, run the following, replacing the filename with what was just created.

 tar -tzf moko-home-20080802-203108.tar.gz | less

== Backing up everything ==

You may either :
* Backup the flash contents, in order to be able to restore (see below)
* or move the system to SD to be able to boot it from SD in case of need. See [[Moving current system from flash to SD]]

=== Backing-up flash images ===

{{note|Upload support is currently broken - [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/676 #676], [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1843 #1843]}}

You will need the [[Dfu-util]] to make a backup of your existing image.

As when [[Flashing_the_Neo_FreeRunner|flashing]], you will need to be in [[Booting_the_Neo_FreeRunner#Log_into_U-Boot_in_the_NOR_Flash|U-Boot in the NOR Flash]]. Log into the NOR uBoot menu and select ''Set console to USB'' (for FreeRunner just stay in NOR uBoot menu, do not select or enter anything). Now you will be able to flash, make backups of your FreeRunner or query the FreeRunner with [[Dfu-util|dfu-util]].  Backup is fairly slow; it took over ten minutes to back up a 247 MB rootfs.

It is important that you connect the USB cable directly from your computer to your phone.  If there is a hub between them, backup (and flashing) will mostly likely fail.

{{note|On a Windows host, omit the "./" or "sudo ./" that precedes the commands listed on this page}}

<pre>
sudo ./dfu-util -a kernel -R -U good-kernel.bin
sudo ./dfu-util -a rootfs -R -U good-rootfs.jffs2
sudo ./dfu-util -a splash -R -U good-splash.bin
sudo ./dfu-util -a u-boot -R -U good-u-boot.bin
sudo ./dfu-util -a u-boot_env -R -U good-u-boot_env.bin
</pre>

Here is what a successful dfu-util backup run looks like:

on the host PC:
<pre>
$ sudo ./dfu-util -a kernel -R -U good-kernel.img

A failed run of dfu-util looks like this:

And shows demsg errors like this:
<pre>
usb 5-2: usbfs: USBDEVFS_CONTROL failed cmd dfu-util rqt 161 rq 2 len 4096 ret -110
</pre>
This error is detected within the Linux USB stack (drivers/usb/core/message.c) and looking at
errno.h for the negatived error status number, the reason is e.g.
{|
| 110 || ETIMEDOUT || Connection timed out
|-
|  84 || EILSEQ    || Illegal byte sequence
|-
| 108 || ESHUTDOWN || Cannot send after transport endpoint shutdown
|-
| ... ||           ||
|}
Insure yourself, that you connect the FR directly to the computer (without any USB hubs), if you experience timed out connections
and use the

 dfu-util -d [[USB Product IDs|0x1d50:0x5119]] ...

option, if the FR is not detected properly.

=== Backing-up flash images (alternative) ===

On the device:
<pre>
mkdir /var/tmp/root
mount /dev/root /var/tmp/root
</pre>

If you have om2008.9 you have to use:
<pre>
mount -t jffs2 /dev/mtdblock6 /var/tmp/root
</pre>

On your workstation:
<pre>
ssh root@192.168.0.202 "mkfs.jffs2 -d /var/tmp/root -e 128 --pad --no-cleanmarkers -x lzo" | pv -W > rootfs.jffs2
</pre>
(The "| pv -W" is optional, it just gives you something to watch as the bytes fly by.)

On the device:
<pre>
umount /var/tmp/root
</pre>

=== Backing-up in a tar archive ===

 ssh root@192.168.0.202 "tar c /bin /etc /home /lib /opt /sbin /tmp /usr /var" | pv -s 2200000 -W > rootfs.tar
(The "| pv -W" is optional, it just gives you something to watch as the bytes fly by; the "-s" option presume you're transferring 2200000 bytes of data)

Extract it and use <code>mkfs.jffs2</code> if you want convert it to a jffs2 image.

==Backup Scripts==

If you plan on backing up frequently, using a script will simplify the process:

===Simple backup script===

This script works well if you want to configure it to backup always the same device.

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
#
# Back up all partitions of the phone to a backup directory,
# adding today's date to the saved filenames.

DATE=`date +%Y-%m-%d`
DFU=./dfu-util
BACKUP_DIR=bak/

${DFU} -a kernel -R -U ${BACKUP_DIR}kernel-${DATE}.bin
${DFU} -a rootfs -R -U ${BACKUP_DIR}rootfs-${DATE}.jffs2
${DFU} -a splash -R -U ${BACKUP_DIR}splash-${DATE}.bin
${DFU} -a u-boot -R -U ${BACKUP_DIR}u-boot-${DATE}.bin
${DFU} -a u-boot_env -R -U ${BACKUP_DIR}u-boot_env-${DATE}.bin
</pre>

===Interactive script===

This script is based on the above "Simple backup script" (by unknown). It does the backup of what you want and choose promting you for choices. Enjoy it! test it! contribute! You can find us at /server irc.freenode.net /j #openmoko and we'll be pleased to accept you help (ideas || code).                                

NOTE that the script works for me(tm) but it still needs some love. especially on traps and catches for wrong choices.

=== Pretty GUI Script ===

[[NeoTool]] is a zenity-based script which allows you to both backup and Flash your device from a pretty GUI. It uses both the dfu-util method and the alternate method described on this page, and can produce flashable images of everything including rootfs. Check it out.

== Backing up the incremental rsync hardlink way ==

Following is a very simple implementation of
[http://www.mikerubel.org/computers/rsync_snapshots/ incremental rsync snapshots with hardlinks]. Just put it to /etc/cron.daily/backup-neo
on your PC and setup ssh keys between your PC and neo. It will then
daily try to backup all files in the / partition. Each successful
backup is hardlinked under a timestamped directory so you can access
old backups easily. In fact, you can even NFS mount /backup/neo to
phone and then chroot inside the backups to run programs in the
backup'ed environment.
 #!/bin/bash
 # /etc/cron.daily/backup-neo
 rsync --delete -ax --numeric-ids 192.168.0.202:/ /backup/neo/latest 2>  /dev/null
 ret=$?
 
 case $ret in
 0)
         # backup done, let's save it
         cp -al /backup/neo/latest /backup/neo/`date -I`
         ;;
 12)
         # neo was not at home
         ;;
 *)
         echo "backup failed with return value $ret"
         ;;
 esac

== Backing up internal flash when booted on external SD-card ==

 #Freerunner
 mkdir internal_flash
 mount /dev/mtdblock6 internal_flash -t jffs2

Now you can pack directory or copy selected files out from it.

(This mounting is usefull also if your internal operating system is non-bootable. You can get files out or even repair the system using operating system on external card.)
