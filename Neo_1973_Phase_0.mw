== Software Image ==

We were using u-boot, kernel and rootfs images from http://people.openmoko.org/werner/devirginate-20070301.tar.gz
to pre-install the devices. This is a self-contained [[devirginator]] snapshot, and can be used at any given time to fully restore the phone (complete loss of data is implied)

== Errata ==

* u-boot can power-off the phone while in DFU mode
