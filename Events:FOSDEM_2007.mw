That's pretty easy. The venue is linked to above. You can also try to recognize some of the guys by looking at http://flickr.com/photos/koenkooi/sets/72157594516863220/ and http://flickr.com/photos/koenkooi/sets/72157594436178138/ (Photos courtesy Koen Kooi).

Those lucky developers who already have a NEO1973 by then can hang it around their neck, on proud display, that should catch the attention.

All those poor sods who are still waiting for their NEO can '''FAKE IT''':

Print the following PDF on stiff card, cut along the outline, and cut out the strap-hole, stick the two sides together and hang the resulting life-sized fake NEO from you FOSDEM neck-strap!

In case you wonder what that looks like, here's a PNG of the same thing:

Ohh ok, it's just a bit of nerdy fun...
