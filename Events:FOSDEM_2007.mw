Sean mentioned being at the beer event himself, to quote the most important part of that exchange:

That's pretty easy. The venue is linked to above.
Those lucky developers who already have a NEO1973 by then can hang it around their neck, on proud display, that should catch the attention.

All those poor sods who are still waiting for their NEO can '''FAKE IT''':

Print the following PDF on stiff card, cut along the outline, and cut out the strap-hole, stick the two sides together and hang the resulting life-sized fake NEO from you FOSDEM neck-strap!

Ohh ok, it's just a bit of nerdy fun...

It seems I'm not the only one who likes faking it, Ole Tange put together something similar here:
