=== Introduction ===
I thought it would be nice to have a user group for ppl from Aachen. Possible we could organize some meetings in the near future, seeing how the FreeRunner has been available for a while now. (mine is shipped, and hopefully on its way)

=== People ===
[[User:Henrikz|Henrikz]] (eagerly awating my freerunner)
