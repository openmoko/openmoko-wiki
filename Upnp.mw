I tried [https://coherence.beebits.net/ Coherence] on the om2008.8 and it works as a MediaServer. (Tested with a PS3 as a MediaRenderer)

You first need to install [http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ Twisted] and [http://pylouie.org/ Louie]

Maybe some tweaking can be done to use the OM as a MediaRenderer?
