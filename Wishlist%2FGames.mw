=== Games on OpenMoko ===

This is the page to centralize the suggestions for creating games on the OpenMoko device.

===== Existing game concepts that could be realized =====
* Simple Flash games like [http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/squares2.php  Squares2] are often very addicting and good for short playing sessions. Other examples: Bejewelled, Zoo Keeper, [http://novelconcepts.co.uk/FlashElementTD/ Flash Element TD ],  ... 
* A classic shooter can work well with continous fire and touchscreen controls. An example is Kenta Cho's Java version of [http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/java/noiz2_e.html Noiz2]   
* Same is true for a 3D shooter with no/seldom used additional controls. For example a combat flying game like Hunt for the [http://www.smallrockets.com/pc/baron/ Red Baron]. You can control the speed with a slider, shoot rockets and drop bombs with special buttons but those are things you only need from time to time. Most of the time you are shooting continously and aiming which can be done in the corner of the touchscreen (so it doesn't obstruct your view). 
* Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan/Elite Beat Agents - Rhythm-based touching of circles and paths on the screen is a great concept and shouldn't be that difficult to pull off if you leave out some of the great presentation.
* Pac Pix - The necessary shape-recognition would probably be difficult to manage with a small budget but the general idea is quite cool.
* Kirby Canvas Curse - Again, not easy to do with a small budget.
* Burning Sand/Falling Sand- already supported on a DS [http://siebn.de/]

===== Candidates for porting/cross compiling =====
* [http://www.openttd.com Transport Tycoon Deluxe]. Very possible, in fact the author of the Palm & GP2X ports of the game is already interested in OpenMoko.
* [http://www.aeonflame.com/ Gloop Zero] - A little like physics-based Lemmings. Get the liquid from one part of the level to another with tools like path-drawing, bombs, anti-gravity...
* [http://www.clickgamer.com/moreinfo.htm?pid=4188&section=PALM Plazmoids!] - A space game with screen-size levels. Move your ship around by touching where it should go. Collect the plazmoids (asteroids) by catching them in your elastic tractor beam (lots of simple physics again), shoot enemies with a button or double tap.
* [http://redshift.hu/ Legacy] (and successor The Quest) - Classic first person turn based RPG. Movement and menus can completely be controlled with the touchscreen.
* [http://www.warfareincorporated.com/ Warfare Inc.] - A full real time strategy game is no problem with a touchscreen. In fact, it's a lot of fun!
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic Heroes of Might and Magic] maybe can be port this [http://www.pocketheroes.net/ Pocket Heroes] for PocketPC
* Command & Conquer and Red Alert - [http://sourceforge.net/projects/freera/ FreeRA] or [http://freecnc.org/ FreeCNC]
* [http://www.fade-team.com/acedior.htm Acedior] - A classic graphic adventure game.
* [http://www.frozen-bubble.org/ Frozen Bubble] 
* GJeweled
* [http://www.bridgebuilder-game.com Bridge Builder]
* Pipe Dreams
* [http://www.scummvm.org/ ScummVM] - Allows you to run certain classic graphical point-and-click adventure games
* [http://dosbox.sourceforge.net/ DOSBox] - would give the Opportunity to play dozens of DOS Games, like [http://www.abandonia.com/games/en/466/LandsofLore.htm Lands of Lore]
* [http://www.tucows.com/preview/9259 Gem Drop]
* that addictive Photo game where you have to spot the 5 differences in x seconds
* Checkers, Chess, Minesweeper (interesting touchscreen variation: [http://toyspring.com/3dm/ 3D Mines] by Toyspring, Solitaire, Mahjong, Connect Four, Tic-tac-toe, Black Jack
* Creating a Nethack port could be done. Tony said on the list: "I'm not entirely sure yet. I imagine I'll first do a text port with a "portal" view (in which you only see a part of the screen at a time), and a user-selected font size. Then I'd try a tiles-based port. It all depends on how readable the text is on the small screen."
* [http://www.mame.net/ MAME] - Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator.  This versatile emulator turns a given platform into a powerful gaming system.  It has been ported to WinCE and many UNIX flavors as well.  It would be wonderul to have this on the OpenMoko.
* [http://gnome-sudoku.sourceforge.net/ Gnome Sudoku]
* [http://web.mit.edu/xiphmont/Public/gPlanarity.html gPlanarity] would be a nice stylus game.
* [http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/ Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection] is GTK based and includes, among others, both Sudoku and Planarity style games called Solo and Untangle.
* [http://www.mess.org/ MESS] - Multiple Emulator Super System. To emulate old computers like TI 99/4A, C64, ...
* Racing Games, like [http://xmoto.sourceforge.net/ XMoto], [http://vdrift.net/ VDrift], [http://ecksdee.sourceforge.net/ Ecksdee] or more likely [http://www.emhsoft.com/ttrooper/ Torus Trooper]

===== General ideas about games on OpenMoko =====
* A easy network library for Bluetooth and/or GPRS connectivity.
* Every turn-based game should be possible with on screen buttons. 
* Action games should need only one main control action most of the time such as moving somewhere on a 2D plane, aiming in 3D, drawing a path. Special items and actions are possible but should only be needed from time to time. There is no solution for first person shooter type games where you move and aim independently. 
* The finger getting into the way of seeing what's going on is a problem. Most games would probably need a stylus. Games with first person aiming can be controlled with a thumb in one corner of the screen, however you'd probably need one of them thumbstraps they make for the DS so that your thumb glides over the screen with ease.
* GPS can be used for location based games. An example is [http://codeninja.de/tron/ Tron]. Links to location-based/Alternate Reality games in these [http://del.icio.us/tallpaul/games+street del.icio.us pages]
* Bluetooth controllers should be supported. I am especially thinking about the Nintendo Wii remote.
* Virtually Real Games; the OpenMoko, with it's network connectivity and loads of basic features, could be used to invent/encourage a new(ish) style of game that mixes reality and tech. A basic version would be urban tag; you get close to someone and the buzzer beeps faster, say. There's so many more creative possibilities though.

What is not possible without magic tricks / an external controller*:
* Classic first person shooters, action adventures, jump 'n' runs
* Emulators for classic systems
* Network lib for easy Bluetooth and/or GPRS connections.
* Bluetooth controllers should be supported. I am especially thinking about the Nintendo Wii remote.
* If version 2 of the hardware has an accelerometer a [http://www.rubylane.com/shops/molotov/item/SUN1769 tilt maze ball game] is possible.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Much of this could be accomplished with [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Wish_List#More.2FCustom_Input_Method_Widgets Custom Input Method Widgets] for the keyboard.
