=== Games on Openmoko ===

This is the page to centralize the suggestions for creating games on the Openmoko device. See also existing [[Games]].

===== Existing game concepts that could be realized =====
* [http://www.kloonigames.com/blog/general/crayon-physics-deluxe-on-a-tablet-pc/ crayon physics deluxe] and [http://numptyphysics.garage.maemo.org/ Numpty Physics] You play with crayons and physics. The goal of the game is to move the red ball so that it collects the stars. You can cause the red ball to move by drawing physical objects.(DONE)
* Simple Flash games like [http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/squares2.php  Squares2] are often very addicting and good for short playing sessions. Other examples: Bejewelled, Zoo Keeper, [http://novelconcepts.co.uk/FlashElementTD/ Flash Element TD ],  [http://www.addictinggames.com/4secondfrenzy.html 4 second frenzy] ... 
* A classic shooter can work well with continous fire and touchscreen controls. An example is Kenta Cho's Java version of [http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/java/noiz2_e.html Noiz2]   
* Same is true for a 3D shooter with no/seldom used additional controls. For example a combat flying game like Hunt for the [http://www.smallrockets.com/pc/baron/ Red Baron]. You can control the speed with a slider, shoot rockets and drop bombs with special buttons but those are things you only need from time to time. Most of the time you are shooting continously and aiming which can be done in the corner of the touchscreen (so it doesn't obstruct your view). Use accelerators for steering?
* Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan/Elite Beat Agents - Rhythm-based touching of circles and paths on the screen is a great concept and shouldn't be that difficult to pull off if you leave out some of the great presentation.
* Pac Pix - The necessary shape-recognition would probably be difficult to manage with a small budget but the general idea is quite cool.
* Kirby Canvas Curse - Again, not easy to do with a small budget.
* Burning Sand/Falling Sand- already supported on a DS [http://siebn.de/]
** try [https://projects.openmoko.org/projects/particule/ Particule]
* Breakout - all you need to do is move the paddle back and forth
* Pong - same as above (DONE)
* [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_Builder Bridge Builder] - setting up Architectures, with a limited Budget and see if it can withstand. Doesn't have to be limited on Bridges.
* Volfied - you cut pieces of the screen while dodging baddies and you win when you get to X%. (This probably mean something like [http://games.kde.org/kde_arcade.php KBounce], or another jezz ball clone)

===== Candidates for porting/cross compiling =====

* [http://www.nethack.org/ Nethack] - Nethack port could be done. Tony said on the list: "I'm not entirely sure yet. I imagine I'll first do a text port with a "portal" view (in which you only see a part of the screen at a time), and a user-selected font size. Then I'd try a tiles-based port. It all depends on how readable the text is on the small screen."

Collect the plazmoids (asteroids) by catching them in your elastic tractor beam (lots of simple physics again), shoot enemies with a button or double tap. need to find a similar game with the sources...because porting a game without access to its sources is nearly impossible

Here is info how to get it running on FreeRunner: [http://www.wesnoth.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=22124&start=0&st=0&sk=t&sd=a]
* [http://www.wormux.org/wiki/en/index.php wormux] (it works without 3d acceleration) the game is playable in 640x480 even if the icon play and quit of the menu aren't displayed entierely(but we can click on them)
* [http://www.xmoto.tuxfamily.org X-Moto] - A cross game like Elastomania (but better ^^) that can be runned with SDL instead of OpenGL which it normally uses.

===== General ideas about games on Openmoko =====
* A proper OpenGL ES library (preferably SDL) for the SMedia chip.
* An easy network library for Bluetooth and/or GPRS connectivity.
* Every turn-based game should be possible with on screen buttons. 
* Action games should need only one main control action most of the time such as moving somewhere on a 2D plane, aiming in 3D, drawing a path. Special items and actions are possible but should only be needed from time to time. Moving and aiming independently could be done by using the accelerometers for walking and the touchscreen for aiming.
* The finger getting into the way of seeing what's going on is a problem. Most games would probably need a stylus. Games with first person aiming can be controlled with a thumb in one corner of the screen, however you'd probably need one of them thumbstraps they make for the DS so that your thumb glides over the screen with ease.
* GPS can be used for location based games. An example is [http://codeninja.de/tron/ Tron]. Links to location-based/Alternate Reality games in these [http://del.icio.us/tallpaul/games+street del.icio.us pages]
* Bluetooth controllers should be supported. I am especially thinking about the Nintendo Wii remote.
* Virtually Real Games; the Openmoko, with it's network connectivity and loads of basic features, could be used to invent/encourage a new(ish) style of game that mixes reality and tech. A basic version would be urban tag; you get close to someone and the buzzer beeps faster, say. There's so many more creative possibilities though.

What is not possible without magic tricks / an external controller*:
* Classic first person shooters, action adventures, jump 'n' runs
* Emulators for classic systems
* Network lib for easy Bluetooth and/or GPRS connections.
* Bluetooth controllers should be supported. I am especially thinking about the Nintendo Wii remote.
* If version 2 of the hardware has an accelerometer a [http://www.rubylane.com/shops/molotov/item/SUN1769 tilt maze ball game] is possible.

===== Accelerometer based games =====
* Sliding block games, to reassemble pictures.
* Rolling ball games, where you navigate a ball or balls through a maze.
** Multiplayer versions of the above - who can get the ball to the hole first?
* Motorbike game...do you imagine rear up your Ninja taking up your phone??
* PlanetPenguinRacer-like game.
* Snake
* 2D Spacefight game (up/down -maybe left/right- to navigate your fighter and shot button(s))



*Reallife RPG Firstpersonshooter

**RL-RPG-FPS
**Neo as board computers

**Bluetooth DEVICE with:
***3d Accerometer
***3d compass
*** various buttons to fire etc.

**wlan servers as gamarea
*** with shot direction becomes via compass
*** own psoition via gps
*** kind of the weapon
*** over wlan transfer 
*** and enemydevice announces hit
