===Booting===
'''Q: I can't boot Neo with charger?'''  

'''A:'''
1. You can't boot GTA02 without a spare battery. You should boot Neo with spare battery and attach your charger, then you can boot into neo.

2. Once your phone is booted, remove the spare battery. Freerunner will remain running, 

3. Insert dead battery and let it charge.

'''Q:Uable to flash FreeRunner after booting either into NAND or NOR.'''
{{note|Please check [[Getting_Started_with_your_Neo_FreeRunner]] for more information about the flashing image.}}
 
I can ssh into the phone via USB per the wiki instructions, but dfu-util does not find the phone. 

This is what I need to run as root and the everything works fine:
 root(eno,freerunner)# cat upom
 #!/bin/sh
 /sbin/ifconfig usb0 192.168.0.200 netmask 255.255.255.0
 /sbin/route add -host 192.168.0.202/32 dev usb0

=== GSM ===

==== SIM compatibility ====
'''Q:'''Sim card is not working, how do I run diagnostics?
'''A:'''
Here is the "how to" check.

Follow [[Manually_using_GSM|this]] until you get an OK prompt.

==== GSM/GPRS information ====

Following page contain very usaful information:

* [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Gsmd GSM Daemon]

* [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Gsm General GSM page]

* [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Hardware:AT_Commands AT commands]

=== GPS ===

For general GPS introduction, you could find it at [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/GTA02_GPS GTA02 GPS]

=== Wi-Fi ===

==== How do I get the wlan working? ====
See [[GTA02 WLAN]]

=== Display ===

==== Can it play VGA video? ====

No, it can do about 20 fps QVGA with software, and something beetween QVGA and VGA playing MPEG-4 using hardware (at resonable fps). Scaling is also done with GPU hardware.

==== How to change the background picture of the root window? ====

Copy '''whatyouwant.png''' over '''/usr/share/pixmaps/wallpaper.png''', best results may come up with pictures that have '''width=480''' and '''height=640'''. I think that the X-server must be restarted, at least it will show up after the next boot.

=== Software ===

==== Does it support Java? ====
There is a [https://wiki.evolvis.org/jalimo/index.php/OpenMoko port of Jalimo] for Openmoko.

==== Does it support Flash? So can I watch YouTube? ====
