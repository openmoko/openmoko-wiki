== FreeRunner (GTA02): known hardware-related issues ==

There is a collection of known FreeRunner hardware issues at the wiki page [[Freerunner_Hardware_Issues]]; reading that page could help you quickly solve those issues.

==Booting==
=== Why won't the FreeRunner boot even with the charger connected? ===

'''A:'''
Early builds of the FreeRunner<sup>1</sup> have the issue that the phone needs to boot fully to enable charging of the battery. However, current supplied via the charger is not sufficient to boot the phone; some power is required from the battery as well<sup>2</sup>. If you've let your battery discharge totally, the only recommended<sup>3</sup> way to boot the FreeRunner is with a spare battery. If you don't have a spare battery specifically for the FreeRunner, you can also use a Nokia battery (see [[Neo FreeRunner Battery]] for a list of compatible batteries). 

1. Put in the spare battery and plug in your charger, and let the phone boot.

2. Once your phone has booted, remove the spare battery. The FreeRunner should continue running on power drawn from the charger.

3. Insert the dead battery and let it charge.

Notes:

*<sup>1</sup> http://n2.nabble.com/HW-problems-...-tp759770p759791.html and http://n2.nabble.com/HW-problems-...-tp759770p760234.html imply that FreeRunners built during and after July 2008 no longer have this problem, but this has not been officially confirmed.

=== How do I find out what image versions are in use on the phone? ===

'''A:''' You can run the commands given below on the phone (in an SSH session from your host PC, or in the Terminal application on the phone itself)
{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" align="left"
! To find out
! Run
|- 
| Kernel version that is currently running
| 
  uname -a
|-
| The version of the root filesystem that you are currently using
| 
  cat /etc/version 
or 
  cat /etc/om-version
|-
| The versions of u-boot on the phone (The FreeRunner has one u-boot image in NOR memory, and one in NAND - see [[Booting the Neo FreeRunner]] for more information)
| 
  grep  Bootloader /dev/mtdblock0  (yields the NOR u-boot version)
or
  grep  Bootloader /dev/mtdblock1  (yields the NAND u-boot version)
|}

=== I'm unable to flash FreeRunner after booting either into NAND or NOR. ===

'''A:''' {{note|Please check [[Getting_Started_with_your_Neo_FreeRunner]] for more information about flashing new images to your phone.}}
 
=== I can SSH into the phone via USB as per the wiki instructions, but dfu-util does not find the phone. ===

'''A:''' In brief, you need to restart (or power on) the phone to get to the NOR u-boot menu before dfu-util will be able to connect. dfu-util uses the USB DFU (Universal Serial Bus Device Firmware Upgrade) protocol, which is only available at the u-boot menu, and '''not''' Ethernet over USB, which is what is available when the phone has booted fully. 

Tip: If you're just trying out different distributions, you don't need to flash them with dfu-util; you can try out new distributions by putting them on the microSD card and booting from the card instead. If you'd like to do this instead of flashing, see [[Booting from SD]].

To get the u-boot menu:
# Press and hold the AUX button 
# Press the Power button until the phone powers on and displays the boot menu
# Release both buttons 
# Press and release AUX to move the lightbar, so that the menu will not time out and boot the phone).

== Battery ==

=== What is the expected battery life? ===
See [[Neo FreeRunner (GTA02) Battery#Notes_about_expected_battery_life]] and more battery information in [[Neo_FreeRunner_(GTA02)_Battery]]

=== How do I enable fast charge mode for anything but the official mains charger? ===
See [[Forcing fast charge mode]].

== USB ==
=== How do I connect a USB memory-stick etc? ===

'''A:''' This requires an adapter Mini-B 5-pole => Type A jack or an adapter jack => jack. See [[Host Mode]] for more information.

=== Q:''' Once I have such an adapter, can I use it to connect 2 Neos to each other?

'''A:''' This question is equivalent to '''How to connect two [Unix/Linux] computers via USB cable and what sort of special cable is needed?''' -> http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-general-1/connecting-two-computers-with-a-usb-cable-data-cable-411073
<br >
It should work if one Neo is set to Host mode and the other one set to Device mode. One Neo could give power to the USB-port it the other Neo's battery is low. ''(I have to verify this)''

== GSM ==

=== SIM compatibility ===
'''Q:'''Sim card is not working, how do I run diagnostics?

'''A:'''
Here is the "how to" check.

Follow [[Manually_using_GSM]] until you get an OK prompt. More detalied documenation please refer [[FreeRunner_unable_to_work_with_3G_SIM_cards]] and [[Carriers]].

== GPS ==

=== How do I get the GPS working? ===

'''A: '''See [[GTA02 GPS]]

=== It takes a long time (10min+) before the Freerunner gets the first GPS data/readings ===

'''A: '''See [[GPS Problems]].

== Wi-Fi ==

== Sysfs function==

'''Q: How do I get low level hardware related function, like power up device, dump register? '''

'''A: ''' See [[GTA02_sysfs]]

== Display ==

=== Can it play VGA video? ===

No, it can do about 20 fps QVGA with software, and something beetween QVGA and VGA playing MPEG-4 using hardware (at resonable fps). Scaling is also done with GPU hardware.

=== How to change the background picture of the root window? ===

Look [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Today/2007.2#Adjust_UI_components_at_runtime here].

== Software ==

=== Does it support Java? ===
There is a [https://wiki.evolvis.org/jalimo/index.php/Openmoko port of Jalimo] for Openmoko.

=== Does it support Flash? So can I watch YouTube? ===

=== Does it support Ruby ===

Ruby 1.9 please refer http://blog.sparkymat.net/2008/08/10/ruby-19-on-openmoko/
Ruby 1.8.6 please refer http://blog.wolfman.com/articles/2008/08/10/ruby-1-8-6-on-openmoko-freerunner

=== How can I type a '/' in the software keyboard? ===

See [[Switching Keyboards]]

=== How do I get a qwerty software keyboard?===

See [[Switching Keyboards]]

===How to use an external USB or Bluetooth keyboard with the FreeRunner ? ===

just run:
 echo "host" > /sys/devices/platform/s3c2410-ohci/usb_mode
 echo "1" > /sys/devices/platform/neo1973-pm-host.0/hostmode

This'll put the Freerunner in to powered USB host mode, then just plug in the keyboard and it'll work. Personally I've made a .desktop file to switch into and out of host mode. To switch back to unpowered device mode just run:

 echo "device" > /sys/devices/platform/s3c2410-ohci/usb_mode
 echo "0" > /sys/devices/platform/neo1973-pm-host.0/hostmode
