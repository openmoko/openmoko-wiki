== FreeRunner (GTA02): known hardware-related issues ==

There is a collection of known FreeRunner hardware issues at the wiki page [[Freerunner_Hardware_Issues]]; reading that page could help you quickly solve those issues.

==Booting==
'''Q: I can't boot Neo with charger?'''  

'''A:'''
1. You can't boot GTA02 without a spare battery. You should boot Neo with spare battery and attach your charger, then you can boot into neo.

2. Once your phone is booted, remove the spare battery. Freerunner will remain running, 

3. Insert dead battery and let it charge.

'''Q: Unable to flash FreeRunner after booting either into NAND or NOR.'''
'''A:''' {{note|Please check [[Getting_Started_with_your_Neo_FreeRunner]] for more information about the flashing image.}}
 
'''Q: I can ssh into the phone via USB per the wiki instructions, but dfu-util does not find the phone. '''  

'''A:'''
This is what I need to run as root and the everything works fine:
 root(eno,freerunner)# cat upom
 #!/bin/sh
 /sbin/ifconfig usb0 192.168.0.200 netmask 255.255.255.0
 /sbin/route add -host 192.168.0.202/32 dev usb0

'''Q: What image version is used?''' 

'''A:'''

1. Kernel version using: uname -a

2. Root filesystem using: cat /etc/version or cat /etc/om-version

3. u-boot using: grep  Bootloader /dev/mtdblock0

== Battery ==
=== What is the expected battery life? ===
See [[Neo FreeRunner (GTA02) Battery#Notes_about_expected_battery_life]] and more battery information in [[Neo_FreeRunner_(GTA02)_Battery]]
=== How do I enable fast charge mode for anything but the official mains charger? ===
See [[Forcing fast charge mode]]. 

== USB ==
'''Q:''' How do I connect an USB memory-stick etc?

'''A:''' This requires an adapter Mini-B 5-pole => Type A jack or an adapter jack => jack. [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Host_Mode see here]

'''Q:''' Once I have such an adapter, can I use it to connect 2 Neo to each other?

'''A:''' This question is equivalent to '''How to connect two [Unix/Linux] computers via USB cable and what sort of special cable is needed?''' -> http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-general-1/connecting-two-computers-with-a-usb-cable-data-cable-411073
<br >
It should work if one Neo is set to Host mode and the other one set to Device mode. One Neo could give power to the USB-port it the other Neo's battery is low. ''(I have to verify this)''

== GSM ==

=== SIM compatibility ===
'''Q:'''Sim card is not working, how do I run diagnostics?

'''A:'''
Here is the "how to" check.

Follow [[Manually_using_GSM]] until you get an OK prompt. More detalied documenation please refer [[FreeRunner_unable_to_work_with_3G_SIM_cards]] and [[Carriers]].

== GPS ==

'''Q: How do I get the GPS working?''' 

'''A: '''See [[GTA02 GPS]]

'''Q''': it takes a long time (10min+) before the Freerunner gets first GPS data 

'''A: '''See [[GPS Problems]].

== Sysfs function==

'''Q: How do I get low level hardware related function, like power up device, dump register? '''

'''A: ''' See [[GTA02_sysfs]]

== Display ==

=== Can it play VGA video? ===

No, it can do about 20 fps QVGA with software, and something beetween QVGA and VGA playing MPEG-4 using hardware (at resonable fps). Scaling is also done with GPU hardware.

=== How to change the background picture of the root window? ===

Look [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Today/2007.2#Adjust_UI_components_at_runtime here].

== Software ==

=== Does it support Java? ===
There is a [https://wiki.evolvis.org/jalimo/index.php/Openmoko port of Jalimo] for Openmoko.

=== Does it support Flash? So can I watch YouTube? ===

=== Does it support Ruby ===

Ruby 1.9 please refer http://blog.sparkymat.net/2008/08/10/ruby-19-on-openmoko/
Ruby 1.8.6 please refer http://blog.wolfman.com/articles/2008/08/10/ruby-1-8-6-on-openmoko-freerunner

=== How can I type a '/' in the software keyboard? ===

See [[Switching Keyboards]]

=== How do I get a qwerty software keyboard?===

See [[Switching Keyboards]]

===How to use an external USB or Bluetooth keyboard with the FreeRunner ? ===

just run:
 echo "host" > /sys/devices/platform/s3c2410-ohci/usb_mode
 echo "1" > /sys/devices/platform/neo1973-pm-host.0/hostmode

This'll put the Freerunner in to powered USB host mode, then just plug in the keyboard and it'll work. Personally I've made a .desktop file to switch into and out of host mode. To switch back to unpowered device mode just run:

 echo "device" > /sys/devices/platform/s3c2410-ohci/usb_mode
 echo "0" > /sys/devices/platform/neo1973-pm-host.0/hostmode
