The [[Neo1973 Hardware | Neo1973]] is the first phone designed to run [[OpenMoko]].
It is a phone that can be used with any [[GSM]] operator, and it is manufactured by [[FIC]] who instigated the [[OpenMoko]] project.

If you just received a Neo1973 here are some suggestions for [[Getting_Started_with_your_Neo1973 | getting started]].

[[Neo1973 Hardware | Neo1973 Hardware]] and [[Disassembling Neo1973]] have more information on the hardware.

See [[OpenMoko]], [[OpenMokoFramework]], [[MokoMakefile]] and [[Development resources]] for more information about source code.

See [[FAQ]] for other Frequently Asked Questions.

There is some SVG [[ClipArt]] for simple illustrative purposes.

See [[Neo1973_Hardware#GTA01Bv4|Neo1973 Hardware]] for what components GTA01B_v04 contains.

Neo Base -- everything the mobile application developer needs to enjoy
the benefits of the first freed phone, the Neo1973:

 * Neo1973 (GTA01B_v4)
 * Battery (1200mAh)
 * Stylus
 * Headset
 * Phone Pouch
 * Lanyard
 * SanDisk 512MB MicroSD Card
 * Mini USB Connectivity Cable

Neo Advanced -- everything the mobile device hacker wants to get down
and dirty with the first freed phone, the Neo1973:

 * Neo1973 (GTA01B_v4)
 * Battery (1200mAh) (2x)
 * Stylus
 * Headset
 * Phone Pouch
 * Lanyard
 * SanDisk 512MB MicroSD Card (2x)
 * Mini USB Connectivity Cable (2x)
 * Debug Flex Cable
 * Debug Board v2 (JTAG and serial console)

You do not need the Advanced package to do normal kernel, or application development, only perhaps hacking on [[u-boot]].
