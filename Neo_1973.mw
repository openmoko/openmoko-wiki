    Around 2007-03-25 Phase 1: Official Developer Launch
    We will sell the Neo1973 direct from openmoko.com for US$350 plus
    shipping. Sales and orders will be worldwide. We are specifically
    targeting open source community developers.

    A few weeks after this, more announcements will be made as to the roadmap for future devices.
    
    2007-09-11 Phase 2: Mass Market Sale
    This will have a faster CPU, and 'something else everyone has been 
    asking for' [[Introduction#Videos]] (30:20)
    Which is presumably either a camera or wifi. 
    Online sales will continue. We will also be available in a retail
    stores and selected carriers around the world. At this point, we
    hope your mom and dad will want to buy a Neo1973, too.

    The 2nd generation OpenMoko device will also be introduced at this
    time. We have something special in the works, but again, you will
    help shape this device.
