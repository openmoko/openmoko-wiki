= Availability =

* [[Wishlist:Neo1973_P0_Review|Phase 0]]: 36 developers have received their devices.

* Phase 1: In late March is the Official Developer Launch. Join the announce mailing list to be notified when it's available.
**Order the Neo1973 direct from openmoko.com for US$350 plus shipping. Sales and orders will be worldwide. We are specifically targeting open source community developers. 
**At this time the phone will be a working touchscreen phone, but little more. It depends on you and the rest of the community to polish it into a fully usable device.

** A few weeks after this, announcements will be made of the roadmap to future devices.
** Between this time and mass market release, the hardware will update with a faster CPU and "something else everyone has been asking for". (Said at 30:20 in the [[Introduction#Videos|FOSDEM video]].) Which is presumably either a camera or wifi. 
* Phase 2: September 11, Mass Market Sale.
**Online sales will continue. 
**We will also be available in a retail stores and from selected carriers around the world. 
**At this point, we hope your Mom and Dad will want to buy a Neo1973, too.

*The 2nd generation OpenMoko device will be introduced at this time. We have something special in the works, but again, you will help shape this device.
