== Dynamic Screen Orientation ==

Using an [[accelerometer]] to sense which direction is down, the interface could switch between portrait and landscape display modes, and possibly even upside down modes for a total of 4 screen orientations.

This orientation should also be used when capturing images or videos in either landscape or portrait mode. This eliminated the need for tedious rotation correction for captures images and movies. For images this orientation should also be stored in EXIF tags.
