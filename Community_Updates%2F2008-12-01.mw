Dear friends,

Good evening/day/afternoon (whatever your TZ is). This is our sixth "community community update".
Congratulations to Val√©rio, he won the first 24h-coding prize at Sapo Codebits by turning [http://www.valeriovalerio.org/?p=187 freerunner in a mouse and gamepad] using the accelerometers. Code will be merged with [[ReMoko]]. Another month goes by without a 2008.x release, but Openmoko's optimization team invites volunteers to install the latest testing image and report. And we have lots of newer applications.

== Applications ==

* A new [http://scalde.free.fr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=93:pong-pogresses&amp;catid=43:openmoko&amp;Itemid=66 Pong] game.
* [http://blog.1407.org/2008/11/19/openmoko-newrotate-050-lazy-edition-is-out/ Newrotate 0.5] is out, uses really little CPU now.
* [[Gtkaddpoi]] 0.5 : software to add a Point Of Interest to TangoGPS.

* ShortOm 0.2 : an application/shell launcher.
* openmoko-panel-plugin 0.6 : support for fso frameworkd milestone 4.
* [[Unison]] works. It is a file-synchronization tool for Unix and Windows. It determines all differences between two directory trees and lets the user decide, how to proceed with every differing file.
* [http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~taw27/openmoko/openmoocow/ OpenMooCow] 0.2. Mooes more, runs headless, tickleable.

== Distributions ==

* SHR: a [http://lists.openmoko.org/nabble.html#nabble-td1576966 newer snapshot] is available.
* ASU: The [http://downloads.openmoko.org/releases/ official 2008.9 image] is back online without the questionable audio codecs. This month's 2008.11 is not going to see the light, but here are instructions to [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-November/036694.html install the current 2008.testing build]. It has all the goodies from  optimization team (read their [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-November/036276.html progress report], [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-November/035769.html previous reports]), i.e. about 1 minute boot and [http://git.openmoko.org/?p=qtopia.git;a=commit;h=eb855af76018bedf6a89b9ac736d2ffa3961932b Volume control] during call...  The bug count is decreasing in the latest [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/devel/2008-November/003493.html testing report]. See also the [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/devel/2008-November/003312.html previous testing report] hardware revision A7 with capacitor was declared good for m<i>e</i>ss production ;). 
*  For [[Android]]: Walter Chang [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-November/036054.html made a soft keyboard]. Rui Castro implemented an [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-November/036564.html OnScreen Keyboard]. It was immediately included in Sean's image, to be released at [[User:Seanmcneil3|the usual page]] without mp3 support soon. Koolu posted an [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-December/036759.html update on their release plans]: they too are busy dealing with the audio codecs IP issue.
* Following a post on the French wiki, the [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Distributions#Hackable:1 Distribution] page was updated by adding FIVE new distros: Hackable:1, NeoPwn, RunningBear, Poky and PyNeo.

== Hardware ==

* For an armband to hold the Freerunner while exercising, Gilles Casse recommends the [http://www.caselogic.com/universal_mp3_sport_case_large/product_detail/index.cfm?modelid=120544 UMC-3] from Case Logic.
* Patrick Beck grafted a light on a miniusb - connector, to make an [http://yourse.de/wiki/doku.php?id=openmoko:usb_light OpenMoko flash light]. More lumens the bright white screen one get with the [http://projects.openmoko.org/projects/flashlight/ Flashlight] script.
* The [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-November/036132.html official fix] for buzzing is to add a 100uF capacity here and replace one resistor there. Technical details to be published in an Openmoko rework SOP paper. The company is looking at how to fix *all* devices sold.
* The Calypso GSM firmware moko10 was released, it fixes {{ticket|666}} for those users with 3G SIM cards. A few Indiana Jones types did try and follow [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/GSM/Flashing the wiki instructions] to reflash, most with success, some with hubris (def: <i>excessive pride</i>). For the rest of us, a user-friendly installer is being prepared.

== Kernel and bootloaders ==

Big bad bug of the month prize goes to {{ticket|1841}} white screen of death (WSOD) after resume. This bug shows itself only by cold weather! Nicolas Dufresne found out that the culprit was probably a too tight timing in the JBT driver. Hopefully this will be fixed soon now, and we can all switch to Linux 2.6.28 happily everafter. Developers must read [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-November/036142.html Andy's explanations] about kernel branch management.

* Preview upcoming [http://lists.openmoko.org/nabble.html#nabble-td1569863 changes to the /sys] directory.
* Improvements to the touchscreen, backlight and accelerometer kernel drivers.
* [[Qi]] gets lots of GTA03 love, audio back and a memory test ability (called when there are no valid kernels).
* The opkg package manager was patched to cache downloaded files.

==Community==
* Removed the tagcloud extension that messed up with page formatting.
* There are many links to nice [[Ringtones]] on the wiki, but the page and the whole topic need a good overhaul.
* GnuPhone here we come: Sten Kvamme explains how to [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/devel/2008-November/003318.html make a call from the command line] (on FSO).
* For your pleasure, here is the OpenMoko [[Jokes]] page. Thanks to the community, keep them coming ;) We (Coolcat and I) are also thinking about adding a pic of the week to the homepage, so stay tuned.
* Courtesy of Dale Maggee, [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-November/036053.html here] and [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-November/036142.html here] are a few funny splash screens. Note that you already trust Dale if you are using ''neotool'' to flash your Neo.
* A few brave souls signed up to start a 3D driver for Glamo.
