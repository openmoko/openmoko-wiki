{{Languages|Successful Use Cases}}

This page is intended to collect all of the successful use cases people have managed to make work with their freerunners.   The goal is to both provide examples of the kinds of interesting things people are doing, but also to provide info on how others can make use of the same use case.

If you've been using your FR successfully for something not listed below - please copy the template block at the bottom and fill it in with details like what Distro and software you used, and any interesting setup steps.

__TOC__

=== PDF Reader ===

I use the FR as a PDF reader when I'm away from my laptop, or in a situation where I can't easily use a laptop, such as walking, standing up on a bus or metro, etc.

Distro:  OM2009 TR5 - but should work on any X based distro

Software: [[Epdfview]] - make sure that you have the recent version with a way to get out of fullscreen mode, and a way to switch pages in fullscreen mode.

The process I use is to just scp the pdfs into a 'doc' directory on the FR, and leave the edpfview open dialog on that folder.   Scrolling through the files is a little annoying, but it works passably well.  some kind of a 'bookshelf' program that would display the list of PDFs in a better way and launch epdfview on each would be a great addition.
