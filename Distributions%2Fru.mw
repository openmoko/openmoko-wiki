Openmoko distributions are designed to run on various mobile devices, with the primary aim of Openmoko Inc.'s Neo 1973 and Neo FreeRunner phones. They are similar to Linux distributions; complete operating systems with user applications. You can install any of them on your phone or even have a multiboot system with two distributions installed.

While the Openmoko distributions will run on other mobile devices too, some other software distributions will also run on the Openmoko Inc. phones (see below).

For downloads see Latest Images, for installation instructions see Flashing the Neo FreeRunner.
