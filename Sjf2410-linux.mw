== General ==
You can use this as one method to un-brick your [[Neo1973]], in case your bootloader has been corrupted.

sjf2410-linux is a linux-enabled version of the sjf2410 tool.  

It allows you to use a [[wiggler]] compatible JTAG Probe to program NAND and NOR flash attached to the S3C2410 (In the [[Neo1973]], we only use NAND flash).

== Object Code ==
The latest release can be found at https://buildhost.openmoko.org/tmp/gta01/deploy/images/sjf2410

== Source Code ==
The current sources are kept in https://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/src/host/sjf2410-linux/

== Usage ==

=== To flash a u-boot image into NAND flash ===

basically you have to start the program with option '-f' to specify the file you want to flash.

Then, verify that it actually detects the S3C2419 CPU.

In the Main Menu, select '0' for 'K9S1208 prog'. In the prog menu, select '0' for 'K9S1208 Program' and then '0' as the block number.

==== Example ====
<pre>
$ sjf2410 -f ~/u-boot_nand-gta01bv2-20070104112711.bin
