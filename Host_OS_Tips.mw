With a variety of linux distributions come a myriad of differences. Below are some quirks you may find when building, flashing or talking to your Neo1973 

== OpenSuSE 10.2 ==


=== u-boot ===

When booting the Neo1973 in u-boot mode '''/dev/ttyACM0''' may not appear automatically. You may have to:

 # modprobe cdc_acm

before hand. Conversely cdc_ether seems to work automatically without any issues.

== VNC ==

Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a graphical desktop sharing system which uses the RFB protocol to remotely control another computer. It transmits the keyboard and mouse events from one computer to another, relaying the graphical screen updates back in the other direction, over a network. (source: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing Wikipedia])

Install a VNC server on the FR

 # opkg install x11vnc

Create a launcher icon on the desktop like this:

 echo -e "[Desktop Entry]\n\
 Encoding=UTF-8\n\
 Name=x11vnc\n\
 Comment=Bring up x11vnc\n\
 Exec=xterm -e x11vnc -display :0.0 -ncache 10\n\
 Icon=x11vnc\n\
 Terminal=false\n\
 Type=Application\n\
 Categories=Application;Utilities;\n\
 SingleInstance=true\n\
 StartupNotify=true" > /usr/share/applications/x11vnc.desktop 


One can now fully control the FR from the desktop by launching

 $ vncviewer 192.168.0.202:0

It even accepts keyboard input, for example in the dialer, or any other control using the desktop mouse as the styler; this way it's also very easy to make screenshots for presentation, or even capture a session in a movie with:

 $ vnc2swf openmoko.swf 192.168.0.202:0
