The following script can be used to make the Neo FreeRunner act as a mass storage device (memory stick, USB key, portable drive...)

 #!/bin/sh                                                                                                                                                                   
 /etc/init.d/networking stop
 rmmod g_ether
 modprobe g_file_storage file=/dev/mmcblk0p1
