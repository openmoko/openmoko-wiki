Q: How to make the Neo FreeRunner act as a mass storage device (memory stick, USB key, portable drive...)

A: The following script can be used
 #!/bin/sh                                                                                                                                                                   
 ifdown usb0
 rmmod g_ether
 modprobe g_file_storage file=/dev/mmcblk0p1

Q: Is it possible to pretend to be a USB hub, providing both g_ether and g_file_storage ?

A: Not yet. At the moment it's one gadget driver at a time, but there is a project under way to allow use of multiple gadget drivers together.
