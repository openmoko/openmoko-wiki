==Make the Neo FreeRunner act as a mass storage device==

To access the microSD card in the Freerunner from the host computer as if it were a USB key or memory stick, the following script can be used:

 #!/bin/sh
 ifdown usb0
 umount /media/card
 rmmod g_ether
 modprobe g_file_storage file=/dev/mmcblk0p1
Reference: [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-September/029261.html Petr Vanek's "usb mass media storage" message on the community mailing list]

The card is not accessible from the Freerunner in this mode.

==Make the Neo FreeRunner revert to USB networking==

The following script can be used:

 #!/bin/sh
 rmmod g_file_storage
 mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /media/card
 modprobe g_ether
 ifup usb0
Be sure to properly unmount on the host computer first, just as you would with any other USB storage.

==Is it possible to pretend to be a USB hub, providing both g_ether and g_file_storage?==

Not yet. At the moment it's one gadget driver at a time, but there is a project under way to allow use of multiple gadget drivers together.
