[http://wiki.maemo.org/Mer/ '''Mer'''] is a [[Distributions|distribution]] based on  [http://wiki.maemo.org Maemo]

Mer is being ported to Freerunner, thanks to the support of [http://www.eshopen.com Eshopen] distributor of OpenMoko in Italy, by Vincenzo Ampolo (goshawk) and Carsten M. Munk (Stskeep).

Installing to sd-card.
 Empty sd card.

 Empty sd card.

 Use ssh and tar to decompress the file, run in your computer:
 cat mer-armel-freerunner-rootfs-v0.15.tar | ssh root@192.168.0.202 "cd /mnt/card ; tar xvf -"


You need [[Qi | qi-boot menu]] installed. Then just turn phone on. First boot takes time. It shows error/warning about missing BOOT, but it is booting! When it ask username and password click text field and you will get on-screen-keyboard. Then it restart X and you are in.

'''Usage'''

Press mer-text on upper left corner to application menu (there are only xterm in utilities).

It is Ubuntu, so you are normal user in admin group. Use sudo and your user password to maintenance.

WiFi are not working. It doesn't have ifconfig. Usb-networking(usb0) might work with 192.168.2.14 (as desktop) and 192.168.2.15 (as freerunner) in your connect-script. You can change this at /etc/network/interfaces. 
The default root-passwd should be "rootme". 

The only way to shutdown might be removing battery or type "sudo shutdown -h xx:xx" in X Terminal. (2009/08/07) 
A Simple "halt" worked as root over ssh (for me).

You can read the [http://wiki.maemo.org/Mer/Hardware/Freerunner Mer wiki page about Freerunner] for up-to-date info


A lot of work is still to be done. Developers are now focused on the creation of a usable keyboard and porting the FSO framework in Mer.
