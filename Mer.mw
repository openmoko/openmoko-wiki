You need [[Qi | qi-boot menu]] installed. Then just turn phone on. First boot takes time. It shows error/warning about missing BOOT, but it is booting! When it ask username and password click text field and you will get on-screen-keyboard. Then it restart X and you are in.

'''Usage'''

Press mer-text on upper left corner to application menu (there are only xterm in utilities).

It is Ubuntu, so you are normal user in admin group. Use sudo and your user password to maintenance.

WiFi are not working. It doesn't have ifconfig. Usb-networking might work (who confirms this?). Only way to shutdown is removing battery. (2009/07/23)
