=== Comments on models ===
All the samples comes with a not EU  wall socket so I have to test them with the Neo wall charger
==== SC018 ====
Don't even able to charge the neo shotted down or suspended

==== SC019 ====
in spite specifications claims 3000mA it can only charge the 1200mA Neo batterie once and the second try it only charge 1/3 , and it takes more than 4h to do the full charge in spite of Neo detect it as 1000mA/h power source, and neo must be suspended or no charge, only mantains the internal battery at same level if Neo is on.

==== SC020 ====
Instruction only in Chinese and the lack of compatible wall socket make me unable to test it cause it not use a mini USB and I have no adaptors aviable.

== Solar Gorilla ==

The product 'Solar Gorilla' is a polycristalline foldable module. I've used it for a XO computer (with a converter) and now for my FreeRunner (without). It has a USB output which delivers enough electricity. The FR doesn't need to be forced to 500mA. The module has an output of 10W, which is more than enough. Unfold, I can attach it to my bicycle. I also use a small lectern to hold it on a table.
