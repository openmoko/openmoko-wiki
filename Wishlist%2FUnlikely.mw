These are ideas that are unlikely to be implemented in the neo1973. Some are impossible for any device, 
some may be possible if technology improves in the future, when patents expire, or in othere models.

== Different Shapes & Styles ==
The current shape is great and many people love it (and I myself plan on getting one).  Still, different strokes for different folks & we're allowed to muse about other options.

===Dump the '''''egg-shaped''''' case design and go '''''rectangular''''' for more screen space===
*I'm all for devices that look great and have great features - aside from that I really like the current design. Thus I'd like to comment that the design change request is probably not the majority's opinion. [[User:Abraxa|Abraxa]] 00:00, 18 February 2007 (CET)

There will be many OpenMoko devices, of different designs. --[[User:Speedevil|Speedevil]] 06:19, 28 February 2007 (CET)

===Clamshell===
Nuff said
===Twisting top===
Perfect for a multi-directional camera phone (for easier self photos & video conferencing)<br />
[[Image:Kg920phone.jpg]]<br />


== Storage Devices / Peripherals ==
=== Floppy Disk Drive ===
For people stuck in the past who just can't let go of that last 3 and a half inches.

At least the initial devices will be phones. In a phone this is a bad idea.
There may be future devices that it would be appropriate in.

===LASER keyboard (can be a full QWERTY keyboard)===
*On the hardware side, this would require a $5 laser diode, a $3 (in bulk) custom diffraction grating, and probably a couple of cubic centimetres volume inside the phone.
*This requires a camera pointable to the front.
*It requires an integrated stand for the phone.
*To practically use this, you've got to be 40cm or so away from the phone, which means under 25*20 of text resolution.
*In software, it's relatively easy to parse the camera output, to find changes in the known laser field.

There are major problems. 
*Patent issues. 
*No tactile response at all, which slows typing.
*An extra 2cc/6g.

There are existing Bluetooth devices that do this. [http://www.thinkgeek.com/computing/input/8193/ For example, this one from thinkgeek]. --[[User:Alx|Alx]] 02:28, 29 March 2007 (CEST)


==Power Sources==
===V12 Embedded power source===

We'll need something beefy to power the next Neos for the above gadgets, I propose the use of a [http://www.ultimatestupidity.com/pics/1/diesel/ Embeddable Power Source], that with some miniturisation and a bit of design work should be workable as a possible solution.

=== Flux Capacitor ===
The device needs a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux_capacitor flux capacitor] instead of a battery ;)

=== Power over WiFi ===
Using PoWiFi openmoko-devices could be powered by your pc-wifi-card or wifi-router. 
Charge your mobile at every wlan-ap with no plug-in required.

Another implementation might be power-over-bluetooth.


== Miscellaneous ==
=== Disinfection UV-Light ===
I had read about it in an Article on http://www.americanairandwater.com/UV-news/. But Motorola patents it.
Yes - finally a way to stop the billions of annual deaths due to cellphone infections! --[[User:Speedevil|Speedevil]] 14:04, 16 February 2007 (CET)
It´s just something that flying in my head... It´s not the first "unreal" or "useless" idea. Just for fun! --[[User:MookiE|MookiE]] 14:51, 16 February 2007 (CET)

More seriously - UV of the required frequency is inherently eye-damaging.
Also, as I understand it, there are actually no UV LEDs that will reliably produce 'germicidal' UV.
The most expensive - and they are very expensive - ones produce UV of a sort that may kill very susceptible bacteria, but comparatively few.
IIRC the LEDs are $20 per.

=== Teleportation ===
Implementing a beaming-device to the Neo would make it the first phone enabling teleportation.
See: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3811785.stm]
Possible implementation difficulties might be the lacking teleportation-support in the GSM standard as well as uncooperative mobile service providers that feel uneasy towards innovative technologies...
''

(Please get serious. You would obviously need more bandwidth to make this practical. Wifi would be better or at least 3G. maybe you could use Bluetooth with the right compression algorithms.)''

=== All band compatibility ===

*Is it possible to make the phone so it can work on any cell network including the Veriz** network in the USA. Unfortunately, the FCC has allowed network providers to have proprietary phones etc... The way the US system works tends to cheapen the phone itself because there is more money in the selling of service, this tends to foster semi-disposable phones. Don't loose focus, you are in business to  make money selling phones, make really good solid phones and they will be appreciated. My ideal is to be able to go purchase a phone, purchase a service separately, and be able to change services when necessary.  

** Unfortunately, this would add significant cost, volume, and weight. And be useless for the majority of worldwide users. In some carriers cases, you simply can't do this anyway, as they won't supply information on their networks, or let you connect to them with your own handset. Different phones for different markets is probably the way to go. Hopefully eventually the carriers will bring out OpenMoko phones.

== Beverage Aids ==
===Alcohol Sensor===
Alcohol sensor adjacent to microphone.  It doesn't have to be accurate, just has to detect any amount of alcohol on the speaker's breath.  I understand this is a very narrow market, but alcohol is on every parent's mind.

I think those who drive cars might profit from this feature too. --[[User:Cedel|cedel]] 16:02, 20 February 2007 (CET)

:Although this is a good idea, you have to be very careful about liability here. If it gives a false positive (i.e. you're not over the limit), and you have an accident, the OpenMoko team might be liable.

===Bottle opener===
* including a bottle opener is very hard, but could be useful.
* [http://www.bokonzept.de/php/images/462.jpg example]
* It definitely is useful. A metal reinforced corner might be enough. While it is possible to open bottles with most cell phones, they don't look too good after opening a few cases.


==Hardware enhancements==

Some small hardware enhancement could be cheap, but very useful. Please add your ideas/wishes here:
<br \>


'''Made Hardware Extension/Expansion for the Base Product'''<br \>
Market this device like a fully customizable PC;<br \>
- create a base device, (which you already did)<br \> 
- add wifi and bluetooth(absolutely neccesary for any mobile device)<br \>
- make expansion hardware, that user can connect to the base hardware, (e.g camera & hdd; gamepad...etc)<br \>
- just like a PC the user will choose customizations that sue their needs.<br \>
- most important, the expansion hardware should NOT be a peripheral that has ridiculously long cables, it should fit snuggly to the device making it a little thicker than the base device.<br \>
- This mobile entertainment generation wants an all-in-one device. They want their cellphone, mp3 player, pda, digital camera(which takes good quality and sized pictures), video player to all fit in their pocket.<br \>
- That's why the ipod's hot, but that is why this is hotter, the user can get all those things and upload software to make it better it even better to their personalities.<br \>

If the hardware is made as customizable as the software, everyone will have one of these device, from the smallest child to a CEO of a corporation, because it can be made exactly to what the user wants. Market the expansion hardware, no-one will mind paying for the parts as they need them, but they will be very upset about not being able to do want they really want to do with it. No one will even think about looking at other devices. If the "regular joe/jill"  has to buy a new part instead of a whole new device, which do you think he/she will choose?

- Modular, able to open and upgrade/add hardware while keeping a micro form factor.
----

The neo1973 is a phone, to be marketed as a phone. Future devices may be marketed in other ways. The shape and number of buttons is fixed for this device. Minor modifications may happen before it ships in September.

See [[Expansion Back]] for expansion thoughts. Extendable devices otherwise simply aren't really possible, unless you make the phone larger than needed.

The connectors take up volume, add unreliability, need mechanical fixings, and modules have to be larger than required to allow slight increases in size. --[[User:Speedevil|Speedevil]] 14:47, 17 April 2007 (CEST)
