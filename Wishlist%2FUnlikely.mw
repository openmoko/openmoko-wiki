These are ideas that are unlikely to be implementable in the near term, or indeed ever in a phone.
Some of them may be possible if technology improves in the future, or when patents expire.

=====LASER keyboard (can be a full QWERTY keyboard)=====
*On the hardware side, this would require a $5 laser diode, a $3 (in bulk) custom diffraction grating, and probably a couple of cubic centimetres volume inside the phone.
*This requires a camera pointable to the front.
*It requires an integrated stand for the phone.
*To practically use this, you've got to be 40cm or so away from the phone, which means under 25*20 of text resolution.
*In software, it's relatively easy to parse the camera output, to find changes in the known laser field.

There are major problems. 
*Patent issues. 
*No tactile response at all, which slows typing.
*An extra 2cc/6g.

=====Alcohol Sensor=====
Alcohol sensor adjacent to microphone.  It doesn't have to be accurate, just has to detect any amount of alcohol on the speaker's breath.  I understand this is a very narrow market, but alcohol is on every parent's mind.

I think those who drive cars might profit from this feature too. --[[User:Cedel|cedel]] 16:02, 20 February 2007 (CET)

=====Disinfection UV-Light=====
I had read about it in an Article on http://www.americanairandwater.com/UV-news/. But Motorola patents it.
Yes - finally a way to stop the billions of annual deaths due to cellphone infections! --[[User:Speedevil|Speedevil]] 14:04, 16 February 2007 (CET)
It´s just something that flying in my head... It´s not the first "unreal" or "useless" idea. Just for fun! --[[User:MookiE|MookiE]] 14:51, 16 February 2007 (CET)

More seriously - UV of the required frequency is inherently eye-damaging.
Also, as I understand it, there are actually no UV LEDs that will reliably produce 'germicidal' UV.
The most expensive - and they are very expensive - ones produce UV of a sort that may kill very susceptible bacteria, but comparatively few.
IIRC the LEDs are $20 per.

=====Teleportation=====
Implementing a beaming-device to the Neo would make it the first phone enabling teleportation.
See: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3811785.stm]
Possible implementation difficulties might be the lacking teleportation-support in the GSM standard as well as uncooperative mobile service providers that feel uneasy towards innovative technologies...
''

(Please get serious. You would obviously need more bandwidth to make this practical. Wifi would be better or at least 3G. maybe you could use Bluetooth with the right compression algorithms.)''

=====V12 Embedded power source=====

We'll need something beefy to power the next Neos for the above gadgets, I propose the use of a [http://www.ultimatestupidity.com/pics/1/diesel/ Embeddable Power Source], that with some miniturisation and a bit of design work should be workable as a possible solution.

=====PCMCIA slot=====
Extensibility would be nice. Standard pcmcia would be great for allowing wireless too. And pcmcia cards tend to be very low power.
*1. can be used for a spare battery (is this possible?)
*3. i can use my [http://www.echoaudio.com/Products/CardBus/IndigoIO/index.php Echo Audio Indigo I/O]
*2. can be used for different cards around

This is certain not to happen in a production phone, it's simply far too large, and requires complex support in hardware, which does not exist in most system on a chip devices as are used in phones. 
Even for the [[Expansion_Back]] it would be too large. --[[User:Speedevil|Speedevil]] 06:05, 28 February 2007 (CET)

=====Dump the '''''egg-shaped''''' case design and go '''''rectangular''''' for more screen space=====
*I'm all for devices that look great and have great features - aside from that I really like the current design. Thus I'd like to comment that the design change request is probably not the majority's opinion. [[User:Abraxa|Abraxa]] 00:00, 18 February 2007 (CET)

There will be many OpenMoko devices, of different designs. --[[User:Speedevil|Speedevil]] 06:19, 28 February 2007 (CET)
