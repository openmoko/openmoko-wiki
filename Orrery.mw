The orrery is a simple application for the openmoko platform which displays the night sky.  It is nothing like as elaborate as, for example Google Sky or xephem.   It is intended to be a small application that will have a storage footprint comparable to a ringtone, or one of the games bundled with the
openmoko rootfs.   It requires no network connection, but does use the GPS information, by querying gpsd.<p>
