<p>
The orrery is a simple application for the openmoko platform which displays the night sky. It is nothing like as elaborate as, for example Google Sky or xephem. It is intended to be a small application that will have a storage footprint comparable to a ringtone, or one of the games bundled with the
openmoko rootfs. It requires no network connection, but does use the GPS information, by querying gpsd.<p>
