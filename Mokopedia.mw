Mokopedia intends to make wikipedia accessible on your phone even without being online because all articles will reside bzipped on an SD Card.
It is based on the [[Look_%26_Feel#Native_Stylus-Based | Stylus Demo]] by [[User:Mickey|Mickey]] which one can find in openmoko/trunk/src/target/OM-2007/examples/. Please submit more feature ideas!

==Feature Ideas==
Please feel free to add anything that comes to your mind.
*show articles depending on location (GPS)
*list with
**recently viewed articles (history)
**most viewed articles
*search articles "as you type"
*it will have no pictures - not enough room on any storage media
*tex forumlas could be generated with a local LaTeX install but such may be too big for the phone
*all wikipedia versions except the english one will fit on a 4GB SDCard (tested with the second largest wikipedia (german))
*all articles in one big file and one index file for title searches OR a lot of small gzipped files which get unzipped on the fly
**the gzipped/bzipped version will only take less then a gigabyte and this way even the english wikipedia should fit on a little microsd card
**can anyone confirm if SDHC cards are working with the neo? if not we are capped to 2GB
*new wikipedia versions can be obtained from here [http://download.wikimedia.org/]
*option for varying the text size
*settings dialog
**set articles location
*forward/back buttons
*bookmarks
*support for stripped down wikipedia versions (100MB, 500MB) with only the most viewed articles for users without expensive 4Gig Cards
