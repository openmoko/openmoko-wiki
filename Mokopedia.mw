It would be usefull to access an offline version of wikipedia (since there are people who do not want to pay for mobile internet) on the OpenMoko Platform.
Here is a little tweak I did with the Stylus Demo by [[User:Mickey|Mickey]]. Please submit more feature ideas!

==Feature Ideas==

*show articles depending on location (GPS)
*list with
**recently viewed articles
**most viewed articles
*search articles "as you type"
*it will have no pictures - not enough room on any storage media
*tex forumlas could be generated with a local LaTeX install but such may be too big for the phone
*all wikipedia versions except the english one will fit on a 4GB SDCard (tested with the second largest wikipedia (german))
*all articles in one big file and one index file for title searches OR a lot of small gzipped files which get unzipped on the fly
**the gzipped/bzipped version will only take less then a gigabyte and this way even the english wikipedia should fit on a little microsd card
**can anyone confirm if SDHC cards are working with the neo? if not we are capped to 2GB
*new wikipedia versions can be obtained from here [http://download.wikimedia.org/]
*option for varying the text size
*settings dialog
**set article location
*forward/back buttons
*bookmarks

==Currently Implemented==

*UTF-8 capable article viewer
*several empty user controls
