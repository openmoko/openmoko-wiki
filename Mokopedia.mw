{{todo|Support this project by adding ideas and comments to the discussion page and edit this article}}

Mokopedia makes wikipedia accessible on your openmoko phone even without being online because all articles will reside in a compressed filesystem (squashFS) on your SD Card.

You will have to install lighttpd to access a local perl cgi script with the web browser of your choice. This script will offer you a text box to easily search your stored articles.

==Feature Ideas==
Please feel free to add anything that comes to your mind.
*it will have no pictures - not enough room on any storage media
*tex forumlas could be generated with a local LaTeX install but this may be too big for the phone
*all wikipedia versions except the english one will fit on a 1GB SDCard (tested with the second largest wikipedia (german)) - compressability tests with en-wiki in progress
*
*support for stripped down wikipedia versions (100MB, 500MB)
** Add an option that would schedule article downloads based on previous searches that return no results on the Neo. Could be triggered when the Neo detects a Wifi connection or when it is connected via USB.
** image with X of the most importand article (perhaps mostlinked?) [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Mostlinked Mostlinked]
** image without Lonelypages [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Lonelypages Lonelypages]
** image without Uncategorizedpages [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Uncategorizedpages Uncategorizedpages]
*** squashfs is a read only filesystem - such additional articles would have to be stored elsewhere

==Development Status==

*I finished writing the perl and bash scripts for optimizing your wikipedia html dump. To obtain the dumps goto http://static.wikipedia.org. The scripts are in svn on the mokopedia project site http://projects.openmoko.org/plugins/scmsvn/viewcvs.php/?root=mokopedia
*lighttpd is working on openmoko as a light webserver without too much overhead
*cgi-script for searching and accessing articles is finished and downloadable via the SCM link above
*english wikipedia with ALL ARTICLES is compressible to 3,2GB
*there are to ready to download images of the german wikipedia
** 946MB april 2007 http://www.rabenfrost.net/wikipedia_de_april_mini.img this one will fit on a 1GB microsd card with 953MB real space
** 1,3GB august 2007 http://www.rabenfrost.net/wikipedia_de_august.img full version with, categories, special pages etc..

==Requirements==
===On the target (NEO)===
*lighttpd
*changes in /etc/lighttpd.conf
<pre>enable server-module "mod_cgi", "mod_rewrite", "mod_redirect", "mod_access"</pre>
<pre>#### CGI module
cgi.assign                  = ( ".pl"  => "/usr/bin/perl",
                                ".cgi" => "/usr/bin/perl" )
</pre>
<pre>#### url handling modules (rewrite, redirect, access)
url.rewrite-once        = ( "^/wiki/(.*)"      => "/wiki/mokopedia.cgi?q=$1" )
</pre>
*perl
*perl-module-encode
*perl-module-encode-encoding
*perl-module-bytes
*perl-module-utf8
*perl-module-utf8-heavy
*squashfs-tools (optional)
*kernel-module-squashfs
*kernel-module-loop
*[[Web Browser]]

===On the host===
To build the squashFS image on your PC instead of downloading ready-to-use-images you additionally need mksquashfs-tools

==Credits==
A big thank to the following people:
* kahuna for bringing me back to the idea of mokopedia as served html to a browser of your choice
* fgau for trying out everything I wrote on his neo
* thomasg for suggesting the use of a compressed file system
* Marcel_M for his great repository with squashfs and loop kernel modules http://celtune.morb-design.com/ipk/fic-gta01/
* everyone on #neo1973-germany
All you guys helped me a lot!!
