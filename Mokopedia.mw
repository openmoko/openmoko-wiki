It would be usefull to access an offline version of wikipedia (since there are people who do not want to pay for mobile internet) on the OpenMoko Platform.
Here is a little tweak I did with the Stylus Demo by [[User:Mickey|Mickey]]. Please submit more feature ideas!

==Features==

*show articles depending on location (GPS)
*list with recently viewed articles
*search articles "as you type"
*it will have no pictures - not enough room on any media
*tex forumlas could be generated with a local LaTeX install
*all wikipedia versions except the english one will fit on a 4GB SDCard (tested with the second largest wikipedia (german))
*all articles in one big file and one index file for title searches OR a lot of small gzipped files which get unzipped on the fly
*new wikipedia versions can be obtained from here [http://download.wikimedia.org/]
