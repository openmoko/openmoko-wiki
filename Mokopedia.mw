Mokopedia makes wikipedia accessible on your openmoko phone even without being online because all articles will reside in a compressed filesystem (squashFS) on your SD Card.

You will have to install lighttpd to access a local python script with the web browser of your choice. This script will offer you a text box to easily search your stored articles.

==Feature Ideas==
Please feel free to add anything that comes to your mind.
*it will have no pictures - not enough room on any storage media
*tex forumlas could be generated with a local LaTeX install but this may be too big for the phone
*all wikipedia versions except the english one will fit on a 1GB SDCard (tested with the second largest wikipedia (german)) - compressability tests with en-wiki in progress
*support for stripped down wikipedia versions (100MB, 500MB)

==Development Status==

*I finished writing the perl and bash scripts for optimizing your wikipedia html dump. To obtain the dumps goto http://static.wikipedia.org. The scripts will soon be available on the mokopedia projects site on projects.openmoko.org.
*lighttpd is working on openmoko as a light webserver without too much overhead
*python script for accessing the articles is nearly finished
