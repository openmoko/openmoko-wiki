Mokopedia makes wikipedia accessible on your openmoko phone even without being online because all articles will reside in a compressed filesystem (squashFS) on your SD Card.

You will have to install lighttpd to access a local python script with the web browser of your choice. This script will offer you a text box to easily search your stored articles.

==Feature Ideas==
Please feel free to add anything that comes to your mind.
*it will have no pictures - not enough room on any storage media
*tex forumlas could be generated with a local LaTeX install but this may be too big for the phone
*all wikipedia versions except the english one will fit on a 1GB SDCard (tested with the second largest wikipedia (german)) - compressability tests with en-wiki in progress
*support for stripped down wikipedia versions (100MB, 500MB)

==Development Status==

*I finished writing the perl and bash scripts for optimizing your wikipedia html dump. To obtain the dumps goto http://static.wikipedia.org. The scripts are in svn on the mokopedia project site http://projects.openmoko.org/plugins/scmsvn/viewcvs.php/?root=mokopedia
*lighttpd is working on openmoko as a light webserver without too much overhead
*python script for accessing the articles is nearly finished

==Requirements==
*lighttpd
*changes in /etc/lighttpd.conf
<pre>enable server-module "mod_cgi"</pre>
<pre>#### CGI module
cgi.assign                  = ( ".pl"  => "/usr/bin/perl",
                                ".py"  => "/usr/bin/python",
                                ".cgi" => "/usr/bin/perl" )
</pre>
*python-core
*kernel-module-squashfs
*kernel-module-loop

To build the squashFS image on your PC instead of downloading ready-to-use-images you additionally need mksquashfs-tools

==Credits==
A big thank to the following people:
* kahuna for bringing me back to the idea of mokopedia as served html to a browser of your choice
* fgau for trying out everything I wrote on his neo
* thomasg for suggesting the use of a compressed file system
* Marcel_M for his great repository with squashfs and loop kernel modules http://celtune.morb-design.com/ipk/fic-gta01/
* everyone on #neo1973-germany
All you guys helped me a lot!!
