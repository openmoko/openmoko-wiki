This page is an attempt to specify User Provisionning parameters for data bearer services ("Point-To-Point Connection Orientated Network Service" as specified in [http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/02_series/02.60/0260-810.zip GSM 02.60]). It is more a proposal, a way to share thoughts about it than a final formal specification.
These parameters are used by the phone stacks to establish and setup a packet switched communication with the network. They are mainly grouped in two categories:
* Connection profile: the parameters used for activating the PDP context.
* Extra parameters: the parameters used for customizing the usage of the connection by the application, browser, J2ME MIDlet or any other


== Connection Profile ==

The proposed parameters are grouped in the following table. Each row is a parameter and is introduced with its name, type and description.
The first set of parameters are used for CSD (Circuit Switched Data) service.

!Name

!Description
|-
| '''''Dial Number'''''
| String
| Phone number to dial for connecting data service

The second set of parameters is used for GPRS connections

| '''''APN'''''
| String
| Access Point Name (as specified in [http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/07_series/07.60/0760-720.zip 3GPP TS 07.60])
|-

The third set of parameters is common to both:
