This page is a repository for alternate case designs for the [[Neo 1973]], intended to be designed, built and fitted by the community/the phone's owner. Many specific suggestions can be found in [[Wish List - Hardware#Casing]] and corresponding links.

Each alternate case design suggestion needs some or all of: a description, intended uses, design options, a 3D model in an open format (e.g. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format) .stl], .blend (Blender), .obj (Wavefront), [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_of_Illusion .aoi (Art of Illusion)] ), rendered images of the intended design, materials, components and information regarding interfacing electronically to components within the phone.

== Case schematics ==

== Manufacture ==

There are numerous rapid prototyping companies that will very cheaply make small run components from various polymers, including:

[http://www.absprototypes.net ABS Protytpes] - Invalid website name

[http://ponoko.com Ponoko] - requires EPS files (makes 2D flat cut-outs)

[http://rapidobject.com Rapid Object] - requires STL or VRML (for extra detailed models) files

[http://www.rapidprototyping.co.nz Rapid Prototyping New Zealand] - 3D powder based printer, not particularly well suited to this application.

[http://www.redeyerpm.com/Default.aspx Red Eye RPM] - requires STL files

Other materials may require traditional manufacturing techniques including milling, forging, injection-moulding, either by the user or short-run companies such as:

[http://emachineshop.com/ eMachine Shop] - Requires companies own MS Windows based drawing software

[http://www.msersen.net/msgme.php?p={$pagef}&c={$setcount}/ (4 axis) gantry style cnc router for hire.  Click for inquiries]

==Cost Example==
Rapid Object charge from 1.9 Euros per cm^3 of material (photosensitive polymer) used, plus postage. The case for the Neo looks to be about 1.5mm thick, so conservatively, the back of the case will be approximately:<br>
120 x 60 x 1.5<br>
+ 120 x 9 x 1.5 x 2 (2 sides)<br>
= 10,800<br>
+ 3,240

= 14,040 mm^3

~ 14 cm^3

~ 26 Euros

and the front will be (allowing for the screen hole):<br>
(120 x 60 - 43 x 58) x 1.5<br>
+ 120 x 9 x 1.5 x 2 (2 sides)<br>
= 7,059<br>
+ 3,240

= 10,299 mm^3

~ 10cm^3

~ 19 Euros

==Notes==
Some users may want combinations of the variants listed - popular/simple options such as Stylus Mount/Different speaker orientation/Extra battery/Extra storage may be combined into one model. This should be taken into account when creating 3D models; i.e. it will simplify things later if the addition of (say) a solar panel, does not encroach on the area used for a touch strip, etc.

== Design Variant Suggestions ==
Some of these are a copy of requests in [[Wish List - Hardware#Casing]], some are from ideas thrown up in the community mailing list.

Many of these cannot be implemented without some design changes to the phone PCB. As mentioned in [[Expansion Back]]
