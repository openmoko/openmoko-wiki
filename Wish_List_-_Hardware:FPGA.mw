===AT91CAP9S500A (ARM9 + FPGA-port)===
Why FPGA?:
*[http://www.newsroom.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/display.cgi?id=1689 October 17, 2007 ucr.edu: UC Riverside Research Leads to Self-Improving Chips with Speed ‘Warping’] Computer science research results in new technology that can outperform standard microprocessors up to 1,000 times.

Take a look at this microcontroller, that integrates an ARM9 microcontroller and a dedicated FPGA port: AT91CAP9S500A. It has "only" a max. clock at 200MHz, but can use a FPGA for hardware acceleration, that could be used for video (de)compression, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AacPlus_v2 aacPlus v2]/[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HE-AAC_v2 HE-AAC v2] sound (de)compression and many other things. HE-AAC v2 is better than [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3 MP3].

Its distributed DMA architecture enables multiple data transfers to take place between the processor, memories and peripherals with minimal processor overhead...".

This seems to be a good hardware mix (ARM+FPGA). It does [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theora Ogg Theora] or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MJPEG MJPEG] in the FPGA with 1 million gates:

I do not think this means what you think it means... I read "...and a metal programmable (MP) block of 500K gates of digital logic." as meaning that it's a one-time programmable block, more akin to a standard-cell ASIC than an FPGA. This is supported by the fact that their development board contains a separate FPGA chip. Now, granted, having a 500K gate ASIC on board an ARM is a cool thing... but not quite as cool as this chip appeared at first glance.

==Possible FPGA==
This FPGA is just an example:
