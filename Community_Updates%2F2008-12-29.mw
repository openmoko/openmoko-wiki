Based on [http://people.openmoko.org/sean_mcneil/ Sean's image], Wendy from Openmoko produced [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/devel/2008-December/003877.html test reports] ([http://people.openmoko.org/testing/software/Android_on_freerunner_review.pdf PDF]) concluding that Android Image On Freerunner really looks good, but [...] not ready to be a daily phone yet. Interesting applications waiting to be fixed to work on Freerunner include bluetooth, wifi, GPS, browser...
* [http://www.hackable1.org hackable:1] announced ([http://www.hackable1.org/wiki/Documentation documentation]). Led by Marcus Bauer of TangoGPS fame, this project aims to implement the GNOME Mobile stack on top of Debian on FreeRunner. Its installation is specially simple: [http://www.hackable1.org/hackable1/?C=M;O=D download] the tarball, unpack the files on a 2 GB SD card, put the card in the FreeRunner.

* Nathan shared his [http://natha.nkinka.de/gprs_launcher.sh GPRS launcher] script and the [http://natha.nkinka.de/gtkdialog-0.7.9_0.1_armv4t.ipk ipk for Gtkdialog] it uses. The script can be used to start the connection, stop the connection, or to simply find out the current GPRS status.
* Openmoko's next generation telephony, messaging and addressbook application [http://code.google.com/p/paroli/ paroli] was merged with tichy, the application starter. So opkg install tichy, setup according to Mirko's email, and enjoy.
* Angus [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-December/038531.html offers] a "where are you now" daemon that can SMS back its location upon request.

== Applications updates == 
* [http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~taw27/openmoko/openmoocow/ OpenMoocow] 0.3 released. Changes include: better graphics from openclipart.org by "bsantos", more responsive, kernel 2.6.28 new sysfs paths ready, thinkpad HDAPS merged in.
* [[ZOMG!]], an opkg frontend, updated. Faster, cacao and jamvm compatible (jamvm still recommended).
* [[navit]], a drivers' GPS navigation system ([http://trac.navit-project.org trac]) is being optimized for the FreeRunner by Christian Anke and others.
* [http://www.weeklyworldshrew.com Damian A. Spriggs] started working on a MAME port. The Multimedia Arcade Machine Emulator is a must for all retro-gamers out there. I can't wait to play P*c-M*n and G*l*xi*n again on my subway commute !
* Angus updated pymixer.py to use the FSO framework. It should automatically detect scenario changes and update the mixers now. Put [http://handheldshell.com/fsomixer.py fsomixer.py] into /usr bin and chmod +x it. [http://handheldshell.com/volume_fso.desktop volume_fso.desktop] goes into /usr/share/applications.
* The [[Zedlock]] screen locker rewritten and re-released as 0.0.1 prototype.
* [http://projects.openmoko.org/projects/siglaunchd/ siglaunchd], a daemon which listens to dbus signals and runs applications accordingly, got regular expressions (string patterns) matching, and was ported to C. For example, one can set the aux button to launch the dialer and the other can set a sound when screen is dimmed with as little as no effort.

* [http://code.google.com/p/omnewrotate/ omnewrotate] 0.5.3. Updated for 2008.12 compatibility.

== Community ==

* Recognizing that they have never been able to get the [http://projects.openmoko.org projects gforge] running well, Openmoko decided to [http://lists.openmoko.org/nabble.html#nabble-td1661304 throw the towel and terminate the project]. Sean said: "If somebody wants to step up and own this responsibility -- you bet -- we'll pay the bill." Luckily Armin Ranjbar (a.k.a. zoup from FDOM), stepped forward (among others) to lead the newly formed, community-led gforge administration team on the Openmoko server. He is creating an admin mailing list were interested people can join him (link needed).
* [http://opkg.org opkg.org] relaunched ! New look, same API. Now if Openmoko wants to terminate useless projects, how about the "community repository" ? Is there any community project to feed opkg from the gforge ? 
* The documentation team discussed on how to write the missing Neo's reference handbook.
* [http://rschuster.blogs.evolvis.org/2008/12/21/serving-cross-compiled-openjdk-with-icedtea/ OpenJDK integration into Jalimo]  was finished, including packaging. Cacao+OpenJDK runs on the FreeRunner. A step towards better Java support in all OpenEmbedded devices.

== Hardware ==
*  The technical feasibility of fixing the "buzz" at a reasonable price was confirmed by several hardware repair shops. Steve is still working on the program to bring that "big capacitor" rework to users worldwide. The technical draft is still being worked on: how to open the case, how to test, possibility of using alternative capacitor types (although these will be provided for free by OM), possibility of applying other A6 -> A7 hardware upgrades like the GPS/uSD fix at the same time... Do not expect resolution before CES (jan 8-11). Meanwhile, DIYers [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-December/038565.html will be supported].
* The level of lust for 3G on GTA03 reached astounding highs on the community mailing list. For a reality check before dreaming further, read Carsten explanations on [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-December/038395.html the costs of a 3G module]. For insights about schedules, read Steve's explanations on [http://n2.nabble.com/Openmoko-Community-f1954.html production in real life].

== Tips and tricks ==

* No audio on 2008.9 after suspend/resume ? Try killing and uninstalling speech-dispatcher. '' '''Note (gcasse):''' your workaround masks [https://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1599 #1599 (Suspend / resume breaks audio] when navit + speech-dispatcher have been installed''.
* Terminal-based applications slow to startup on FDOM ? Try opkg remove termcap, processing /etc/termcap each time takes like 10 seconds.
* Media player so sloooow it's unusable ? Try running it with a -15 nice priority value (For users of pythm+mplayer, set it up in /etc/pythm.conf).
* A cooler theme in 2008.12 ? Try replacing "asu" with "illume" /etc/enlightenment/default_profile.
* Enlightenment eating 20% CPU ? Disable drop shadows by deleting /usr/lib/enlightenment/modules/dropshadow.
* Enlightenment crashing with the illume theme in 2008.12 ? Try disabling drop shadows. Otherwise, change the "Engine" in the enlightenment config from SOFTWARE_16 to SOFTWARE (to access the config, disable qtopia under /etc/X11/Xsession.d first, restart X, do the config, then move qtopia back).
