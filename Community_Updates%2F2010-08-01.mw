==Distributions==
{{DistributionBox|
Name=Debian GNU/Linux |
Description=[[Debian]] is a universal operating system used on many other embedded devices, and also on home computers. Using Debian on the FreeRunner gives access to the huge army of software packaged in the Debian repositories, already compiled for the Neo's arm(v4) processor. Moreover, one can build one's own source files for programs without having to learn the OpenEmbedded way. For an existing Debian/Ubuntu user, choosing Debian for Neo FreeRunner makes phone a very familiar, trustworthy and flexible place to hack in.<br><br>
* A new [[e17]] snapshot has been uploaded to Debian (0.7.0.49898)
* The remaining SHR packages were prepared for main inclusion and are now in the NEW queue: libphoneui-shr, phoneuid, phoneui-apps
* [[Intone]] got updated to the most current revision (r77)
* [[FoxtrotGPS]] was uploaded to Debian main archive and replaced TangoGPS
* fso-gsmd is still depending on vala version that is only in the experimental branch, and therefore not compiled for FreeRunner yet|

==Applications== 

No application reports this month, although surely there are new releases all the time :)

==Community==

Most important and change making mails on the mailing lists, blogs etc.. Coolest hacks, screenshots, themes etc..

* ''Gennady Kupava'' proceeded onwards in his amazing work from overclocking FreeRunner (see [[Community Updates/2010-07-01]]) to speeding up Glamo graphics chip's timing settings: http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2010-July/062495.html . As always, proceed with your own risk, but indeed this is not overclocking but pure timing settings tweaking similar to DDR latency settings in ordinary computer BIOSes.
* While ordinary users might stick to the venerable 2.6.29 ("andy-tracking") branch or try out 2.6.32, the newest development actually already happens in branches based on Linux kernel 2.6.34: http://git.openmoko.org/?p=kernel.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/om-gta02-2.6.34 . Work done by ''Thibaut Girka'', ''Lars-Peter Clausen'', ''Thomas White'' and ''Martin Jansa'' - thanks to all effort by these guys, testers and other helpers!
* The 2.6.32 kernel branches at git.openmoko.org are not currently completely ready for end users. [[SHR]] maintains a big bunch of patches that are needed for some components to work: http://cgit.openembedded.org/cgit.cgi/openembedded/tree/recipes/linux/linux-openmoko-2.6.32

* Golden Delicious Computers released Openmoko Beagle Hybrid Boards including GPS and a gyroscope. At the same time, they [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2010-July/062609.html announced] plans to develop the next open hardware phone. Based on a OMAP3530 SoC this device will bring a lot of computing power to your pocket.

* The [[Freerunner Navigation Board v2]] is being tested right now. The first fully assembled boards are expected to arrive within the next two weeks. If you are interested in buying one you can still [[Talk:Freerunner_Navigation_Board_v2|specify]] which chips you'd like to have preassembled.
