==Distributions==
{{DistributionBox|
Name=Debian GNU/Linux |
Description=[[Debian]] is a universal operating system used on many other embedded devices, and also on home computers. Using Debian on the FreeRunner gives access to the huge army of software packaged in the Debian repositories, already compiled for the Neo's arm(v4) processor. Moreover, one can build one's own source files for programs without having to learn the OpenEmbedded way. For an existing Debian/Ubuntu user, choosing Debian for Neo FreeRunner makes phone a very familiar, trustworthy and flexible place to hack in.<br><br>
* A new [[e17]] snapshot has been uploaded to Debian (0.7.0.49898)
* The remaining SHR packages are prepared for main inclusion (they will probably arrive some days after this community update): libphoneui-shr, phoneuid, phoneui-apps
* [[Intone]] got updated to the most current revision (r77)
* [[FoxtrotGPS]] was uploaded to Debian main archive and replaced TangoGPS
* [[fso-gsmd]] is still depending on vala version that is only in the experimental branch, and therefore not compiled for FreeRunner yet|

==Community==
Most important and change making mails on the mailing lists, blogs etc.. Coolest hacks, screenshots, themes etc..

* ''Gennady Kupava'' proceeded onwards in his amazing work from overclocking FreeRunner (see [[Community Updates/2010-07-01]]) to speeding up Glamo graphics chip's timing settings: http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2010-July/062495.html . As always, proceed with your own risk, but indeed this is not overclocking but pure timing settings tweaking similar to DDR latency settings in ordinary computer BIOSes.
* While ordinary users might stick to the venerable 2.6.29 ("andy-tracking") branch or try out 2.6.32, the newest development actually already happens in branches based on Linux kernel 2.6.34: http://git.openmoko.org/?p=kernel.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/om-gta02-2.6.34 . Work done by ''Thibaut Girka'', ''Lars-Peter Clausen'', ''Thomas White'' and ''Martin Jansa'' - thanks to all effort by these guys, testers and other helpers!
* The 2.6.32 kernel branches at git.openmoko.org are not currently completely ready for end users. [[SHR]] maintains a big bunch of patches that are needed for some components to work: http://cgit.openembedded.org/cgit.cgi/openembedded/tree/recipes/linux/linux-openmoko-2.6.32
