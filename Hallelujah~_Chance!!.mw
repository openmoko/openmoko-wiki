'''Short description'''：

The purpose of this project is to provide a service for users to help determine the dilemma they are facing. We made use of the Chinese traditional lots-drawing game to implement this project. Users (players) can enter their decisions (candidates) and then shake the Neo Freerunner with sincerity. Then the result will display on the screen for  the user to reference. We hope this service can make users happier and help free them when stuck in a dilemma.
