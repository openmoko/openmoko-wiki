*Add a Digital Barometer, Compass (make use of the gyroscope hardware suggested elsewhere) and Elevation Meter, as well as an integrated link to online weather services would make for a fine fully functional world thermometer and weather forecaster. Visual Interface could be very nice if show as an old fashion meter next to an alpha numeric display of info. --[[User:Jamie K|Jamie K]] 15:04, 17 April 2007 (CEST)

The variometer signal is simply the derivative of the barometer signal. It gives a much more accurate vertical speed signal than is possible with GPS. It would probably be best to filter and differentiate the analog pressure signal and then digitize. This kind of measurement is used by the flee flying community (hanggliding, paragliding, ballooning). A device that allows teams of pilots to share position and speed (with accurate vertical speed) data would be lots of fun.
