=== What is gsmd ===
'''Gsmd''' is a daemon that handles the communication between applications and GSM modem.
Applications control gsmd through '''libgsmd'''. 
libgsmd communicates with gsmd through unix socket, and modem goes through Uart.

== Gsmd ==
GSMD is a event driven daemon. Each event shall has a response. 
Every event will pass through the '''gsmd_select_main()''' in which finding and executing their correspond call back functions.

=== gsmd_select_main() ===
gsmd_select_main this is core of the call back function scheme. All devices, gsmd monitors, are put into a struct '''[[gsmd_fd]]''', and gsmd_select_main will select it. 
Once an event comes out from one of the devices, gsmd_select_main will try to call it's call back function that devices registered.

==== gsmd_fd ====
 struct gsmd_fd {
     struct llist_head list;
     int fd;                         /* file descriptor */
     unsigned int when;
     int (*cb)(int fd, unsigned int what, void *data);
     void *data;                     /* void * to pass to callback */
 };
