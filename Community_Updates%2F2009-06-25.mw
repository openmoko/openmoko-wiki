====='''Period May 22nd to June 25th, 2009'''=====
==Important==

On June 2nd, Sean Moss-Pultz (CEO of Openmoko Inc.) announced a major change in the Openmoko world: the development of open phones was discontinued by Openmoko Inc. It will be assigned to the Community, so '''everybody''' (including You, dear reader) is called to participate in this big challenge: make the project survive and grow!

The complete transition will happen in the coming months.

In the meantime Openmoko is beginning to move on the new course, the [[FSO]] team is looking for funding and continues development, we should expect the 5.5 release in a few days, the same for [[Paroli]], 4 new developers are able to improve and maintain the kernel, but a lot of help is needed. Every contribution is important in order to realize the transition, so organization experts, developers, system administrators, testers, translators, wiki editors, all are welcome to get involved!

==Wiki==


===Community Transition===
A [[Community transition]] wiki page has been created to organize and coordinate the efforts of the planned transition mentioned above. Not much has been shaped yet and alot of work needs to be done. Feel invited to jump in and help establishing a robust and solid base for a great community. We need a community which is able to maintain itself and take over areas of responsibility from Openmoko Inc.

===Discussion Boards===
A new wiki section was started to organize ideas and discuss technical aspects to help developers and maintainers to create software and distributions giving to users a better experience with the freerunner. It's not a "single shot" wish list, but a place to signal conceptual issues, propose ideas, discuss about pro/cons and give hints on how to implement/fix them, the final target is to minimize the project phase for developers and distro maintainers. Please partecipate to [[Discussion Boards]].
