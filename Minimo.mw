= Installing Minimo web browser =

[http://www-archive.mozilla.org/projects/minimo/ Minimo] is a Mozilla based web browser. It features full [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29 AJAX] support and other goodies. Currently stock Openmoko build doesn't include Minimo.
== Running on Om2009-beta ==
Follow the 2008 instructions, with two exceptions:
# you may not be able to unpack a .bz2 archive on the Freerunner, in which case download and unpack on your computer, and then ssh the files over to the Freerunner
# If you get a gtk+-fastscaling dependency error, run the following command for installation instead:
<pre>
opkg install minimo_0.02\+cvs20070626-r0_armv4t.ipk -force-depends
</pre>

"gtk+-fastscaling is just gtk+ these days, and you should be able to override it with -force-depends or something like this" [http://lists.openmoko.org/nabble.html#nabble-td2654384]
== Running on Om2008.8 ==

From the Neo, download the minimo package:

<pre>
wget http://www.ginguppin.de/files/minimo.tar.bz2
</pre>

Unpack it:

<pre>
tar -xjf minimo.tar.bz2
</pre>

Then install it:

<pre>
opkg install minimo_0.02\+cvs20070626-r0_armv4t.ipk
</pre>

If you get the following error:

* ERROR: Cannot satisfy the following dependencies for minimo:
*  libfreetype6 (>= 2.3.6) *

First try:

<pre>
opkg install libfreetype6
</pre>

If this does not install a libfreetype6 version > 2.3.6, you can download a newer libfreetype6 from the Angstrom repository at this location: http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/repo/?action=details&pnm=libfreetype6

Ex:

<pre>
wget http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/feeds/2008/ipk/glibc/armv4t/base/libfreetype6_2.3.6-r0.1_armv4t.ipk
opkg install libfreetype6_2.3.6-r0.1_armv4t.ipk
opkg install minimo_0.02\+cvs20070626-r0_armv4t.ipk
</pre>

Using Minimo with the stock Om2008.8 gets annoying because the keyboard always takes up half the screen.  I recommend reactivating the [[Keyboard_Toggle#Reactivating_the_keyboard_toggle_under_Om2008.8|Keyboard Toggle]] so that you can hide the keyboard while browsing.

I also highly recommend getting [[GPRS]] going so that you can browse on the go!

== Running on Om2008.4 ==

Download the minimo package:

<pre>
wget http://www.ginguppin.de/files/minimo.tar.bz2
</pre>

Unpack it:

<pre>
tar -xjf minimo.tar.bz2
</pre>

and install:

<pre>
opkg install minimo_*
</pre>

If any packages are missing, just install it from repository.

== Running in Xephyr PC environment ==

Here are instructions on how to run minimo in Xephyr PC environment and how to use other third party packages too.

* [http://bec-systems.com/web/content/view/79/9/ Instructions for including new OpenEmbedded packages to your project]

These instructions should be updated to use a custom image rather than DISTRO_EXTRA_RDEPENDS -- see link above.

Alternatively, a binary ipkg was posted here[[http://www.ginguppin.de/files/minimo.tar.bz2]]

=== Setup build environment ===

If you have built your Openmoko using MokoMakefile some of these steps might not be familiar to you.

Assume your Openmoko root is at ~/workspace/moko

First setup build environment variables:
<pre>
moo@hacker:~/workspace/moko/build$ . ../setup-env
</pre>

Then checkout minimo from OpenEmbedded repository:
<pre>
moo@hacker:~/workspace/moko/build$ bitbake minimo
</pre>

Edit local.conf and add minimo to build dependencies list.

<pre>
MACHINE = "qemux86"
DISTRO = "openmoko"
BUILD_ARCH = "i686"
INHERIT += " devshell"
SRCDATE_eds-dbus = "now"
DISTRO_EXTRA_RDEPENDS = "minimo"
</pre>

After local.conf has added new packages, one must refresh bitbake tasks.

<pre>
bitbake task-base -crebuild
</pre>

Now, you should be able to rebuild root fs using MokoMakefile.

<pre>
make openmoko-devel-image
</pre>

=== Tips ===

The default Openmoko distribution lacks ''/etc/resolv.conf'' file which is used to configure system DNS look-up. Without this file, failing  domain name look-up prevents web browsing. The easiest way to fix is to copy the host system resolv.conf to the rootfs.

<pre>
moo@hacker:~/workspace/moko$ cp /etc/resolv.conf rootfs/etc/resolv.conf
</pre>


If build fails with

<pre>
/usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible $OMDIR/local/tmp/staging/arm-angstrom-linux-gnueabi/lib/libIDL-2.a when searching for -lIDL-2
</pre>
(here minimo is installed in a [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Application_Development_Crash_Course#Setting_Up_a_Local_Overlay Local Overlay], so your path will perhaps differ) try installing the libidl-dev package on the buildhost:

<pre>
sudo aptitude install libidl-dev
</pre>

Currently, nothing shows up in the Homebase page (under FSO, anyway).  If anyone knows a solution, please update here.  For this reason, there really are no bookmarks to speak of.

=== In chroot'ed environment ===

Following instructions in [[Getting Openmoko working on host with Xephyr]] to get yourself chroot'ed into Openmoko environment.

Start Xephyr. You don't need to start Openmoko session, minimo can run as is.

<pre>
/ $ minimo
</pre>
