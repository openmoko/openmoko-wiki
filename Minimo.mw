= Installing Minimo web browser =

[http://www.mozilla.org/projects/minimo/develop.html Minimo] is a Mozilla based web browser. It features full AJAX support and other goodies. Currently stock OpenMoko build doesn't include Minimo. Here are instructions on how to run minimo in Xephyr PC environment and how to use other third party packages too. 

* [http://bec-systems.com/web/content/view/59/9/ Instructions for including new OpenEmbedded packages to your project]

== Setup build environment ==

If you have built your OpenMoko using MokoMakefile some of these steps might not be familiar to you.

Assume your OpenMoko root is at ~/workspace/moko

First setup build environment variables:
<pre>
moo@hacker:~/workspace/moko/build$ . ../setup-env 
</pre>

Then checkout minimo from OpenEmbedded repository:
<pre>
moo@hacker:~/workspace/moko/build$ bitbake minimo
</pre>

Edit local.conf and add minimo to build dependencies list.

<pre>
MACHINE = "qemux86"
DISTRO = "openmoko"
BUILD_ARCH = "i686"
INHERIT += " devshell"
SRCDATE_eds-dbus = "now"
DISTRO_EXTRA_RDEPENDS = "minimo"
</pre>

After local.conf has added new packages, one must refresh bitbake tasks.

<pre>
bitbake task-base -crebuild
</pre>

Now, you should be able to rebuild root fs using MokoMakefile.

<pre>
make openmoko-devel-image
</pre>


The default OpenMoko distribution lacks ''/etc/resolv.conf'' file which is used to configure system DNS look-up. Without this file, failing  domain name look-up prevents web browsing. The easiest way to fix is to copy the host system resolv.conf to the rootfs.

<pre>
moo@hacker:~/workspace/moko$ cp /etc/resolv.conf rootfs/etc/resolv.conf
</pre>

== In chroot'ed environment ==

Following instructions in [[Getting OpenMoko working on host with Xephyr]] to get yourself chroot'ed into OpenMoko environment. 

Start Xephyr. You don't need to start OpenMoko session, minimo can run as is. 

<pre>
/ $ minimo  
</pre>
