{{FSO}}

The ringtone in milestone 2 is stored here:

 /usr/share/sounds/Arkanoid_PSID.sid

Fun fact : according to the gstreamer documentation, .sid files are in fact small Commodore 64 programs that are executed on an emulated 6502 CPU and a MOS 6581 sound chip. 

Now to change it is a little bit of fun.

first change directory to

 /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/framework/subsystems/oeventd/

and open the file parser.py

#this will be /var/lib/python-support/python2.5/framework/subsystems/oeventd/parser.py if you are using FSO under Debian

Search for PlaySound. Edit the 2 lines to point to your wav or mp3 file.

There does seem to be a lag of a few vibrations before the sound starts but that might desirable. (I didn't compare against the original code).  The code to specifically handle formats, (oggs for example) can be a little complicated and makes things messy.
Since, it seems like this code is changing in FSO, I'm leaving it for the moment.

Then

 mv receiver.pyo /home/root 

#receiver.pyo will be receiver.pyc in FSO under Debian

 python
  >>> import py_compile
  >>> py_compile.compile("parser.py")
  >>> quit()
#You may not have the py_compile module. You can install them like this:
 opkg install python-compile

 /etc/init.d/fso-frameworkd restart && /etc/init.d/zhone-session stop && sleep 2 && /etc/init.d/zhone-session start
#I've only run the above restart commands in Debian so I'm not sure if they are the same in the default FSO image
#the default zhone-session file doesn't have a working restart command, hence the stop->sleep 2->start

zhone for FSO seems to be launched by Xsession.d so maybe try:
 /etc/init.d/xserver-nodm restart

Now you can link /usr/share/sounds/ringtone to any mp3 (or other sound file if you took the second option) and that will be your ringtone
