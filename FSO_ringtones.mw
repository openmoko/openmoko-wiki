==The milestone 3 way==
FSO milestone 3 introduces some configuration files for Zhone. It is now possible to define as many ringtone profiles as we want. Each profile is a YAML configuration file located in :
/etc/freesmartphone/opreferences/conf/phone

After adding another profile to /etc/freesmartphone/opreferences/conf/phone you have to add it to /etc/freesmartphone/opreferences/conf/profiles/default.yaml

The default profile is defined in the default.yaml file :
ring-tone: "Arkanoid_PSID.sid"
ring-volume: 10

To change this default ringtone :
# copy the sound file into /usr/share/sounds/
# edit the "ring-tone" field to match your sound filename.

====<font color=crimson>Note for Debian users</font>====
Depending on the '''fso-frameworkd''' package version (<= 0.2.0-git20080909-2) you may have to use [http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-fso-commits/2008-September/000158.html this patch].

==The milestone 2 way==
The ringtone in milestone 2 is stored here:

 /usr/share/sounds/Arkanoid_PSID.sid

Fun fact : according to the gstreamer documentation, .sid files are in fact small Commodore 64 programs that are executed on an emulated 6502 CPU and a MOS 6581 sound chip. 

Now to change it is a little bit of fun.

first change directory to

 /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/framework/subsystems/oeventd/

and open the file parser.py

#this will be /var/lib/python-support/python2.5/framework/subsystems/oeventd/parser.py if you are using FSO under Debian

Search for PlaySound. Edit the 2 lines to point to your wav or mp3 file.

There does seem to be a lag of a few vibrations before the sound starts but that might desirable. (I didn't compare against the original code).  The code to specifically handle formats, (oggs for example) can be a little complicated and makes things messy.
Since, it seems like this code is changing in FSO, I'm leaving it for the moment.

Then

 mv receiver.pyo /home/root 

#receiver.pyo will be receiver.pyc in FSO under Debian

 python
  >>> import py_compile
  >>> py_compile.compile("parser.py")
  >>> quit()
#You may not have the py_compile module. You can install them like this:
 opkg install python-compile

 /etc/init.d/fso-frameworkd restart && /etc/init.d/zhone-session stop && sleep 2 && /etc/init.d/zhone-session start
#I've only run the above restart commands in Debian so I'm not sure if they are the same in the default FSO image
#the default zhone-session file doesn't have a working restart command, hence the stop->sleep 2->start

zhone for FSO seems to be launched by Xsession.d so maybe try:
 /etc/init.d/xserver-nodm restart

Now you can link /usr/share/sounds/ringtone to any mp3 (or other sound file if you took the second option) and that will be your ringtone

== Different ringtones by caller ID==

 First, have a look at ./etc/freesmartphone/oevents/rules.yaml. This is
 our rules file, where we define that a ringtone should play once a call
 comes in. Now you probably have to enhance the RingTone atom to make it
 aware of the 'peer' entry in the dbus signal CallStatus. Once you have
 that, you should be able to add numbers to the rules that trigger
 different ringtones.
