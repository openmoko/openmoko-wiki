The ringtone in milestone 2 is stored here:

/usr/share/sounds/Arkanoid_PSID.sid

Now to change it is a little bit of fun.

first in

/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/framework/subsystems/oeventd/receiver.py

Change the line that reads:

decoder = gst.element_factory_make( "siddec", "decoder" )

to

decoder = gst.element_factory_make( "mad", "decoder" )


and change the line that reads:

filesrc.set_property( "location", "/usr/share/sounds/Arkanoid_PSID.sid" )

to

filesrc.set_property( "location", "/usr/share/sounds/ringtone" )

Then

mv /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/framework/subsystems/oeventd/receiver.pyo /home/root

then reboot the phone ( I'm sure there's a better way to regenerate receiver.pyo but I don't know it )

Now you can link /usr/share/sounds/ringtone to any mp3 and that will be your ringtone
