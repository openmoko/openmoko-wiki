{{FSO}}

The ringtone in milestone 2 is stored here:

 /usr/share/sounds/Arkanoid_PSID.sid

Now to change it is a little bit of fun.

first change directory to

 /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/framework/subsystems/oeventd/

and open the file receiver.py

#this will be /var/lib/python-support/python2.5/framework/subsystems/oeventd/receiver.py if you are using FSO under Debian

Change the line that reads:

decoder = gst.element_factory_make( "siddec", "decoder" )

to

decoder = gst.element_factory_make( "mad", "decoder" )


and change the line that reads:

filesrc.set_property( "location", "/usr/share/sounds/Arkanoid_PSID.sid" )

to

filesrc.set_property( "location", "/usr/share/sounds/ringtone" )

Then

 mv receiver.pyo /home/root 
#receiver.pyo will be receiver.pyc in FSO under Debian


 python
  >>> import py_compile
  >>> py_compile.compile("receiver.py")
  >>> quit()
#You may not have the py_compile module. You can install them like this:
 opkg install python-compile

 /etc/init.d/fso-frameworkd restart && /etc/init.d/zhone-session stop && sleep 2 && /etc/init.d/zhone-session start
#I've only run the above restart commands in Debian so I'm not sure if they are the same in the default FSO image
#the default zhone-session file doesn't have a working restart command, hence the stop->sleep 2->start

Now you can link /usr/share/sounds/ringtone to any mp3 and that will be your ringtone
