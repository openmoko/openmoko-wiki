[[OpenMoko]], 是用OpenEmbedded构建的。OpenEmbedded将做到：

* 为多个嵌入式目标环境生成（交叉编译）软件包。
* 处理不同的硬件体系结构，提供多个版本来支持这些不同的体系结构。

== Master Build Server ==

There is a master build server, it has the hostname buildhost.openmoko.org.  Shell accounts are only available to core developers and the "distribution maintainer", once we have created such a job/task ;)

The idea is that all official images and binary packages (ipk) are built on one machine with a well-defined environment.

== Build Process with OpenEmbedded ==

=== OE upstream snapshot ===

We start from an OpenEmbedded snapshot from the official "upstream" aka "Vanilla" OpenEmbedded project. This snapshot contains the [[BitBake recipe]]s for thousands of packages

=== OpenMoko OE overlay tree ===

In addition to the upstream recipies, we also have a set of our own recipies.  They are available from http://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/oe/ ([http://svnweb.openmoko.org/trunk/oe/ SVNweb]).

The ''overlay'' tree works in the following way: It gives us the ability to add rules below a seperate directory tree.  This means we don't have to edit or add rules to the upstream snapshot, and we always have a clear distinction about what is upstream, and what is our additions to it.

=== Upstream Source tarballs ===

When bitbake builds a particular OE package, it downloads the original source code of the upstream project (e.g. Linux kernel) from the web.
After downloading it, it applies a series of local patches to it.  Those patches are from either the [[OpenEmbedded#OE_upstream_snapshot]], or from the [[OpenEmbedded#OpenMoko_OE_overlay_tree]].  

The unpatched source tarballs are available from http://buildhost.openmoko.org/sources/

=== 构建目录===

The content of the build directory is available at
* http://buildhost.openmoko.org/OM2007.1/tmp/ (old OpenMoko tree)
* http://buildhost.openmoko.org/OM2007.2/tmp/ (new OpenMoko tree)

It contains
* cache
** Internal caching data, not for human interpretation
* cross
** The cross-compilation toolchain used. You can download this and use it on your local machine.
* deploy
** deploy/images
*** The filesystem, kernel and bootloader images to be flashed into NAND
** deploy/ipk
*** the .ipk packages
* rootfs
** the extracted root filesystem. Please use the images from deploy/images instead
* staging
** no user servicable parts inside
* stamp
** internal state data
* work
** the actual build trees (including patches source code and binaries) of the individual packages

=== 二进制包===

The binary packages of intermediate "unofficial" releases are available at 
* http://buildhost.openmoko.org/OM2007.1/tmp/deploy/ipk (old OpenMoko tree)
* http://buildhost.openmoko.org/OM2007.2/tmp/deploy/ipk (new OpenMoko tree)

The snapshots (which have recieved some testing) are available at http://buildhost.openmoko.org/snapshots/
