{{note|TI revision number had never been released from TI, what we only have is released date. You can get complete firmware revision through AT+CGMR}}

=== Moko1 ===
* The code base is n7_19 released from TI at 04/19/2007
* Support the AT Command AT@ST to control the sidetone level
* Support the AT Command AT@AUL to load the audio table
* Generate wakeup interrupt to s3c2410
* Support the AT Command AT@POFF to power off GSM modem
* Support these AT Commands, AT+CGSN,AT+CGMM,AT+CGMR,AT+CGMI

=== Moko2 ===
* Based on Moko1
* Remove the TI's implementation of wakeup interrupt.When GSM modem get an incoming call, it will pullup the pin TPU_IDLE to generate an interrupt, since we have implement the wakeup function ourselves, just remove it.

=== Moko3 ===
* Based on Moko2 and '''modified libs''' release from TI at 06/22/2007
* Support deep sleep(power saving issue)
* known issues:
** We need to power off GSM modem from Application processor through external interrupt, hence we need to implement an isr within GSM modem to do that.
** For current gsmd, it doesn't support wake-up function. Hence,when modem falls into deep-sleep, gsmd will be blocked because it couldn't receieve respond from modem. 

=== Moko4 ===
* Based on Moko3
* Fix Bug 212, setting AT@ST is broken

=== Moko5 ===
* Based on Moko4
* Fix Bug 666, AT&T 3G fireball USIM
* Specific information of +CGMM, +CGMR, +CGMI are stored in GSM filesystem, not hard-coded anymore.
** All specific info can be download from https://people.internal.openmoko.org/sean_chiang/gsm/firmware/info/
** ti_tat(M$ compatible), which used to read/write GSM internal filesystem can be found at https://people.internal.openmoko.org/sean_chiang/gsm/sw/
* Pass the PTCRB certification
* Support [850/900]/1800/1900
* Support SMS memory full alert event
* Support the at command AT@RST to reset GSM modem

=== Moko6 ===
* Based on Moko5
* Specific information is hard-coded, that means, there'll have different moko6 for different hw version.
** Because the hw problem cause the ti_tat unstable, we roll back to hard-coded scheme.
* We don't need rfcap anymore, it'll be written into GSM filesystem automatically when modem power on. 

=== Moko7 ===
* Based on Moko6
* Support [.. NDA edited (jOERG) ..]

=== Moko8 ===
* Based on Moko7
* Support AT@BAND to get current band, 900, 1800, 850 or 1900.
* TI updated the l2r.lib for SIM Card Write Endurance issue.
* Note
** T-mobile re-camping problem : 4 Neo but only one has this problem, close this issue.
** AT&T re-camping problem remains open. See #1024

=== Moko9-Beta1 ===
* Should be same as Moko8 , but built from scratch by Dieter spaar@openmoko.org
* updated TI libs, fix #666 (unconfirmed, but likely)
* Does '''not''' fix #1024
* Public as in http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/GSM/Flashing

=== Moko9-Beta2 ===
* Adds "AT+CSIM" (for swisscom)

=== Moko10 ===
* MOKO9 with version string changed to not longer show hw-revision of device.

=== Moko11-beta1 ===
* GPIO 1 is no longer set erroneously to high after reset
* Hardware assisted CTS handshake is enabled to avoid sending characters
    from TX fifo after CTS goes high

=== Moko11 ===
changed version-string (remove "beta")
