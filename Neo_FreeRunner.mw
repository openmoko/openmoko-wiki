The Neo FreeRunner (internal codename GTA02) is the second phone designed to run Openmoko software and is the direct descendant of the earlier [[FIC]] [[Neo1973]]. Hardware specs are at [[Neo FreeRunner GTA02 Hardware]].

== FreeRunner is released ==

The FreeRunner can be purchased from the [http://www.openmoko.com Online Store] as of July 3, 2008.  Software available on the phone suitable for advanced users and developers but not the average consumer. Email announcements and found on the [http://lists.openmoko.org/mailman/listinfo/announce announce mailing list]. For frequently asked questions please check [[FAQ]]. Approximately, twice a month an Openmoko team member writes an update to the project at [[Community Updates]].

== Intended use and users ==

The Neo FreeRunner is a Linux-based touch screen smart phone aimed at general consumer use as well as Linux desktop users and software developers.

General phone users will eventually appreciate the high spec and performance of the phone and the wide range of free and custom software packages that you are free to install to make the maximum use of the hardware for your particular needs. 
It will not be suitable for end users at release.
Note that software tweaks and improvements will continue after launch as both the Openmoko team developers and the wider linux community work together.

Linux users and software developers will appreciate the total freedom they have to use and design software for the FreeRunner

== Specifications ==

The specs share some features with the previous [[Neo1973]] such as:

* A very high resolution touch screen (1.7" x 2.27" - 43mm x 58mm) 480x640 pixels
* 128MB SDRAM memory to allow operation of many applications at once
* Internal GPS module for map and tracking programs
* Bluetooth for local data exchange
* Physical appearance will be the same as the Neo1973. See openmoko.com for more.

but will gain the additional features of:

* 802.11 b/g WiFi for fast web browsing and data transfer
* A faster 400Mhz processor (up from 266MHz)
* A hardware Graphics Accelerator chip allowing the acceleration of a limited set of operations.
** Unfortunately, this is on a shared slow (7M/s) bus with the SD card.
* 2 3D accelerometers so that the phone can know its orientation for example switching to landscape mode automatically
* 2 LEDs illuminating the two buttons on the rim of the case (one bi color [blue|orange] behind the power button, 1 uni color [red] behind the aux button)
* Tri-band GSM and GPRS for North America (850/1800/1900 Mhz) and the rest of the world (900/1800/1900 Mhz)
* USB Host function with 500mA power allowing you to power USB devices for short periods (will drain the FreeRunner battery faster)
