== What is the price? ==

The device is being sold through multiple channels (including [http://www.openmoko.com Openmoko.com]), the official price has been set to 399$ but it could slightly vary in some countries (due to taxes).

== Intended use and users ==

The Neo FreeRunner is a Linux-based touch screen smart phone ultimately aimed at general consumer use as well as Linux desktop users and software developers.

Linux users and software developers will appreciate the total freedom they have to use and design software for the FreeRunner.

General phone users will eventually appreciate the high spec and performance of the phone and the wide range of free software packages expected to emerge. These will allow users to make the maximum use of the hardware and tailor it to their particular needs. Since launch, the pace of software tweaks and improvements has increased as both the Openmoko team developers and the wider community work together.

== How usable is it? ==

As the hacker's dream toy: it is fully functional. As a GSM phone: some people have been using it to receive and place phone calls and SMS for months, but with currently shipping software the battery life is only one day. As a GPS device: critical bugs have been ironed out and there is nice software to know where you are using OpenStreetMap. As an alarm clock, media player, internet browser, game console, email reader and contacts manager: software is not stable yet.

If you want a fully functional smart phone, then download the [[Qtopia]] distribution. If you want to help OM develop it's end user applications, then download [[Om 2008.8|2008.8]]. It's still "Alpha", which means its not feature complete, but it will give you an idea of the direction we are headed. Read more about these and other [[Distributions|distributions]], then choose for yourself.
