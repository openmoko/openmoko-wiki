== Finding out status before FreeRunner is released ==

To be emailed when it is released sign up to the announce mail list here http://lists.openmoko.org/mailman/listinfo/announce.    For frequently asked questions please check [[FAQ]].     Approximately, twice a month an Openmoko team member writes an update to the project here [[Community Updates]].

No official launch date will be given until the phone is ready.

== Intended use and users ==

The Neo FreeRunner is a GNU/Linux based touch screen smart phone aimed at general consumer use as well as GNU/Linux desktop users and GNU/Linux software developers.

General phone users will appreciate the high spec and performance of the phone and the wide range of free and custom software packages that you are free to install to make the maximum use of the hardware for your particular needs. Note that software tweaks and improvements will continue after launch as both the Openmoko team developers and the wider linux community work together.

GNU/Linux users and software developers will appreciate the total freedom they have to use and design software for the FreeRunner
