== Unison File Synchronizer ==

[http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison Unison] is a file-synchronization tool for Unix and Windows. See the  [http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/download/releases/stable/unison-manual.html manual] for a detailed look at it's capabilities.

Unison comes in two flavors:
* Text mode only version (debian package name: unison)
* GTK-based graphical version (debian package name: unison-gtk)

Unison can sync 
* between two directory trees on the same computer or 
* between directory trees on two separate machines.
For syncing desktop machine and neo we use the latter. The recommended way to do this is the [http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/download/releases/stable/unison-manual.html#rshmeth remote shell method]:
We start unison or unison-gtk on the desktop pc. The program will connect to the neo via ssh an start a text-only unison on the neo to retrieve new files or deltas and to modify files on the neo.
