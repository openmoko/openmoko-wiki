=Efforts Toward Marketing the GTA04=

In the circles I've been in, this is called "outreach." We're trying to get excited about a product here so I'll just go with the much more used term, "marketing."

I am not a marketing expert by any means. I only wish to throw ideas out there and implement what I have time for. If there are any marketing experts, heck, if you're even just interested) please help out! Please post more places where we can send a press release or start a discussion. Anyone can do this. When starting the discussion or writing a press release, the only experience you really need is the ability to write in your native language. I'm only familiar with English sources but anything will work.

==Discussion points / significant features==

# The GTA04 *requires* an FR / NEO1974. <br>This should serve as a request to get people who have these collecting dust, selling them online. Maybe this should be made more explicit?
# The GTA04 has vastly improved on every area of the FR. <br> Assure no bugs to receiving calls, GPU bottlenecks solved etc... 
# The GTA04 is made in a proper factory in the EU, and of quality parts, in small runs - hence the price tag. <br>This will appeal to those of us who want things done right, not cheap.
# Though there are non-free chunks, harm has been reduced as much as possible. <br> Talking about how the wifi firmware has been isolated so it cannot interfere with the O/S is a great example.

==Mailing Lists==

This area cannot be done with a press release blast. Well it can, but I don't think the subscribers will appreciate spam. Ideally each of us can write a post about the GTA04 on any other FOSS lists we are on.
