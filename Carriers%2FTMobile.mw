== T-Mobile ==

A cursory glance on [http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/plans http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/plans at 08:58 UTC 2007-07-26] indicated that without entering zip code data two types of plans are available.  2-year contract plans (I think you have to talk to some for the 1 year plans) and Prepaid plans.

== Contract Plans ==
* 08:58 UTC 2007-07-26 It seemed to me all there contract plans are 2 year terms unless you try to get one by calling or visiting a store [http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/plans/ "For a 1-year contract, call 1-877-387-4324 or visit one of our T-Mobile stores" at the bottom of the page]
* 08:58 UTC 2007-07-26 They have either Individual/Regular Individual/MyFav Family/Regular or Family/MyFav plans
* 08:58 UTC 2007-07-26 Mobile To Mobile "...Note: Service in North and South Carolina, Iowa (area codes 319, 563, and 712), Wisconsin (area code 608), and Michigan (area code 906) is provided by T-Mobile roaming partners so calls will not be rated as mobile-to-mobile in these areas. Calls from or to locations outside of the US will not be rated as mobile-to-mobile."
* Needs more info..


== Prepaid Plans ==
[http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/plans/Default.aspx?plancategory=4 http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/plans/Default.aspx?plancategory=4]
* 08:58 UTC 2007-07-26 Unpleasantly they have a gold status that gives one different refill values than normal users.
* 08:58 UTC 2007-07-26 I expect those that expend large amounts of money get gold status.

08:58 UTC 2007-07-26 If you buy the $100 you get the gold crap 
    and your minutes don't expire for a year but I bet there's tricky small print. ''All that I could see was the $10 activation charge. - 2007-08-01''
* 08:58 UTC 2007-07-26 You lose your number after 90 days of no service...  "...To keep your mobile number active, refill within 90 days after your minutes expire. After 90 days, your account will be canceled and you will lose your phone number. If you want to restart service, you will need to activate new service."

* '''Inside Information:''' If you want to buy prepaid plans, it is best to go with the $100 gold plan. The catch is there is a $10 activation fee, so you end up paying $110 to get a SIM card with 1000 minutes valid for 1 year. Their base line phone is $30 (2007-08-01) if you want a backup phone.

* Look into the T-Mobile Flex plan: Pay as you go $39.99 for 1000 minutes, evenings and weekends free!  No contracts (or so the salesman said).  Still costs $20 to buy a sim card from the store.

== Data Access Plans ==

* T-Mobile does not offer data plans on pre-pay accounts ''Information from T-Mobile Store in the US on 2007-08-01''

* FIXME: Add information here
