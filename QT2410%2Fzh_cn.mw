Armzone QT2410

The armzone.com qt2410 is a 90% compatible chinese remake of Samsungs SMDK2410.  Unfortunately it's only 90% compatible, not 100% - and those 10% difference are only marginally documented.

== 概述 ==

QT2410包含主板(Mainboard)和核心板(Kernel board). 核心板通过一个144脚的SDRAM插座插入主板.

== Boot Selection ==

QT2410有一个位于主板的512k字节的NOR flash(SST39VF400A)和一个位于核心板的64MB NAND flash (Samsung K9F1208U0B).核心板有一个小开关来决定是从NAND flash启动还是从NOR flash 启动.

== USB Downloader in NOR ==

The NOR flash is pre-programmed with a small program called "S3C2410X USB Downloader ver 0.2".  This program listens on the usb device port for some software download.  After the download has finished, it will jump to the code it has just downloaded.

The original QT2410 ships some bogus windows program to send software to the board.  [[User:HaraldWelte]] has written some code called [[s3c2410_boot_usb]] to interface the USB downloader from a Linux host.

== JTAG flashing ==

The NAND and NOR flash can be flashed via JTAG.  This is discouraged by all means, since it is extremely time-consuming. Samsung / Armzone ship (again) a windows based program for flashing, called sjf2410.
[[User:HaraldWelte]] has done a Linux port of sjf2410, called [[sjf2410-linux]].  Using it you can re-program the [[Bootloader]] into NAND in case something strange happened.


== Memory Layout ==

=== NAND ===
The 64MB NAND Flash is partitioned as follows:

 0x00000000: u-boot, 196kByte (can shrink later, lots of debug code)
 0x00030000: u-boot environment, 16kByte (cannot shrink, 16k erase size of NAND)
 0x00034000: kernel, 2MB (0x200000 bytes)
 0x00234000: initrd, 4MB (0x400000 bytes)
 0x00634000: jffs2, 59,184kB (0x39cc000 bytes)
 0x03ffffff: end

=== Physical ===

 0x00000000: [[S3C2410 Steppingstone]]
 0x19000300: CS8900A Ethernet
 0x30000000: SDRAM start
 0x30000100: Arm-Tag "ATAG" structure passing from bootloader to kernel
 0x30008000: Default load address for decompressed kernel
 0x32000000: Default load address for compressed kernel u-boot image
 0x33d00000: Default frame buffer start address
 0x33d4b000: Default frame buffer end address (240x320, 16bpp)
 0x33f5f000: MALLOC_BASE of u-boot
 0x33f80000: TEXT_BASE of u-boot
 0x33ffffff: End of RAM
