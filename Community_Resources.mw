=== Wiki ===

This Wiki is our public wiki, http://wiki.openmoko.org/. You're already in it, if you're reading this. Due to continued defacements/spam we were forced to limit editing in this wiki to registered users which provide a working email address. Sorry for that.

=== Trac ===

Our bug ticketing and documentation system for software issues is available at http://trac.openmoko.org/.  This obsoleted the previously used bugzilla installation which was found at http://bugzilla.openmoko.org/.

=== IRC ===

There's a #openmoko channel on irc.freenode.net: irc://irc.freenode.net/openmoko

If you experience any build problems and need help from other developers, it is important that you share your complete output log. To share your output log, just paste it to [http://www.pastebin.ca/ pastebin] after submitting it, paste the resulting URL to the IRC channel.

Thanks to the NSLU2-Linux project, we also have the IRC logs available.
Current 24h live log is always at: http://logs.nslu2-linux.org/livelogs/openmoko.txt

Previous 24h log is always at: http://logs.nslu2-linux.org/livelogs/openmoko-prev.txt

=== Git Server ===

The new official set of repositories for [[OpenEmbedded]] as well as Linux [[kernel]], X.org and other used projects can be found at http://git.openmoko.org/, browsable via gitweb.

=== Projects ===

At http://projects.openmoko.org/ we have a GForge installation.  Users can use this as hosting service for their contributed applications.

== Internal resources ==

There are some resources which are internal.  This means that they are only available for internal developers of Openmoko Inc.   The reason they are internal is either because they deal with information under NDA, or about business strategy.  We kindly ask for your understanding that while we really try to be as open as possible, there are some topics which we have to discuss without public participation.

The internal systems have the domain ''*.internal.openmoko.org''.

=== IRC ===

The #openmoko-devel channel is for internal developers only, sorry.

== Local Community ==

See the [[OpenMoko_Local_Groups|OpenMoko Local Groups]]

== Private repositories and branches ==

Some members of the community have published their copy of the openmoko repository with private or not-yet-applied changes.
