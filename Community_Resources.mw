See [[Discussion Forums]]. There is very little activity at the [http://forums.makeopensource.com/ The Unofficial OpenMoko Forums], but others forums are more busy.

== Git Servers ==

The new official set of repositories for [[OpenEmbedded]] as well as Linux [[kernel]], X.org and other used projects can be found at http://git.openmoko.org/, browsable via gitweb.

'''Currently''' (02/2009) the only active ones are qi, kernel and xf86-video-glamo.git. Everything else has moved to upstream git.openembedded.net, see [[OpenEmbedded]] for more information.

To get access to git.openmoko.org, see instructions on using trac to ask for access in the mailing list post http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/devel/2009-February/004563.html.

=== Personal repositories and branches ===

Some members of the community have published their copy of the openmoko repository with private or not-yet-applied changes.

== IRC ==

There is always a good group in the IRC channel '''#openmoko on FreeNode'''. If you aren't an IRC-er, you might want to review the discussions anyways:

* [http://logs.nslu2-linux.org/livelogs/openmoko.txt Current 24h live log]
* [http://logs.nslu2-linux.org/livelogs/openmoko-prev.txt Previous 24h log]

Within the time contstraints of middle Europe, the Freenode channel #neo1973-germany is also active and members switch to english on demand.

In addition to the general channel '''#openmoko''' there is a community developers channel '''#openmoko-cdevel''' on irc.freenode.net: irc://irc.freenode.net/openmoko-cdevel. The '''#openmoko-devel''' channel is for Openmoko Inc. internal developers only, sorry. 

If you experience any build problems and need help from other developers, it is important that you share your complete output log. To share your output log, just paste it to [http://www.pastebin.ca/ pastebin] after submitting it, paste the resulting URL to the IRC channel.

== Mailing Lists ==

There are several [http://lists.openmoko.org/mailman/listinfo/ Mailing lists]. Archives of these lists can be searched with [http://openmoko.markmail.org/ Markmail]. There is a [http://lists.openmoko.org/nabble.html Nabble web interface] to read and post to the lists.

You should ask for help on the [https://lists.openmoko.org/mailman/listinfo/support support mailing list].

The [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/ openmoko community mailing list] is perhaps the most active.
As of July 2008, its volume amounts to dozens of messages per day. Openmoko people are there too. When posting about a specific distribution, please start the subject line with its name between bracket: [FSO], [2008.9]...

Lots of Debian and FSO discussions among the pkg-fso team takes place on the [http://lists.linuxtogo.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/smartphones-userland Smartphones-userland] list.

If you feel uncomfortable using mailing lists, you can use [http://gmane.org gmane] forum-like interface.

== Openmoko Inc. Internal Resources ==

There are some resources which are internal.  This means that they are only available for internal developers of Openmoko Inc.   The reason they are internal is either because they deal with information under NDA, or about business strategy.  We kindly ask for your understanding that while we really try to be as open as possible, there are some topics which we have to discuss without public participation.

The internal systems have the domain ''*.internal.openmoko.org''.

== Projects Hosting ==

At http://projects.openmoko.org/ we have a GForge installation.  Users can use this as hosting service for their contributed applications.

== Trac / Bug Reporting ==

Our bug ticketing and documentation system for software issues is available at http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/.  This obsoleted the previously used bugzilla installation which was found at http://bugzilla.openmoko.org/.
Admin team has extra trac system: http://admin-trac.openmoko.org/trac/intertrac/.
