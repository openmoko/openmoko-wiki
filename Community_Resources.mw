== Internal resources ==

There are some resources which are internal.  This means that they are only available for internal developers of FIC / Openmoko Inc.   The reason they are internal is either because they deal with information under NDA, or about business strategy.  We kindly ask for your understanding that while we really try to be as open as possible, there are some topics which we have to discuss without public
participation.

Nontheless, contrary to traditional security beliefs, we'll outline here what those resources are.

=== Mailing Lists ===

Those are for FIC / OpenMoko employees and external partners/contractors/cunsultants only.
