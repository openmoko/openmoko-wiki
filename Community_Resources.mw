== Wiki ==

This Wiki is our internal wiki, http://wiki.internal.openmoko.org/. You're already in it, if you're reading this.

There is another wiki (with very little content so far) which will be the public wiki once the product is released at http://wiki.openmoko.org/

== Bugzilla ==

Our bug tracking system for software issues (which will become public at product release time) is available at http://bugzilla.openmoko.org/

Our internal bug tracking system, mainly for hardware issues, is available at http://bugzilla.internal.openmoko.org/

== SVN ==
There is a [http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion] server available at svn.openmoko.org. 

Read-only access is provided via http://svn.openmoko.org/. You should not normally use this URL, it's mainly for later public access after product release.

Read-write access for developers is provided via https://svn.openmoko.org:2342

Web access for occasional browsing is available via http://svnweb.openmoko.org/

If you need help, please read more about [[Using Subversion]].
