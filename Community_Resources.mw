== Openmoko Inc. Internal Resources ==

There are some resources which are internal.  This means that they are only available for internal developers of Openmoko Inc.   The reason they are internal is either because they deal with information under NDA, or about business strategy.  We kindly ask for your understanding that while we really try to be as open as possible, there are some topics which we have to discuss without public participation.

The internal systems have the domain ''*.internal.openmoko.org''.

== Projects Hosting ==

At http://projects.openmoko.org/ we have a GForge installation.  Users can use this as hosting service for their contributed applications.

== Trac / Bug Reporting ==

Our bug ticketing and documentation system for software issues is available at http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/.  This obsoleted the previously used bugzilla installation which was found at http://bugzilla.openmoko.org/.
Admin team has extra trac system: http://admin-trac.openmoko.org/trac/intertrac/.
