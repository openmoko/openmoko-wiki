== Boston Freerunner Users! ==

There are eight of us, in Downtown Boston with a Freerunner. Of the 8, six of us are likely to do some hacking on it. Currently, 6 phones are running Qtopia, and two phones are running whatever comes out of the box, but likely to be flashed with Qtopia next week.

Would other Freerunner users in the area be interested in a meetup? We have a conference room in our office and the ability to make large cups of reasonable tasting coffee.

I've got a Freerunner, and a neo1973, in Cambridge, and have written some code for them. I run 2007.2 on the neo1973, and 2008.8 on the FR, but will probably switch to FSO soon. I think a meetup would be fun.

I believe I'm one of the eight that are mentioned, and I'd be into it as well - I just wrote up my initial thoughts and what projects I am interested on working on at first on my user page (see following link). Oh, and if I was included in the 6 Qtopia, then -1 Qtopia / +1 Dual boot FSO / Debian+FSO :-)

I'm pretty sure I'm not in the 8 mentioned - but I am in metro-Boston. I'd be interested in a meetup. I run OM2008.8 now... but who knows for tomorrow. [[User:Candrews|Candrews]] 20:49, 11 September 2008 (UTC)

I'm another Freerunner owner. I live in the Worcester area, but work in Waltham. I'm running 2008.8 most of the time, but have played with Debian, and may well switch once Illume is available on Debian. I've gotten a small Java app to run on my phone, but will probably end up hacking in Python or C.
