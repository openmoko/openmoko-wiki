Multi-touch demo at http://cs.nyu.edu/~jhan/ftirtouch/index.html is
cool. However these are just first steps on the mountain of
inventions that are possible with multi-touch.

<aloril>    hmm.. 3D multi gesture ...
<aloril>    2 high resolution cameras and .. ;-)
<PirateHead>        and then suddenly using your cellphone looks like
casting spells in old fantasy fic flicks

Fully utilized potential of even 2D only pressure sensitive
multi-gestures that can detect different fingers might look like somebody
is weaving spell(s). Probably most of time fingers would touch screen
with varying strengths.

Here is one quick idea: Use middle finger to enter text using something
like http://www.strout.net/info/ideas/hexinput.html .  Use index finger
to change mode to text entry/ search (file/google/wiki)/ cut/ paste/
move/ etc...  A bit like vim, except both modes (and more modes) are
available at the same time. Thumb could be used for some additional
modes. For example change entry mode from letters to most common
syllables or to most common words or depending on mode to most common
movements, etc.. This of course still doesn't fully utilize potential of
even 3 fingers.

Above is just one quick idea of what is possible.

With full 60cm*60cm (about 24") pressure sensitive multi-touch screen
that could recognize different fingers uniquely you could probably input
faster utilizing all 10 fingers in spell weaving than any traditional
keyboard + mouse can do. However learning full potential might require
multi year full time training to become competent wizard in spell
weaving ;-) 

You might want to also utilize some 3D potential too, tough full 3D
might be quite tiring.

It seems that Neo1973 v1 is single touch only. Maybe its still possible to
have limited fake multi touch. Software could recognize that average
point suddenly jumped and correctly deduce where second finger
touched/gestured. More might be possible by using some 'black magic'.
