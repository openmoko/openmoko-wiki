	
== GPE: Calendar ==

Full featured calendar application available in most of the openmoko repositories. It was not designed directly for openmoko and finger navigation thus it brings along some drawbacks when using it, but most of the drawbacks can be worked around.

Features:
* recurring events (daily, workdays, weekends, monthly, yearly)
* alarms (with <tt>atd</tt>, even when Freerunner is turned off - in such case it will start up and fire the alarm)
* entries without due-time, just a note for a particular day
* different view modes (day, week, month, agenda)
* multiple calendars
* mimedir (vCal, iCal) data import/export

=== Problems and workarounds ===

Problems (on SHR-testing of 2009-03-03):
# alarms need <tt>atd</tt> - this is not available in SHR testing, but it can be installed from openmoko repository (see below). in SHR unstable <tt>atd-over-fso</tt> is available, hopefully it should also work.
# <tt>atd</tt> script does not run gpe-calendar if gpe-calendar is not running
# alarm sound needs /dev/dsp
# alarm sound needs esd
# alarm sound level is too high
# closing gpe-calendar window does not close the application

===== Workarounds (on SHR-testing of 2009-03-03): =====
;ad problem 1
:<pre>opkg install http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/Om2008.8/armv4t/atd_0.70-r4_armv4t.opk</pre>
;ad problem 2
:this can be worked around using a bug in gpe-calendar :-) If gpe-calendar is run without a full path on the command line, like this <pre>$ gpe-calendar &</pre>then it prepares the <tt>atd</tt> script with current directory as its full path. we can thus make a script that will be run by <tt>atd</tt> instead of gpe-calendar and this script can actually run the calendar:
:* <pre>mkdir $HOME/.gpe</pre>
:* copy [[#.24HOME.2F.gpe.2Fgpe-calendar|gpe-calendar]] script to <tt>$HOME/.gpe/</tt>
:* <pre>chmod 755 $HOME/.gpe/gpe-calendar</pre>
:* copy [[#.2Fusr.2Fshare.2Fapplications.2Fgpe-calendar.desktop|gpe-calendar.desktop]] to <tt>/usr/share/applications</tt> to run gpe-calendar from the workaround directory
;ad problem 3
:<pre>echo snd-pcm-oss > /etc/modutils/dev_dsp; update-modules; modprobe snd-pcm-oss</pre>
;ad problem 4
:
:* <pre>opkg install esd</pre>
:* copy [[#.2Fetc.2Finit.d.2Fesd|esd]] to <tt>/etc/init.d/</tt> (esd package does not contain an init script?)
:* <pre>/etc/init.d/esd start</pre>
;ad problem 5
:the alarm sound level should be configurable in <tt>$HOME/.gpe/alarm.conf</tt>, but gpe-calendar ignores the level settings there :-(
:a small (not fully satisfactory) workaround to this is contained in the [[#.24HOME.2F.gpe.2Fgpe-calendar|gpe-calendar]] script described above, which sets the volume with <tt>amixer</tt> before running gpe-calendar
;ad problem 6
:the only possible workaround to this would probably need a recompilation of the package. so far, when you close the gpe-calendar window, it only "iconifies", e.i. goes away, but appears when switching tasks. The main problem of this state is, that when you shut down the phone, enlightenment waits for all running tasks and after 15s it complains about gpe-calendar not wanting to exit. so the only current solution is to quit gpe-calendar from its menu with File->Quit.
