= ADB : Android debug bridge =
To assist in debugging and to gain shell access to the phone with Android, you can use

   [http://people.openmoko.org/sean_mcneil/adb adb]

== Connecting ==

You should be able to connect to the phone as long as you start it up with the USB connected to your host. I don't think it will work if you plug it in after starting. Of course, you need to setup [[USB_Networking]] (<tt>ifconfig usb0</tt> ...) on your host before connecting.

Sometimes, adb gets stuck: if you cannot to the device run "adb kill-server" before trying other commands.

If Adb cannot find any device:
Make sure you can ping the device. Kill the background running adb-server by "adb kill-server" and start your first adb instance (which starts the background process) with "ADBHOST=192.168.0.202 ./adb devices". After that, you can run adb without ADBHOST-Variable.


Some helpful commands are:

    ./adb logcat           - like a tail -f of the android log
    ./adb logcat -b radio  - same as above for the radio logs
    ./adb shell            - bring up a command shell to the phone
    ./adb kill-server      - kill the background server on the host
    ./adb install app.apk  - install app.apk on the phone


== Fixing startup problems ==
Startup problems (Beta2): adb shell to the device and delete /data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases/settings.db
