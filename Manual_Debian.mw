This page is to explain how to run Debian armel port on Openmoko devices.  You can do this from scratch, or download a prebuilt file system.
The former will take some time, perhaps 2 hours, depending on your internet connection

= Prebuilt Filesystem =

Download and extract to an ext2/ext3 formatted filesystem on your SD card:

 wget http://rabenfrost.net/debian/debian-armel-xfce.tar.bz2

Note that the above is just a bit too big to fit on a 512MB SD card.  A smaller image will soon be provided.

Access via SSH is much the same as under other images using [[USB Networking]], with the user accounts below:

* root password: openmoko
* First user and password: openmoko

Note: If you upgrade your your debian and your touchscreen doesn't work any more, you most likely have to adjust /etc/udev/rules.d/50-udev.rules by applying the settings described later in this document for /etc/udev/udev.rules

== (Optional) Install Known Good Kernel ==

This kernel was build by Marcel_M and has some important patches in it such as removed sd debug symbols and build-in ext3 support.

 wget http://rabenfrost.net/celtune/uImage-2.6.24+svnr4194-r4165-r3-neo1973.bin
 ./dfu-util -d 0x1457:0x5119 -a kernel -R -D ./uImage-2.6.24+svnr4194-r4165-r3-neo1973.bin

Question: is this kernel for Neo1973/GTA01 only? Is there a good/recommended kernel for Freerunner/GTA02?

Use a new image kernel from :"http://buildhost.openmoko.org/daily/freerunner/", it works fine ;)

== (Optional) Recompiling Kernel to Add Drivers ==
(Based on http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/support/2008-August/001240.html)

Steps to build the kernel standalone with the "moredrivers" config (to get additional drivers, such as the usb tether drivers that were moved out as kernel modules, compiled directly into the kernel).

  ~ - git clone git://git.openmoko.org/git/kernel.git linux-2.6
  ~ - cd linux-2.6
  ~ - git checkout origin/stable
  ~ - edit ./build to point to your compiler path
  ~ - cp defconfig-2.6.24 .config
  ~ - ./build

That gets you a uImage.bin you can DFU or copy into your SD Card filesystem.

== Configure booting from SD/SDHC ==

Do as proposed here: [[Booting_from_SD]]

Note that these instructions are in need a rewrite.

= Build your own armel filesystem =

== (Option 1) debootstrap your rootfs on Debian or Ubuntu host ==

 debootstrap --verbose --arch armel --foreign sid ./armel-chroot http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/

== (option 2) download ready to use armel rootfs ==

If you don't have debootstrap on your system you can download the results here:

 wget http://rabenfrost.net/debian/armel-chroot-first-stage.tar.gz

== Prepare SD card ==

ssh to your neo and format your sd card appropriately. I'm using an 8GB SDHC card here.

:''NOTE: it might be a good idea not to use ext3. This is because ext3 is a heavily journalising file system and on the freerunner (sd card) might cause premature death of the card. It is recommened you use ext2 or another similar file system. One also will need a vfat or ext2 (only vfat worked for me with the stock u-boot for the freerunner. On which to place the kernel to boot off. See the [[Booting_from_SD]] If you have not done so already.''

 fdisk /dev/mmcblk0
 We will now create a 8 mb partition for our kernel and another one for the rootfs which will take up all the   
 remaining space.

copy the armel chroot to your device by tar'ing it to circumvent symbolic link cycles (https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1059 <= WONTFIX)

 tar -C ./armel-chroot/ -c . | ssh root@192.168.0.202 tar -C /media/card -xv
or if you downloaded the archive

 cat armel-chroot-first-stage.tar.gz | ssh root@192.168.0.202 tar -C /media/card -xzvf -

== Complete debootstrap Process ==

ssh to your device and execute the following commands (just copypaste everything below)

 echo "nameserver 192.168.0.200" > /media/card/etc/resolv.conf
 echo "fic-gta01" > /media/card/etc/hostname
 echo "127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost fic-gta01" > /media/card/etc/hosts
 echo -e "auto lo\n\

 tmpfs   /var/tmp         tmpfs   defaults,noatime                   0 0" > /media/card/etc/fstab
now chroot into your armel rootfs and finish the install
 chroot /media/card
 /debootstrap/debootstrap --second-stage
make sure your internal clock is set to the correct date because aptitude will complain if otherwise (does not work on the gta02 at the moment: "Cannot access the Hardware Clock via any known method.")
 hwclock --set --date="MM/DD/YY hh:mm:ss"
install openssh so you can login remotely
 echo "deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian sid main" > /etc/apt/sources.list
 aptitude update
 aptitude upgrade
 aptitude install openssh-server
install and configure locales
 aptitude install locales
 dpkg-reconfigure locales
install udev to dynamically create /dev
 aptitude install udev
set a root password
 passwd
create a normal user
 adduser <yournamehere>

== Get X Running ==
Now reboot and start Debian. Login with ssh and start configuring xorg:

 aptitude install xorg

configure /etc/X11/xorg.conf so that it looks like this:

 Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier      "Configured Mouse"
        Driver          "mouse"
        Option          "Device" "/dev/input/mice"
 EndSection
 Section "Device"
        Identifier      "Configured Video Device"
        Driver          "fbdev"
 EndSection
 Section "Monitor"
        Identifier      "Configured Monitor"
 EndSection
 Section "Screen"
        Identifier      "Default Screen"
        Monitor         "Configured Monitor"
 EndSection
 Section "ServerLayout"
        Identifier      "Default Layout"
        Screen          "Default Screen"
        InputDevice     "Configured Mouse"
 EndSection
Start X in the first vt:
 startx -- vt1

== Get touchscreen working ==
Install the tslib driver:

 aptitude install xserver-xorg-input-tslib

and edit the InputDevice section in your xorg.conf

 Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier "Configured Mouse"
        Driver "tslib"
        Option "CorePointer"
        Option "TslibDevice" "/dev/input/event1"
        Option "Protocol" "Auto"
 EndSection
calibrate your touchscreen
for gta01:
 echo -67 36365 -2733100 -48253 -310 45219816 65536 > /etc/pointercal

calibration for the gta02
 echo  -67 38667 -4954632 -51172 121 46965312 65536 > /etc/pointercal

Note from Tkrahn:

First the above calibration for gta02 worked fine for me, but after a 
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade the pointer didn't follow the stylo
anymore. I needed to overwrite /etc/udev/rules.d/50-udev.rules with 
/etc/udev/udev.rules.dpkg-bak and a restart of the X server to get it 
moving again. But then the pointer was very far off from the tip of 
the stylo. Obviously the mode how the calculation of the position worked
has changed with the upgrade. I changed the calibration empirically. 
The following /etc/pointercal parameters worked for me:

 0 80000 -8000000 -80500 0 74500000 65536

(On GATA02v5 after the upgrade!)


Start X and enjoy!
 startx -- vt1

== Install GDM and xfce4 ==

 aptitude install gdm xfce4 xvkbd

Configure gdm so xkvbd will allow you to put in your username and password. simply add this to the end of /etc/gdm/Init/Default before exit 0 so that the three last lines look like this:

 fi
 sleep 20 && /usr/bin/xvkbd -xdm -compact -geometry 480x210+0+0 &
 exit 0

Simply click on the focus button of xvkbd and then on the input box of GDM to input your user name and password there.  On each boot gdm should start automatically now.

If you like you can also download a correctly sized Debian wallpaper I generated from the SVG source for 480x640:

 wget <nowiki>http://rabenfrost.net/debian/debian-blueish-wallpaper-480x640.png</nowiki> -O /usr/share/images/desktop-base/desktop-background

== Clean Up ==
 aptitude clean

== Load Additional Kernel Modules ==

These are for sound, bluetooth and USB. Use the modules archive that fits to your kernel.

 wget http://rabenfrost.net/celtune/modules-2.6.24+svnr4194-r4165-r3-neo1973.tgz
 tar -xf modules-2.6.24+svnr4194-r4165-r3-neo1973.tgz -C /
 depmod -a
 echo -e "hci_usb\n\
 hidp\n\
 ohci-hcd\n\
 rfcomm\n\
 snd-mixer-oss\n\
 snd-pcm-oss\n\
 snd-soc-neo1973-wm8753" > /etc/modules

Note: On the Freerunner, the sound module (on the last line) is called snd-soc-neo1973-gta02-wm8753
[[Image:Sonata.png|480px|''Sonata on neo1973'']]
== Enable Sound ==

Now we turn our Debian into a jukebox!

 aptitude install alsa-base
 wget http://rabenfrost.net/celtune/alsa_state_files-working.tar.gz
 tar -xf alsa_state_files-working.tar.gz -C /etc
 alsactl -f /etc/alsa_state_files-working/stereoout.state restore
 addgroup openmoko audio

I currently use mpd+sonata - let me know if you know another nice lightweight gtk player. Unfortunately RhythmBox is way too much for the Neo to handle - the MP3 playing stops after 20secs.

= Using a keyboard =
[[Image:Debian+frogpad.jpg|480px|''Using irssi on [[Debian]] together with the frogpad to IRC on #neo1973-germany'']]
nezza prepared a nice guide for this here: [[Frogpad]]

= Chroot installation =

If you just want to run random debian programs without completely booting to debian you can use the following minimal steps:

on desktop:

 sudo debootstrap --arch armel --foreign sid sid
 sudo tar cjf sid.tar.bz2 sid
 nc -w3 -lp1234 < sid-arm.tar.bz2

on neo:

 cd /media/card
 nc 192.168.0.200 1234 | tar -x -j -f -
 mount -t none -o bind /dev /media/card/sid/dev
 mount -t none -o bind /proc /media/card/sid/proc
 mount -t none -o bind /sys /media/card/sid/sys
 mount -t none -o bind /tmp /media/card/sid/tmp
 chroot /media/card/sid /deboostrap/deboostrap --second-stage
 cp /etc/resolv.conf /media/card/sid
 chroot /media/card/sid apt-get update
 chroot /media/card/sid apt-get install mplayer
 chroot /media/card/sid mplayer http://relay.slayradio.org:8000/


=For X applications / xserver on the Freerunner=

Copy /usr/bin/Xglamo (and /usr/bin/Xfbdev) to  /usr/bin in Debian from FSO/ASU/2007.2/2008.8.

Add this to your .bashrc (to tell tslib to use the correct input device):
 export TSLIB_TSDEVICE=/dev/input/event1

The X server binaries are linked against version 1 of tslib, for some reason Debian calls its version 0, even though it actually is version 1. Symlink the library to the alternative name by running (as root):
 ln -s /usr/lib/libts-0.0.so.0 /usr/lib/libts-1.0.so.0

We also need to change the symlink for the X server to either Xfbdev or Xglamo (this should better be handled by update-alternatives!):
 cd /usr/bin && mv X X.orig && ln -s Xfbdev X
(replace Xfbdev by Xglamo if you want to use that, Xglamo is faster, but rotation still does not work correctly as of 2008-08-12).

=GPS=

Install gpsd and an application like [[TangoGPS]] on Debian:

 (as root)
 apt-get install gpsd
 apt-get install tangogps

Unlike on OM 2008.8 the serial port for gps is not /dev/ttySAC1 but /dev/s3c2410_serial1. 
The best way to set up gpsd on Debian is to use dpkg-reconfigure:
 dpkg-reconfigure gpsd
Now use the parameters:
 Start gpsd automatically on boot? Yes
 Device the GPS receiver is attached to: /dev/s3c2410_serial1
 Should gpsd handle attached USB GPS receivers automatically? No
 Options to gpsd: (leave empty, just hit return)

Test the serial connection to the GPS chip:
 echo 0 > /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-0/0-0073/neo1973-pm-gps.0/pwron &&  sleep 1s && echo 1 > /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-0/0-0073/neo1973-pm-gps.0/pwron && stty -F /dev/s3c2410_serial1 -echo && cat -u /dev/s3c2410_serial1 | grep -v ^$
 (Finish testing with ctrl-c)
Now you should be able to start tangogps from the X-mouse start menu:
 Start > other > GPS & Map

=Official Debian Port=

An official Debian port based on the FSO image is being created. First information can be found at http://wiki.debian.org/pkg-fso. Early adopters are welcome.
