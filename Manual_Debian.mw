This page is to explain how to run Debian armel port on Openmoko devices.  You can do this from scratch, or download a prebuilt file system.
The former will take some time, perhaps 2 hours, depending on your internet connection

= Prebuilt Filesystem =

Download and extract to an ext2 formatted filesystem on your SD card:

 wget http://rabenfrost.net/debian/debian-armel-xfce.tar.bz2

Note that the above is just a bit too big to fit on a 512MB SD card.  A smaller image will soon be provided.

Access via SSH is much the same as under other images using [[USB Networking]], with the user accounts below:

* root password: openmoko
* First user and password: openmoko

Note: If you upgrade your your debian and your touchscreen doesn't work any more, you most likely have to adjust /etc/udev/rules.d/50-udev.rules by applying the settings described later in this document for /etc/udev/udev.rules

== (Optional) Install Known Good Kernel ==

This kernel was build by Marcel_M and has some important patches in it such as removed sd debug symbols.

 wget http://rabenfrost.net/celtune/uImage-2.6.24+svnr4194-r4165-r3-neo1973.bin
 ./dfu-util -d 0x1457:0x5119 -a kernel -R -D ./uImage-2.6.24+svnr4194-r4165-r3-neo1973.bin

This kernel doesn't work for gta02, but the kernel from Om 2008.9 works good.
http://downloads.openmoko.org/distro/releases/Om2008.9/Om2008.9-gta02-20081106.uImage.bin

== (Optional) Recompiling Kernel to Add Drivers ==
(Based on http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/support/2008-August/001240.html)

Steps to build the kernel standalone with the "moredrivers" config (to get additional drivers, such as the usb tether drivers that were moved out as kernel modules, compiled directly into the kernel).

  ~ - git clone git://git.openmoko.org/git/kernel.git linux-2.6
  ~ - cd linux-2.6
  ~ - git checkout origin/stable
  ~ - edit ./build to point to your compiler path
  ~ - cp defconfig-2.6.24 .config
  ~ - ./build

That gets you a uImage.bin you can DFU or copy into your SD Card filesystem.

== Configure booting from SD/SDHC ==

Do as proposed here: [[Booting_from_SD]]

Note that these instructions are in need a rewrite.

= Build your own armel filesystem =

== Prepare SD card ==

ssh to your neo and format your sd card appropriately. I'm using an 8GB SDHC card here.

:''NOTE: On the Freerunner one also will need a vfat or ext2 (only vfat worked for me with the stock u-boot for the freerunner) partition on which to place the kernel to boot off. See the [[Booting_from_SD]] If you have not done so already.''

 fdisk /dev/mmcblk0
 We will now create a 8 mb partition for our kernel and another one for the rootfs which will take up all the   
 remaining space.

== debootstrap on the neo ==

you can download and debootstrap natively on the neo by downloading cdebootstrap-static.

 wget http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/main/c/cdebootstrap/cdebootstrap-static_0.5.4_armel.deb
 ar -x cdebootstrap-static_0.5.4_armel.deb data.tar.gz
 tar -xz -C / -f data.tar.gz
 rm data.tar.gz cdebootstrap-static_0.5.4_armel.deb
 wget http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/main/d/debian-archive-keyring/debian-archive-keyring_2009.01.31_all.deb
 ar -x debian-archive-keyring_2009.01.31_all.deb data.tar.gz
 tar -xz -C / -f data.tar.gz
 rm data.tar.gz debian-archive-keyring_2009.01.31_all.deb
 cdebootstrap-static --flavour=minimal --include=ifupdown,udev,procps,netbase,vim-tiny,module-init-tools,wget,openssh-server,screen,apmd lenny /media/card/ http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/

justifying the included packages
* ifupdown - contains ifup, ifdown
* udev - necessary to fill /dev
* procps - contains watch, ps, kill, free, top, uptime... (otherwise this is a openssh-server dependency)
* netbase - /etc/init.d/networking
* vim-tiny - we want to edit files
* module-init-tools - modprobe, lsmod, rmmod, depmod (otherwise this is a apmd dependency)
* wget - we want to download stuff
* openssh-server - we want to connect to our device and we have enough power to not need to use dropbear
* screen - we want to operate within screen sessions so that we can disconnect or detach without problems
* apmd - suspending via apm -s

additionally interesting packages:
* vim (instead of vim-tiny)
* locale (use dpkg-reconfigure afterwards)
* less (better than more)
* curl (instead of wget)
* man-db
* rsyslog

== Complete debootstrap Process ==

execute the following commands (just copypaste everything below)
 echo "neo1973-debian" > /media/card/etc/hostname
 cat > /media/card/etc/network/interfaces <<__END__
 auto lo
 iface lo inet loopback
 auto usb0

 tmpfs   /var/tmp         tmpfs   defaults,noatime                   0 0
 __END__
 sed -i 's/\(PermitEmptyPasswords\) no/\1 yes/' /media/card/etc/ssh/sshd_config
 chroot /media/card /bin/sh -e <<__END_CHROOT__
 echo root: | chpasswd
 apt-get update
 apt-get --yes --purge remove cdebootstrap-helper-rc.d
 apt-get clean
 __END_CHROOT__

== Get X Running ==
Now reboot and start Debian. Login with ssh and start configuring xorg:

 apt-get install xorg

configure /etc/X11/xorg.conf so that it looks like this:

 cat > /etc/X11/xorg.conf << __END__
 Section "Device"
        Identifier      "Configured Video Device"
        Driver          "fbdev"
 EndSection
 __END__
Start X in the first vt:
 startx -- vt1

== Get touchscreen working ==
Install the tslib driver from debian experimental:

 echo "deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian experimental main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
 apt-get update
 apt-get install xserver-xorg-input-tslib/experimental

and edit the InputDevice section in your xorg.conf

 cat >> /etc/X11/xorg.conf << __END__
 Section "InputDevice"
         Identifier      "Configured Touchscreen"
         Driver          "tslib"
         Option          "CorePointer"           "true"
         Option          "SendCoreEvents"        "true"
         Option          "Device"                "/dev/input/event1"
         Option          "Protocol"              "Auto"
 EndSection
 __END__
calibrate your touchscreen

for gta01:
 echo -67 36365 -2733100 -48253 -310 45219816 65536 > /etc/pointercal

for gta02:
 echo  -67 38667 -4954632 -51172 121 46965312 65536 > /etc/pointercal

Start X and enjoy!
 startx -- vt1

== Install GDM and xfce4 ==

 apt-get install gdm xfce4 xvkbd

Configure gdm so xkvbd will allow you to put in your username and password. simply add this to the end of /etc/gdm/Init/Default before exit 0 so that the three last lines look like this:

 fi
 sleep 20 && /usr/bin/xvkbd -xdm -compact -geometry 480x210+0+0 &
 exit 0

Simply click on the focus button of xvkbd and then on the input box of GDM to input your user name and password there.  On each boot gdm should start automatically now.

If you like you can also download a correctly sized Debian wallpaper I generated from the SVG source for 480x640:

 wget <nowiki>http://rabenfrost.net/debian/debian-blueish-wallpaper-480x640.png</nowiki> -O /usr/share/images/desktop-base/desktop-background

== Clean Up ==
 apt-get clean

== Load Additional Kernel Modules ==

These are for sound, bluetooth and USB. Use the modules archive that fits to your kernel.

 wget http://rabenfrost.net/celtune/modules-2.6.24+svnr4194-r4165-r3-neo1973.tgz
 tar -xf modules-2.6.24+svnr4194-r4165-r3-neo1973.tgz -C /
 depmod -a
 echo -e "hci_usb\n\
 hidp\n\
 ohci-hcd\n\
 rfcomm\n\
 snd-mixer-oss\n\
 snd-pcm-oss\n\
 snd-soc-neo1973-wm8753" > /etc/modules

Note: On the FreeRunner, the sound module (on the last line) is called snd-soc-neo1973-gta02-wm8753
[[Image:Sonata.png|thumb|480px|''Sonata on neo1973'']]
== Enable Sound ==

Now we turn our Debian into a jukebox!

 apt-get install alsa-base
 wget http://rabenfrost.net/celtune/alsa_state_files-working.tar.gz
 tar -xf alsa_state_files-working.tar.gz -C /etc
 alsactl -f /etc/alsa_state_files-working/stereoout.state restore
 addgroup openmoko audio

I currently use mpd+sonata - let me know if you know another nice lightweight gtk player. Unfortunately RhythmBox is way too much for the Neo to handle - the MP3 playing stops after 20secs.

== Enable Modem ==

Here comes the phone functionality - just add this line into the "serial devices" section in your /etc/udev/rules.d/50-udev.rules

 # serial devices
 KERNEL=="s3c2410_serial[0-9]",  NAME="ttySAC%n"

= Miscellaneous =

== Chroot installation ==

If you just want to run random debian programs without completely booting to debian you can use the following minimal steps:

On desktop:

 sudo debootstrap --arch armel --foreign sid sid
 sudo tar czf sid.tar.gz sid
 nc -w 10 -l -p 1234 < sid.tar.gz

On neo:

 cd /media/card
 nc 192.168.0.200 1234 | tar xzf -
 mount -t none -o bind /dev /media/card/sid/dev
 mount -t none -o bind /proc /media/card/sid/proc
 mount -t none -o bind /sys /media/card/sid/sys
 mount -t none -o bind /tmp /media/card/sid/tmp
 chroot /media/card/sid /deboostrap/debootstrap --second-stage
 cp /etc/resolv.conf /media/card/sid/etc

On neo edit the file <tt>/media/card/sid/etc/apt/sources.list</tt> and add the following line:

 deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/ sid main non-free contrib

On neo:

 chroot /media/card/sid apt-get update
 chroot /media/card/sid apt-get install mplayer
 chroot /media/card/sid mplayer http://relay.slayradio.org:8000/


== Using Xglamo on the FreeRunner ==

Copy /usr/bin/Xglamo (and /usr/bin/Xfbdev) to  /usr/bin in Debian from FSO/ASU/2007.2/2008.8.

Add this to your .bashrc (to tell tslib to use the correct input device):
 export TSLIB_TSDEVICE=/dev/input/event1

The X server binaries are linked against version 1 of tslib, for some reason Debian calls its version 0, even though it actually is version 1. Symlink the library to the alternative name by running (as root):
 ln -s /usr/lib/libts-0.0.so.0 /usr/lib/libts-1.0.so.0

We also need to change the symlink for the X server to either Xfbdev or Xglamo (this should better be handled by update-alternatives!):
 cd /usr/bin && mv X X.orig && ln -s Xfbdev X
(replace Xfbdev by Xglamo if you want to use that, Xglamo is faster, but rotation still does not work correctly as of 2008-08-12).

== Rotating screen to landscape ==

add the following to the /etc/X11/xorg.conf in both the Device and InputDevice sections to get landscape mode

 Option          "Rotate"                "CCW"

== Hiding the cursor ==

To make the cursor invisible create a file called empty.cursor with this content:

 #define empty.cursor_width 16
 #define empty.cursor_height 16
 static unsigned char empty.cursor_bits[] = {
 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00};

add
 xsetroot -cursor empty.cursor empty.cursor

to your ~/.xinitrc

=Official Debian Port=

An official Debian port based on the FSO image is being created. First information can be found at http://wiki.debian.org/DebianOnFreeRunner. Early adopters are welcome.
