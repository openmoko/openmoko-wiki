Litephone is a phone application using FSO. The basic idea behind the Litephone GUI is that it is packed in one window, the various 'modules' (contacts, messages, dialer, etc) placed into tabs. No popup windows.

You can run it in 3 modes:

litephone demo - runs it with bogus data (contacts, etc), and generates bogus call and message events. You can test most of the gui this way.

litephone nogsm - runs it with bogus data, but no events

litephone - normal mode
