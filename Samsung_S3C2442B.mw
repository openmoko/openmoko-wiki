The Samsung S3C2442B is the CPU of the [[Neo1973 GTA02 Hardware|Neo FreeRunner GTA02]]. It is based on an ARM920T core.

The datasheet for this is at [http://www.opatnet.cz/elektronika/datasheet/U/um_s3c2442b_rev12.pdf this link].

One difference is that the CPU voltage limits are specified variably from 400MHz (1.5V) to 50MHz (1V) the current at these speeds is not mentioned. The FreeRunner includes a variant that can be clocked up to 500MHz, however a) current consumption is insane at this frequency and b) various other components can't cope with the peripheral clock at this speed. It is therefore safe to assume that the highest frequency for the [[Neo FreeRunner]] is 400MHz.

 [...]
 apart from two differences, [the S3C2442B] is software/register-wise exactly
 identical to the s3c2440.  Hardware-wise it is packaged with 64MByte
 (x32) SDRAM and depending on the type, 128/256MByte NAND flash (2k page
 size).
 
 The differences are:
 
 1) all pull-up resistors (GPBUP, ...) are now pull-down
 2) the default initializers for the PLL have changed

The data sheet for the S3C2440A seems to be available at [http://www.tranzistoare.ro/datasheets/restul/259649_DS.pdf]. Samsung's page with more superficial information on the S3C2440 is at [http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/productInfo.do?fmly_id=229&partnum=S3C2440&&ppmi=PartnoSearch].
