The data sheet for this processor does not currently seem to be available online, but [[User:HaraldWelte|Harald Welte]] wrote in [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/neo1973-hardware/2007-September/000235.html| an e-mail] to the neo1973-hardware mailing list:

 [...]
 apart from two differences, [the S3C2442B] is software/register-wise exactly
 identical to the s3c2440.  Hardware-wise it is packaged with 64MByte
 (x32) SDRAM and depending on the type, 128/256MByte NAND flash (2k page
 size).
 
 The differences are:
 
 1) all pull-up resistors (GPBUP, ...) are now pull-down
 2) the default initializers for the PLL have changed

The data sheet for the S3C2440A seems to be available at [http://www.tranzistoare.ro/datasheets/restul/259649_DS.pdf].
