= ScummVM = 

ScummVM is a program which allows you to run certain classic graphical point-and-click adventure games, provided you already have their data files. The clever part about this: ScummVM just replaces the executables shipped with the game, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed!

You can obtain it either by using [[Mokomakefile]] via

 # make build-package-scummvm

or using a binary, like so:

 # wget http://rabenfrost.net/celtune/ipk/armv4t/libmpeg2-0_0.4.0b-r4_armv4t.ipk
 # wget http://rabenfrost.net/celtune/ipk/armv4t/libvorbis_1.0.1-r2_armv4t.ipk
 # wget http://rabenfrost.net/celtune/ipk/armv4t/scummvm_0.9.1-r4_armv4t.ipk
 # opkg install libmpeg2-0_0.4.0b-r4_armv4t.ipk libvorbis_1.0.1-r2_armv4t.ipk scummvm_0.9.1-r4_armv4t.ipk

The games are copyrighted so you'll only be able to play those you own. You can also download some free games from [http://www.scummvm.org/downloads.php#extras scummvm.org] and from the [http://www.the-underdogs.info Home of the Underdogs].

When starting ScummVM use the command

 # openmoko-scummvm

This will map '''AUX''' button to the '''F5''' key, which is used to access the ScummVM menu. You should also find an entry on the main menu under ''Games''.

'''Note:''' The AUX button does not work. There is no way to exit the game besides doing a killall scummvm.

'''Note:''' It would be great if it where possible to get audio through the headphones and speaker muted.

More information on ScummVM can be found on the [http://www.scummvm.org/ official] site

=== Monkey Island 2 ===
