= ScummVM = 

ScummVM is a program which allows you to run certain classic graphical point-and-click adventure games, provided you already have their data files. The clever part about this: ScummVM just replaces the executables shipped with the game, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed!

JadeFalcon (irc nick) has provided a fixed bitbake recipe for users of OM2007.1. You can download the [http://buildhost.automated.it/scummvm/  recipe] and [http://buildhost.automated.it/scummvm/ pre-built ipk] files for use on your Neo 1973.

The games are copyrighted so you'll only be able to play those you own.
