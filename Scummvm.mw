= ScummVM =

ScummVM is a program which allows you to run certain classic graphical point-and-click adventure games, provided you already have their data files. The clever part about this: ScummVM just replaces the executables shipped with the game, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed!

You can obtain it either by using [[Mokomakefile]] via

# make build-package-scummvm

or using a binary, like so:

 opkg install http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/feeds/2007/ipk/glibc/armv4t/base/libmad0_0.15.1b-r0_armv4t.ipk \
 http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/feeds/2007/ipk/glibc/armv4t/base/libmpeg2-0_0.4.0b-r4_armv4t.ipk \
 http://downloads.tuxfamily.org/3v1deb/openmoko/scummvm_0.12.0_armv4t.ipk

The games are copyrighted and the copyright holder has not given you a license to redistribute them so you'll only be able to play those you own. You can also download some free games from [http://www.scummvm.org/downloads.php#extras scummvm.org] and from the [http://www.the-underdogs.info Home of the Underdogs].

When starting ScummVM use the command

# openmoko-scummvm

This will map '''AUX''' button to the '''F5''' key, which is used to access the ScummVM menu. You should also find an entry on the main menu under ''Games''.

'''Note:''' On the Neo Freerunner the wrong keycode (not '''AUX''') is mapped to '''F5'''. Here is a corrected version of the file ''/usr/bin/openmoko-scummvm'' (it is ''/usr/bin/scummvm'' for me on OM2008.12):

<pre>#!/bin/sh

# Save current AUX Key mapping
SAVE_KEY="$(xmodmap -pke | grep 'keycode 177')"

# Map AUX Key to F5
xmodmap -e "keycode 177 = F5"

# Turn LCD feft
xrandr -o left

# Start the scummvm in fullscreen mode
scummvm --fullscreen --themepath=/usr/share/scummvm/

# Turn LCD normal
xrandr -o normal

# Restore the AUX Key mapping
xmodmap -e "$SAVE_KEY"</pre>

'''Note:''' It would be great if it where possible to get audio through the headphones and speaker muted.

=== Problems with mouse cursor ===

If the mouse cursor is shifted from where you click, just move your finer on touchscreen until you catch the cursor in corner. Now it will work correctly.

=== Monkey Island 2 ===

To be able to play Monkey Island 2 you need to pass ScummVM a parameter:<br>
root@fic-gta01:/$ DISPLAY=:0 openmoko-scummvm --boot-param=10001 monkey2

For easy access from the menu you can create a menu entry by creating the file /usr/share/applications/monkeyisland2.desktop with the following content:

<pre>[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=LeChuck's Revenge
Comment=Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge
Exec=openmoko-scummvm --boot-param=10001 monkey2
Icon=monkeyisland2.png
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=Games;
StartupNotify=false</pre>

'''No Desktop Icon Method'''

Making a change to your scummvmrc does not clutter up your desktop with another icon and keeps the interface consistent.  Add the following to your scummvmrc (default location of ~/.scummvmrc) at the top global section add:

copy_protection=0

And after adding the Monkey Island 2 via the Scummvm GUI add the following below the [monkey2] section:

boot_param=10001

Then you can launch Monkey Island 2 from the menu like any other game without the annoying copy protection screens.
