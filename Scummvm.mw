= ScummVM = 

ScummVM is a program which allows you to run certain classic graphical point-and-click adventure games, provided you already have their data files. The clever part about this: ScummVM just replaces the executables shipped with the game, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed!

'''Note:''' Scummvm runs in landscape mode and due to the bug http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1244 it is not yet usable.

'''JadeFalcon''' (IRC nick) has provided a fixed bitbake recipe for users of OM2007.1. You can download the [http://buildhost.automated.it/scummvm/scummvm.tar.bz2  recipe] and [http://buildhost.automated.it/scummvm/ pre-built ipk] files for use on your Neo 1973.

The games are copyrighted so you'll only be able to play those you own. You can also download some [http://www.scummvm.org/downloads.php#extras free games].

When starting ScummVM use the command

 # openmoko-scummvm

This will map '''AUX''' button to the '''F5''' key, which is used to access the ScummVM menu. You should also find an entry on the main menu under ''Games''.

More information on ScummVM can be found on the [http://www.scummvm.org/ official] site
