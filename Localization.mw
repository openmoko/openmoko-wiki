This page is for openmoko localization.

= Adding UTF-8 input support to e =
'''NOTICE''': thanks to great work by Ainulindale, it's already there in shr-unstable, so none of the following steps are needed. Read [[Localization#Localize_SHR|Localize SHR]] for a quick introduction.

E input doesn't work without proper locale, therefore you must install and use a utf8 locale.
I made a package that creates en_US.utf8 locale and sets it on boot time.
if you have any bug fixes/suggestions please let me know. (TAsn)

Package: [http://www.stosb.com/openmoko/shr-utf8_0.1_armv4t.ipk Locale]

What it generally does:
# installs all dependencies
# installs locale-gen script (took from arch linux and removed a deprecated section)
# generates locales
# adds the locale to the system by adding a script to profile.d/locale.sh


Known issues:
The correct keyboard layout should be loaded before use.
Either by a hack like in: [http://lucky.awardspace.co.uk/openmoko xmodmap]
or by proper layout loading.

According to raster (and verified by me), the e version used by openmoko is old and this was resolved in later versions. Should update the distro's build version.

= Localize SHR =
On SHR you install the desired locales, rename the folder $HOME/.e and restart X to choose you're locale when asked for it. You can change the locale any time via illume wrench language settings.
<pre>
opkg install locale-base-XX-YY   # (e.g. locale-base-de-de, locale-base-es-es, ...) 
mv ~/.e ~/.e.bak                 # move e's config cache
/etc/init.d/xserver-nodm restart # restart X and choose your locale
</pre>
