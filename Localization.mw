This page is for openmoko localization.

= Adding UTF-8 input support to e =
E input doesn't work without proper locale, therefore you must install and use a utf8 locale.
I made a package that creates en_US.utf8 locale and sets it on boot time.
if you have any bug fixes/suggestions please let me know. (TAsn)

Package: [http://www.stosb.com/openmoko/shr-utf8_0.1_armv4t.ipk Locale]
