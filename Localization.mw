This page is for openmoko localization.

= Adding UTF-8 input support to e =
E input doesn't work without proper locale, therefore you must install and use a utf8 locale.
I made a package that creates en_US.utf8 locale and sets it on boot time.
if you have any bug fixes/suggestions please let me know. (TAsn)

Package: [http://www.stosb.com/openmoko/shr-utf8_0.1_armv4t.ipk Locale]

What it generally does:
# installs all dependencies
# installs locale-gen script (took from arch linux and removed a deprecated section)
# generates locales
# adds the locale to the system by adding a script to profile.d/locale.sh


Known issues:
The correct keyboard layout should be loaded before use.
Either by a hack like in: [http://lucky.awardspace.co.uk/openmoko xmodmap]
or by proper layout loading.

for some reason xserver doesn't allocate enough key spaces for the illume keyboard, which makes the keyboard dance between keycodes, which for some reason makes the e applications go crazy. Should check and verify.
