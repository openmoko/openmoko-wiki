Work in progress. [[Talk:SHR_User_Manual|Comments here]]


==SHR Introduction==

'''SHR''' (Stable Hybrid Release) is a community driven distribution based on the [[FSO]] framework. SHR can use several different graphical toolkits, for example GTK or EFL. At first, SHR was introduced in order to use the [[Om 2007.2]] GTK software in combination with the new FSO, but things have changed, software got developed further and development is still progressing.

''TODO: Text from [[SHR]], enhance.''

==SHR Specific==

At this point, there are some applications and procedures that are purely specific to SHR and would not run on another distribution. For example the phone applications (Dialer, Messages and Contacts) and SHR Settings depend heavily on the ophonekitd daemon.

In sense of the underlying phone subsystem SHR is based on [[FSO]] so basically any application using FSO has a chance to run, should all required libraries be available. In the future, this will give a chance to some other GUI phone managers to be chosen from.

==Installation==

===Getting SHR===
===GSM firmware===

If you don't have Moko11 as your GSM firmware yet, you should update it: See [[GSM/Flashing]]

''TODO: Include the full GSM upgrade procedure? Or perhaps as an addendum?''


===Boot loader===


Recent bootloaders ensure proper kernel loading. [[qi]] is recommended but [[Bootloader|uboot]] is still fun optional and supported. The latest boot loader files are available at http://downloads.openmoko.org/distro/testing/

===Installation on Flash===

===Installation on µSD Card===


===SHR version===

To find out what version of SHR you have installed, please run

 cat /etc/shr-version


or check SHR Settings -> Other -> Image information



==Running SHR==
===Booting===
Press the power button shortly once to start the Freerunner. Booting splash screen will appear. First boot after new installation takes always a bit longer. Sometimes, it is recommended to reboot after this first boot, to make sure all packages got initialized properly.

[[Image:Shr-boot-preview.png|200px|thumb|center|SHR Boot Splash screen]]

===Initial Setup===

[[Image:SHR-Setup-Language.png|200px|thumb|Initial setup]]
On the first boot, Setup is automatically initiated to walk the user through basic setup of the Enlightenment desktop environment. You are able to choose preferred language of the desktop environment, Illume SHR themed profile or select default menu (only one at the moment). On the Add icon screen you can add icons for some application. If you add a terminal based application like mplayer, you will see an icon but no application running upon click, as it will run in the background. Last screen allow settin up quick launch applications. TODO: what does quick launch do anyways?

===SIM Auth===

[[Image:SHR-SIM-Auth.png|200px|thumb|SIM Auth]]
SIM Pin is asked for upon start up.

===First look===
[[Image:SHR-First-Look.png|200px|thumb|Desktop screen]]
'''Illume desktop''' is default home screen of the SHR desktop. Application files located in /usr/share/applications are displayed here. All applications are ran fullscreen and you can switch between them by using the Task switcher in the Top Shelve or by using the < left or right > arrows in the Top Shelve.

The Illume desktop can be easily customized - slide the Top Shelve down and tap the Settings icon (Wrench).

{{Note|TIP: for better access of the Settings icon, tap and hold the Settings icon, then drag it to the right.}}

'''Illume settings''' provides various options to alter the desktop environment. You can change sizes of elements, single or double click, wallpaper. To access all the various options, open Illume Settings and slide the visible icons to the left, to preview more options on the right hand side.

The little applets in the Top Shelve (for example Battery, GSM, Bluetooth etc.)  are called '''Shelve gadgets''' and you can configure whether they are visible (on the front part of the top shelve) or hidden (you can access them by sliding the top shelve) through Illume Settings -> Display -> Shelve gadget.

Some screens are not resized properly to fit the Freerunner's display - for example the Wallpapper setting. This is a known bug already reported upstream.

<!-- [[Image:SHR-Top-Shelve.png|200px|thumb|Top Shelve]] -->

===Phone applications===

Besides other software, SHR comes with 4 main phone applications: Dialer, Contacts, Messages and Phone log.

===First steps===

Right after installation and first boot you might want to do a few initial steps:

'''Establish network connection''' and SSH into your Freerunner. The root account uses no password by default. You can establish connection either via USB to your desktop and enable NAT or you can connect through Wifi. If you use USB, some setup is required on the desktop side, please read [[USB_Networking]]. For Wifi, you can use [[#Network manager|Network Manager]]

'''Check if GSM is working correctly''' - observe the GSM gadget in the Top Shelve and see reported signal of your GSM operator 

'''Check and set call volume''' - this is handled by alsa state files in /usr/share/shr/scenarii/ . To customize speaker volume edit /usr/share/shr/scenarii/gsmheadset.state and change control 4. Values between from 105 to 120 might be sufficient.

Shell you want to alter more parameters be aware that each file is a set of value for the 94 parameters. Some of the important ones are:

 Control 48: internal mic of the tel (set to 2 or 3)
 Control 4 : internal speaker (set from 110 to 120)
 Control 49: headset mic
 Control 3 : headset speaker 
 Control 4 : internal speaker (set from 110 to 120)

'''Initialize opkg database''' in order to install some applications from SHR repositories or from other sources, for example [[http://opkg.org opkg.org]]. While still being online, you need to first run

 opkg update

===Under the hood===

SHR is based on linux kernel and Openembedded. XGlamo is providing X server environment and Illume (Enlightment window manager module for small devices) is providing comfortable finger controlled desktop environment. Under the hood of the pretty desktop there is FSO middleware talking to the GSM modem, GPS module as well as to the other bits of hardware. SHR ophonekitd daemon is run with X server start up and it that communicates with FSO via d-bus. SHR phone applications talk to ophonekitd and also to FSO so for example when you receive a phone call, the dialer is launched to provide a way of answering it. Dialer, Contacts and Messages applications are part of the SHR internal libframeworkd-phonegui-efl library, Phone log is an extra application written in python-gtk.

===Localization===
[[Image:SHR-Illume-Settings-Languages.png|200px|thumb|Setting Language]]

You can change the language of the SHR desktop environment by using the Settings of Illume. For Example, for Czech language: in Illume Top Shelve go to Wrench (Settings) -> Language -> Language Settings -> and choose: Čeština. If your language is not in the menu you can install by using opkg.

You can list all available languages by running:

 opkg list | grep glibc-locale-

And install the language of your choice (for example czech):

 opkg install glibc-locale-cs

After this, the Language Settings of Illume will offer Czech. 


This will localize the Illume environment and will also set correct lang environment variable. If you wish to have translations for other applications, you need to install them again (presuming they are available):

This will install czech localisation for SHR phone applications, SHR Settings and TangoGps:

 opkg install libframeworkd-phonegui-efl-locale-cs shr-settings-locale-cs tangogps-locale-cs

For localized terminal environment (ssh login) set lang variables set /etc/profile, example for Czech language:

 export LANG=cs_CZ
 export LC_ALL=cs_CZ


The Illume keyboard offers english dictionary correction by default. You can list all the dictionaries available for installation:

 opkg list | grep illume-dic


If your language is not available and english is bothering you, you can set an empty dictionary:

 echo "" > /usr/lib/enlightenment/modules/illume/dicts/None.dic

By using it, it will get filled by the words you use and after time will start helping and correcting your typing.

===Date and time===

Timezone is automatically retrieved from the GSM network. Date and time are automatically set from GPS or Network. The easiest way of setting the time for the first time is to run TangoGps (GPS & Map icon) and obtaining GPS fix. Time will then be set automatically after several minutes.

Time can set time also manually.

Via SHR-Settings -> Date/time -> Set time

From linux based desktop:

 ssh root@192.168.0.202 "date -u -s `date -u +%m%d%H%M%Y.%S`"

You can also set the hardware clock to the system time:

 hwclock --systohc

==SHR Settings==

SHR Settings


SHR Settings is the main setting application of SHR. In the background it uses [[FSO]] specific dbus calls as well as low level commands. The graphical interface is Elementary-Python based. It provides an easy way of setting up your phone to your liking - from phone related settings, to requesting resources in order to prevent screen dim or suspend (for example while using GPS).

While some settings are persistent over reboots, other are not.

''TODO: list persistent/non persistent settings, or make a note at each section''



SCREEN

===Main Screen===
Main screen is divided into few categories, which contain modules. Every SHR Settings module has specified task - control GSM antenna power, set actual time etc. 

===Phone===

==System Customizing==

'''Changing the splash screen'''

list available splash screen themes

 opkg list | grep splash-theme

and install one of the available themes

 opkg install shr-splash-theme-dontpanic

Then go to SHR Settings -> Others -> Themes. Here you can preview installed themes and change the default one.


'''Enable mouse cursor''' 

edit line 121 of /etc/X11/Xinit and erase -hide-cursor

 ARGS="$ARGS -dpi ${DPI} -screen ${SCREEN_SIZE} -mouse tslib -root-ppm /usr/share/pixmaps/xsplash-vga.ppm vt1"
            

'''Connect Bluetooth keyboard'''

Turn Bluetooth on in SHR Settings -> Connectivity, then in terminal run

 hidd --search


If you try to change Wallpaper or Theme and Illume keeps on crashing, it might be caused by the whole Illume running in Software_16 mode. Go to Illume Settings, slide the icon bar and select Advanced. There tap on Engine and select Software. After this, you can change your Wallpaper or Theme. Selecting Software_16 later on again will speed up the desktop's response (though causing it to be a bit uglier).
