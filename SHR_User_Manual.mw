This is the future home for SHR User Manual.


==SHR Introduction==

'''SHR''' (Stable Hybrid Release) is a community driven distribution based on the [[FSO]] framework. SHR can use several different graphical toolkits, for example GTK or EFL. At first, SHR was introduced in order to use the [[Om 2007.2]] GTK software in combination with the new FSO, but things have changed, software got developed further and development is still progressing.

''TODO: Text from [[SHR]], enhance.''

==SHR Specific==

At this point, there are some applications and procedures that are purely specific to SHR and would not run on another distribution. For example the phone applications (Dialer, Messages and Contacts) and SHR Settings depend heavily on the ophonekitd daemon.

In sense of the underlying phone subsystem SHR is based on [[FSO]] so basically any application using FSO has a chance to run, should all required libraries be available. In the future, this will give a chance to some other GUI phone managers to be chosen from.

==Installation==

===Getting SHR===
===GSM firmware===

If you don't have Moko11 as your GSM firmware yet, you should update it: See [[GSM/Flashing]]

''TODO: Include the full GSM upgrade procedure? Or perhaps as an addendum?''


===Boot loader===


Recent bootloaders ensure proper kernel loading. [[qi]] is recommended but [[Bootloader|uboot]] is still fun optional and supported. The latest boot loader files are available at http://downloads.openmoko.org/distro/testing/

===Installation on Flash===

===Installation on ÂµSD Card===


===SHR version===

To find out what version of SHR you have installed, please run

 cat /etc/shr-version


or check SHR Settings -> Other -> Image information

===Instalator===

==Running SHR==
===Booting===
(Qi) Press the power button shortly once to start the Freerunner. Booting splash screen will appear.

===Initial Setup===

On the first boot, Setup is automatically initiated to walk the user through basic setup of the Enlightment desktop environment.

Choose your preffered language
[[Image:SHR-Setup-Language.png]]

Choose Illume SHR themed profile
[[Image:SHR-Setup-Profile.png]]

Choose default menu (only one at the moment)
[[Image:SHR-Setup-Menu.png]]

Here you can add icons for some application. If you add a terminal based application like mplayer, you will see an icon but no aplication running upon click, as it will run in the background.

===SHR Settings===

SHR Settings


SHR Settings is the main setting application of SHR. In the background it uses [[FSO]] specific dbus calls as well as low level commands. The graphical interface is Elementary-Python based. It provides an easy way of setting up your phone to your liking - from phone related settings, to requesting resources in order to prevent screen dim or suspend (for example while using GPS).

While some settings are persistent over reboots, other are not.

''TODO: list persistent/non persistent settings, or make a note at each section''

While there are several ways of networking - Wifi, USB, Bluetooth and Gprs - By default, USB networking is enabled in /etc/network/interfaces.

Enhanced configuration is possible through direct editing of /etc/network/interfaces or through Mokonnect.

Connmand daemon with Mokonnect are the recommended user level applications for setting up networking. At the moment, Mokonnect can manage USB, Wifi and Gprs connections. Wifi device is not required to be manually turned on via SHR-Settings as Mokonnect will automatically enable the device when needed and disable after use.
