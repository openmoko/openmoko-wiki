TouchKo's (now Wacom Company Ltd.) spatial capacitive "touchscreen", can sense fingers at a small distance, so you do not get your display greasy, and can unlike some touchscreens, be operated with gloves.

I do not know how good or bad it works. (--[[User:Glenn|Glenn]] 07:23, 5 August 2007 (CEST))

Thought educational example:
*If the Neo1973 detect a finger have pressed the screen, the Neo1973 should vibrate two short times and reply one of these:
**"You can touch my screen, but I also understand close proximity finger sign language.".
**"Do not touch my screen, I understand close proximity finger sign language.".
