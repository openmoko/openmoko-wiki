Q: How long has there been duplicates on the Openmoko mailing lists?

A: Since the list got so big that sita.openmoko.org can't handle it. See [http://admin-trac.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1372 ticket #1372].

Q: How long has that been?

A: At least a year, maybe more.

Q: Has Openmoko done anything about it?

A: Doesn't seem so.  Must be a hard problem.

Q: Is Openmoko likely to fix it?

A: If they haven't fixed it by now, then chances are they probably won't.

Q: What should I do about it?

A: Don't email the list about - we all know already.

Q: How can I fix it locally for me?

A: Get a mail reader that understands that a message with a duplicate Message-Id header field doesn't need to be displayed to the user.
