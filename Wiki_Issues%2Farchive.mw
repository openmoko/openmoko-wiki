===Accepted proposals===

==== Problems with certain SIM-cards ====
I think most information concerning problems with some SIM-cards can be deleted. This problem has been fixed a long time ago with the new GSM firmware (see [[GSM/Flashing]]). Therefore I'm proposing to remove most of the page [[FreeRunner unable to work with 3G SIM cards]] (just leaving an explanation of the problem there, and redirect pepole who might have bought a FreeRunner with an older firmware to [[GSM/Flashing]]), delete [[Carriers]], [[Carriers/Rogers]] and the section of "Status of AT&T SIM Cards" in [[Carriers/ATT]]. --[[User:Marko Knöbl|Marko Knöbl]] 16:17, 8 February 2010 (UTC)

==== Wiki Maintenance Agenda ====
I'm proposing deleting the page [[Wiki Maintenance Agenda]]. It is duplicating the efforts of [[Openmoko Wiki Editing Guidelines]] --[[User:Marko Knöbl|Marko Knöbl]]

==== Roadmap/Telephony ====
I'm proposing [[Roadmap/Telephony]] for deletion. It's showing the outdated roadmap from 2007-12 which was never updated. --[[User:Marko Knöbl|Marko Knöbl]]
