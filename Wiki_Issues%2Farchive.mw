===Accepted proposals===

==== Problems with certain SIM-cards ====
I think most information concerning problems with some SIM-cards can be deleted. This problem has been fixed a long time ago with the new GSM firmware (see [[GSM/Flashing]]). Therefore I'm proposing to remove most of the page [[FreeRunner unable to work with 3G SIM cards]] (just leaving an explanation of the problem there, and redirect pepole who might have bought a FreeRunner with an older firmware to [[GSM/Flashing]]), delete [[Carriers]], [[Carriers/Rogers]] and the section of "Status of AT&T SIM Cards" in [[Carriers/ATT]]. --[[User:Marko Knöbl|Marko Knöbl]] 16:17, 8 February 2010 (UTC)

==== Wiki Maintenance Agenda ====
I'm proposing deleting the page [[Wiki Maintenance Agenda]]. It is duplicating the efforts of [[Openmoko Wiki Editing Guidelines]] --[[User:Marko Knöbl|Marko Knöbl]]

==== Roadmap/Telephony ====
I'm proposing [[Roadmap/Telephony]] for deletion. It's showing the outdated roadmap from 2007-12 which was never updated. --[[User:Marko Knöbl|Marko Knöbl]]

==== missing bad block table support ====
The earliest software for the Neo 1973 did not support bad block tables. As this issue is not present anymore I think the associated pages can be deleted: [[Migration to bad block tolerant builds]], [[Building Openmoko from scratch (pre-BBT)]] --[[User:Marko Knöbl|Marko Knöbl]] 19:12, 11 February 2010 (UTC)

==== [[Application UI Design Recommendations]] ====
This comes from the time when there was only one official Openmoko distribution. These recommendations are not relevant anymore. --[[User:Marko Knöbl|Marko Knöbl]] 19:23, 11 February 2010 (UTC)

==== [[Om 2009 get active]] ====
Outdated, Om 2009 is not developed anymore --[[User:Marko Knöbl|Marko Knöbl]] 19:53, 11 February 2010 (UTC)

==== [[Summer of Code 2007]] ====
Old ideas, some parts already implemented. Content not modified since ~2007 (only minor fixes) --[[User:Leadman|LeadMan]] 

==== [[Summer of Code 2008]] ====
Old ideas, some parts already implemented. Content not modified since ~2008 (only minor fixes) --[[User:Leadman|LeadMan]] 

==== [[Openmoko 2008 Summer Intern Program/zh tw]] ====
No English version, looks like connected with [[Summer of Code 2008]]-so maybe not needed anymore, might be wise to contact with authors before deletion, content not modified since ~2008 (only minor fixes) --[[User:Leadman|LeadMan]]

==== [[Personas]] ==== 
Outdated, this was intended to help the Openmoko team develop the right products. --[[User:Leadman|LeadMan]]

==== [[Hardware:Neo1973:Alternate Cases:Ruggedized]] ==== 
Only raw idea, outdated, not updated for long time --[[User:Leadman|LeadMan]] 

==== outdated translations ====
Many translated pages are very old. Even though the [[Translation HOWTO]] suggests that "It's better to have some translation than nothing" I think those translations in which the [[Neo 1973]] is presented as the only Openmoko phone should be deleted. Therefore I propose the deletion of these pages: [[Main Page/bg]], [[Main Page/ee]], [[introduction/ee]], [[FAQ/ee]], [[Main Page/gr]], [[Main Page/kr]], [[Main Page/ro]], [[Main Page/sk]] --[[User:Marko Knöbl|Marko Knöbl]] 16:02, 13 February 2010 (UTC)

==== [[Problems with Vodafone Italia SIM]] ====
This page was used by an editor to ask a question. The right place for this is the mailing list.--[[User:Marko Knöbl|Marko Knöbl]] 21:51, 16 February 2010 (UTC)

==== Group sales pages ====
Most of the group sales pages are unused now (see [[:Category:Group Sales]]) and haven't changed for a long time. I propose deleting all pages from that category except the [[Group sales]] page which is still receiving some attention. However I think we can remove all entries which are older than one year from that page as well.--[[User:Marko Knöbl|Marko Knöbl]] 20:04, 22 February 2010 (UTC)

===Rejected proposals===

==== [[SMSTool]] ====
* This is a very old, unfinished program. --[[User:Marko Knöbl|Marko Knöbl]] 19:44, 11 February 2010 (UTC)

* We should take care for [http://mput.de/~kristian/.openmoko/SMSTool-0.3c.tar.bz2 source code] of [[SMSTool]] before deleting this page. I know it is python, but it would be waste to loose the code. --[[User:Leadman|LeadMan]]

:Thank you for pointing this out. I just updated the page to make it clear that this program is not developed anymore, and I think we can keep the page in this state now so the download link won't be lost --[[User:Marko Knöbl|Marko Knöbl]] 15:12, 13 February 2010 (UTC)
