= Background =
There is a GTA04 Group Tour (http://www.handheld-linux.com/wiki.php?page=GTA04%20Group%20Tour) to get enough units to reduce the price from currently 666 EUR to 479/499 EUR.
Unfortunately this is still too high for some members of the community, while others are willing to donate some money to make the group tour a success, but don't need two or more units.

= Idea =
To bring both parties together, please add yourself to this list if you are seeking a subsidy from a helpful donator. Ir if you search someone to do substantial work and want to subsidize it.

= How to use this list =
Since you should also give something to the community, please formulate a project what you would like to work out.
Donators should scan this list and directly contact the project owner. If you agree, arrange for a single order in the online shop.
