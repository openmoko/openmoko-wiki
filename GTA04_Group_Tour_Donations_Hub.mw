There is a GTA04 Group Tour (http://www.handheld-linux.com/wiki.php?page=GTA04%20Group%20Tour) to get enough units to reduce the price. Unfortunately it is still too high for some members of the community while others are willing to donate some money to make the group tour a success. To bring both parties together, please add yourself to this list if you are seeking a subsidy from a helpful donator. Since you should also give something to the community, please formulate a project what you would like to work out.
Donators should scan this list and directly contact the project owner. If you agree, arrange for a single order in the online shop.
