=Introduction=
Illume is a module for [http://www.enlightenment.org  Enlightenment] that modifies the user interface of enlightenment to work cleanly and nicely on a mobile device - such as an Openmoko phone. It is currently geared more for a 480x640 (VGA) portrait mode screen but can be trivially modified to work on QVGA or any other resolution. The Final goal is to have it work on a wide range of resolutions seamlessly.

It combines an application launcher interface along with an application manager and switcher, virtual keyboard support, as well as forcing certain simple layout policies on applications (such as making their main windows borderless and fullscreen except for Illume's control bar), as well as support for the X11 port of qtopia.

=Getting Started=

Here is how to get started and install illume on your desktop and try it out. This would also allow development on it, adding features you need and testing them. For this you will want code. First you will want Enlightenment's latest and greatest. How much do you want? You can get the whole repository, or just the bits you need. If you want the whole thing in one checkout, please see http://svn.enlightenment.org for information. If you want to just get a quick script that does it for you try http://www.rasterman.com/files/get_e.sh - this script will check out only the bits of SVN you need. It also assumes you have sudo root access and if on Ubuntu or debian it will try and install packages known to be needed for building, or useful. read the script if you are not sure. if it doesn't know what distribution you use, you will need to try and have a working compiler, autotools etc. etc. yourself. Once you have run this and built and installed everything you will need illume, so fetch it with:

svn checkout <nowiki>http://svn.enlightenment.org/svn/e/trunk/illume</nowiki>

Now you just need to build it like everything else. (it is assumed you know about CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, PATH etc. in installing software and compiling it). Illume compiles like everything else in E land - standard autotools, so (in illume's source directory):

./autogen.sh
make
sudo make install

This will compile and install illume. As illume is a module, not a program in its own right, you need to run it with enlightenment, so use the provided run-script:

./x-ui.sh

and if you have xephyr installed and everything went ok, a 480x640 window will pop up - with enlightenment in it on your DISPLAY=:1 x display with all your system's app icons there.

=== How to install the illume (Raster's) keyboard ? ===

Short answer: opkg install illume-config-illume

Detailed answer:
 1. opkg install illume-config (Get the qwerty button if not there yet)
 2. add "export QTOPIA_NO_VIRTUAL_KEYBOARD=1" in /etc/X11/Xsession.d/89qtopia (Turn off built-in qtopia keyboard)
 3. opkg install illume-config-illume
 5. rm -rf ~/.e/e/config/illume (Purge E's cache)
 6. /etc/init.d/xserver-nodm restart (Restart X)

Then switch keyboard from "None" to "Default" in Illume's preferences.

=== How to use (Raster's) keyboard ? ===

 - Sliding down over any keyboard sends Enter
 - Sliding up over any keyboard switches to the next keyboard
 - Tapping the upper-right key ("a", "1" or "q") lists the available keyboards
 - Tapping the upper-left key "Abc" lists the available dictionaries
 
 - With "a" keyboard:
    - Sliding left over the keyboard deletes the last entered key
    - Sliding right over the keyboard sends the composed word
    - Tapping the upper-left key "Abc" during the composition of a word
      lists all possible words in order to choose the right one
 
 - With "q" keyboard:
    - Sliding left over the keyboard sends a backspace
    - Sliding right over the keyboard sends a space
