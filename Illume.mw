il·lume (ĭ-lōōm') tr.v. To illuminate. 
Bringing light to the darkness of the mobile world.

=Introduction=
Illume is a module for Enlightenment (www.enlightenment.org) that modifies the user interface of enlightenment to work cleanly and nicely on a mobile device - such as an OpenMoko phone. It is currently geared more for a 480x640 (VGA) portrait mode screen but can be trivially modified to work on QVGA or any other resolution. The Final goal is to have it work on a wide range of resolutions seamlessly.

It combines an application launcher interface along with an application manager and switcher, as well as forcing certain simple layout policies on applications (such as making their main windows borderless and fullscreen except for Illume's control bar).

This is a work in progress and may change drastically. Please watch this space for more information on how to set it up and make it work for you. Right now The code is in SVN, but with no helping hand.

=Getting Started=
So how do you get started? Well first you will want to check out the code from SVN:

	svn checkout svn://svn.projects.openmoko.org/svnroot/illume
	
Then you will want to read the README file that comes with Illume. This will be kept up to date as needed to help you be able to build, install and use it. Eventually there will be just a nice IPK file to install that will do it all for you, but for now, this will do.

Here are screenshots so you know what Illume looks like (at the moment). It is not complete visually or functionally, but it can do the following:

Display all applications definied in the system menu
Launch and track applications
Switch applications
Close applications
Add/configure gadgets in Enlightenment and use them
Do most things E could do
Eat small children
