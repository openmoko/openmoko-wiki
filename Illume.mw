=Introduction=
[http://illume.projects.openmoko.org/ Illume] is a module for [http://www.enlightenment.org  Enlightenment] that modifies the user interface of enlightenment to work cleanly and nicely on a mobile device - such as an Openmoko phone. It is currently geared more for a 480x640 (VGA) portrait mode screen but can be trivially modified to work on QVGA or any other resolution. The Final goal is to have it work on a wide range of resolutions seamlessly.

It combines an application launcher interface along with an application manager and switcher, virtual keyboard support, as well as forcing certain simple layout policies on applications (such as making their main windows borderless and fullscreen except for Illume's control bar), as well as support for the X11 port of qtopia.

=Getting Started=

Here is how to get started and install Illume on your desktop and try it out. This would also allow development on it, adding features you need and testing them. For this you will want code. First you will want Enlightenment's latest and greatest. How much do you want? You can get the whole repository, or just the bits you need. If you want the whole thing in one checkout, please see http://svn.enlightenment.org for information. If you want to just get a quick script that does it for you try http://www.rasterman.com/files/get_e.sh - this script will check out only the bits of SVN you need. It also assumes you have sudo root access and if on [http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu] or [[Debian]] it will try and install packages known to be needed for building, or useful. Read the script if you are not sure. If it doesn't know what distribution you use, you will need to try and have a working compiler, autotools etc. etc. yourself. Once you have run this and built and installed everything you will need illume, so fetch it with:

<pre>
svn checkout http://svn.enlightenment.org/svn/e/trunk/e/src/modules/illume/
</pre>

Now you just need to build it like everything else. (it is assumed you know about CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, PATH etc. in installing software and compiling it). Illume compiles like everything else in E land - standard autotools, so (in Illume's source directory):

<pre>
./autogen.sh
make
sudo make install
</pre>

This will compile and install Illume. As Illume is a module, not a program in its own right, you need to run it with Enlightenment, so use the provided run-script:

<pre>
./x-ui.sh
</pre>

and if you have [[Getting Openmoko working on host with Xephyr|Xephyr]] installed and everything went ok, a 480x640 window will pop up - with Enlightenment in it on your DISPLAY=:1 X display with all your system's app icons there.

=== How to install the illume (Raster's) keyboard ? ===

Make sure you have installed illume-config (qwerty button) and illume-config-illume
<pre>
opkg install illume-config illume-config-illume 
</pre>

Turn off built-in qtopia keyboard:

Edit /etc/X11/Xsession.d/89qtopia and set
<pre>
export QTOPIA_NO_VIRTUAL_KEYBOARD=1
</pre>
Add it if it is not there.

Purge E's cache
<pre>
rm -rf ~/.e/e/config/illume
</pre>

Restart X
<pre>
/etc/init.d/xserver-nodm restart
</pre>

Then switch keyboard from "None" to "Default" in Illume's preferences.

*Troubleshoting
If this does not work for your installation: See [[Keyboard Toggle]] or change /etc/enlightenment/default_profile to point to the illume profile instead of asu.

=== How to use [[Illume_keyboard|(Raster's) keyboard]]? ===

* Sliding down over any keyboard sends Enter
* Sliding up over any keyboard switches to the next keyboard
* Tapping the upper-right key ("a", "1" or "q") lists the available keyboards
* Tapping the upper-left key "Abc" lists the available dictionaries
<br>
* With "a" keyboard:
* Sliding left over the keyboard deletes the last entered key
* Sliding right over the keyboard sends the composed word
* Tapping the upper-left key "Abc" during the composition of a word
lists all possible words in order to choose the right one
<br>
* With "q" keyboard:
* Sliding left over the keyboard sends a backspace
* Sliding right over the keyboard sends a space

Icons are created by hand in a 25x25 PNG with the GIMP according to color picker values of flags in Wikipedia. The reason for this is, that no rescaling or ant-alias artifacts will emerge in this small raster. Subsequently, import this in Inkscape and type the characters. Note that for keyboard layout that are not connected to a single particular country, like Persian, no flag backgrouns is needed. Each character is typed twice in Arial Black or bold Arial. For alphanumeric, use the ABC of that language, for 'QWERTY' use the 6 first characters on the top row, note that for languages that read from richt to left is to use 'first'/last 6 characters on the right side. One characters is white with a black border of 0.5 and one is black without border but with a blur of 15 (see CTRL+SHIFT+F slider at the bottom). Reposition the whole lot and put everything in the correct layer. Export a 25x25 PNG with the background bitmap, which is also the selected export area, and you are done. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6QNL1mvXdI Here] is a video of this procedure.

'''TODO''': Rasterman, can you verify this and improve this procedure where needed? Especially improve details on which font to use and which Gaussian blur to use.

==== How to install a new Keyboard Layout ====

* copy or download the kbd File to <pre>/usr/lib/enlightenment/modules/illume/keyboards</pre>
* issue the command: 'killall -HUP enlightenment'
* if that didn't work do: now restart the XServer with the following command <pre>/etc/init.d/xserver-nodm restart</pre>
* you should now be able to select the newly installed keyboard

==== How to make your own Keyboard Layout (Illustration)====
