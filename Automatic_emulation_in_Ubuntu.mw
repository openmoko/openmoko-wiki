This is a tutorial for getting an emulation environment on a Ubuntu system. For other systems see [[installation manual]]

== Tutorial / Manual ==

You have to known that there is a great tool to get it running on a linux system,namely the [[MokoMakefile]]. This is a sort of wrapper round several instructions, so it is easy to set up and maintain a development environment. If you build the whole [[MokoMakefile]], you will need approximately 12GB, a swap+ram memory of about 1GB and minimum 5 hours time. But we will only build it for Qemu (the emulator that I will use) and that needs (on my system) only 890mb and a 15 min of your time. Enought blabla.

To get it running, you will have to tweak your ubuntu a little bit (This will not damage other programs, everything will work as before). For more information see http://www.openembedded.org/wiki/OEandYourDistro

    sudo dpkg-reconfigure dash

and select NO if it ask to install dash as /bin/sh.
Install the needed stuff:

    sudo apt-get install monotone git-core cogito python-dev ccache m4 sed bison make cvs gawk libc6-dev g++ subversion sharutils docbook openjade quilt libmpfr-dev libpcre3-dev texinfo texi2html libboost-date-time-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-regex-dev libboost-test-dev libboost-dev zlib1g-dev build-essential dh-make debhelper devscripts gcc-3.4 lynx netpbm libsdl1.2-dev dosfstools

Voila your system is ready to get the install the openmoko.
First we will create a directory and download the MokoMakefile in it:

    mkdir openmoko
    cd openmoko
    wget http://www.rwhitby.net/files/openmoko/Makefile

Now we will tell to build it for using it with Qemu:

    make qemu

This will download the necessarily files of the lastest release and build them following the MokoMakefile. After that it will start into the emulator for the first time. Voila your have now successfully installed openmoko onto your ubuntu system. If you want to start it, you will have to go into the folder and run the following command:

    cd openmoko
    make run-qemu


If you run openmoko, the bootloader will load, there you can choose different options. For select an option you have to press enter (=aux) and to execute it, hit space (=power). Thus if the bootloader shows, you just have to hit the space bar and the phone software will load.
