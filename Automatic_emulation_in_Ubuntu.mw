This is a tutorial for getting an emulation environment on an Ubuntu system. For other systems see the [[Installation_guide]]

== Installation ==

You have to known that there is a great tool to get it running on a linux system,namely the [[MokoMakefile]]. This is a sort of wrapper round several instructions, so it is easy to set up and maintain a development environment. If you build the whole [[MokoMakefile]], you will need approximately 12GB, a swap+ram memory of about 1GB and minimum 5 hours time. But we will only build it for Qemu (the emulator that I will use) and that needs (on my system) only 890mb and a 15 min of your time. Enought blabla.

To get it running, you will have to tweak your ubuntu a little bit (This will not damage other programs, everything will work as before).
* Open your terminal (Applications->Accessories->Terminal).
* Enter following command and select NO if it ask to install dash as /bin/sh.
    sudo dpkg-reconfigure dash
* Install the needed programs (You will have to enter your password):
    sudo apt-get install monotone git-core cogito python-dev ccache m4 sed bison make cvs gawk libc6-dev g++ subversion sharutils docbook openjade quilt libmpfr-dev libpcre3-dev texinfo texi2html libboost-date-time-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-regex-dev libboost-test-dev libboost-dev zlib1g-dev build-essential dh-make debhelper devscripts gcc-3.4 lynx netpbm libsdl1.2-dev dosfstools
Voila your system is ready to get the install the openmoko.

Now we will install Openmoko in a directory by downloading the MokeMakefile in it and build it.
* Create a directory and go into the directory:
    mkdir openmoko
    cd openmoko
* Get the MokoMakefile:
    wget http://www.rwhitby.net/files/openmoko/Makefile
* Make the MokoMakefile and tell it, you want to install it for qemu:
    make qemu

This will download the necessarily files of the lastest release and build them following the MokoMakefile. After that it will start into the emulator for the first time. Voila your have now successfully installed openmoko onto your ubuntu system.

== Start Openmoko==
* Open your terminal (Applications->Accessories->Terminal).
* Go to the directory:
    cd openmoko
* starting with the MokoMakefile
    make run-qemu
Now the bootloader will load. There you can choose different options. For select an option you have to press enter (=aux) and to execute it, hit space (=power). Thus if the bootloader shows, you just have to hit the space bar and the phone software will load.

== Update Openmoko==
* Open your terminal (Applications->Accessories->Terminal).
* Go to the directory:
    cd openmoko
* Update with the MokoMakefile
    make qemu
