!User||Amount of liquid || Type of liquid || Damage?
|-
|bradpitcher||total immersion||water||No apparent damage.  I immediately opened the case and removed the battery, tried to shake off excess water, and let sit to dry for a day before restarting it.  NOTE: this does not mean the Neo is waterproof.  Do NOT try this at home!

!User||Symptom || Circumstances || Damage?
|-
|freelock||AUX button broke||One day it just quit clicking, no tactile feedback||Took apart the front of the Neo, and the little contact had popped off the circuit board. Now I need to find a soldering iron and remember how to do this kind of thing!
