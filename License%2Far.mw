For all '''native''' applications, we use the GNU General Public License (GPL).
This means that we commit ourselves to the 'standard' copyleft license which
covers by far the most Free Software programs today.

Any extension or contribution that somebody makes (and wants to distribute) has 
therefore to be released under the exact same license.

The future license compatibility is guaranteed by using the FSF-default
"or any later version" statement.

The '''exact''' following header shall be present in all source code and header files
of applications that were entirely and originally developed by the OpenMoko project:

=== Libraries: LGPL ===

For all '''native''' libraries, we use the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).

Any extension or contribution that somebody makes (and wants to distribute) has 
therefore to be released under the exact same license. 

However, while we ourselves are committed to Free Software, we do not want to constrict
the use of those libraries by developers of applications who want to create a non-free
program.

The future license compatibility is guaranteed by using the FSF-default
"or any later version" statement.

If we extend/enhance or contribute back to existing Free Software programs,
we have to (and will) comply with existing licenses.  This means that all
our code will be
