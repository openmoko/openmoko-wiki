==NOR on GTA02==

GTA02 has 2 MB of NOR flash for emergency boot or other usage.

==Write NOR (GTA02)==

You have to use a debug board and [http://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/src/host/norwp/ norwp utility] to pull high the write enable line. Alternatively, you can just connect an external 1.8-3.3V supply to the relevant testpoint (H-TP4711, see schematics and pcb layout); a hackish approach would be to temporarily connect H-TP4711 to H-TP4714 (console rxd) and then issue "s3c24xx-gpio h7=1" command to ensure needed voltage (this is not supported, though experimentally tested approach). You could use flashing script from the following address: [http://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/src/host/devirginator/flashnor].

GTA02 A5 DVT1 units (in prototypes page, comes without write protection nor, you could re-flash it anytime)
