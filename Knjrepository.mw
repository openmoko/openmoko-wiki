== Packages for development ==

The knjRepository includes the following interesting packages:

# '''php526''' - PHP 5.2.6 CLI support, which enables you to write CLI-scripts for your OpenMoko. It also includes PDO (SQLite3) support.
# '''php526-gtk2''' - PHP-GTK enables you to write GTK-applications in PHP.
# '''ruby1.8''' - Enables you to use Ruby scripts on your OpenMoko.
# '''libgtk2-ruby1.8''' - Enables Ruby to use Gtk.
# '''libsqlite3-ruby1.8''' - Enables you to use SQLite3-databases in Ruby.
# '''libglade2-ruby1.8''' - Enables you to use Glade with Gtk-applications in Ruby.


(and a lot of other Ruby-extensions like SOAP and WSDL)

A list of all the packages can be found [http://downloads.kaspernj.org/openmoko/repository/ here].



== Application packages ==
# '''knjMokoWifi''' - An application for configuring the wireless interface in the OpenMoko-phone. It works with WPA, WEP and no-encryption. It supports profiles, so you dont have to remember passwords for each wireless accesspoint you come across. It is written in PHP-GTK. Furthermore it can disable the routing-gateway on the USB-networking-interface, making the default gateway wifi. It can also start a DHCP-request getting an IP and so on for the wireless interface.



== How to use ==

You can configure your phone to use the repository by doing the following:

wget http://downloads.kaspernj.org/openmoko/repository/knjrepository.conf -O /etc/opkg/knjrepository.conf

opkg update

(ignore the signature errors)


Then if you want to install PHP-GTK, you can do this:

opkg install php526 php526-gtk2


Or if you want Ruby with Gtk-support:

opkg install ruby1.8 libgtk2-ruby1.8 libglade2-ruby1.8 libsqlite3-ruby
