**Works well with SHR-Testing and usb port set to "host". Only issue i have with mine is that the up arrow seems to not work on any device. This may be an issue specific only to my keyboard. I recommend testing yours at the shop first.


=== Arrow keys disfunction ===
All external keyboards have similar problem with arrows mapping. This short script helps you to solve it:  

 #!/bin/sh
 xmodmap -e "keycode 198 = Up NoSymbol Up"
 xmodmap -e "keycode 204 = Down NoSymbol Down"
 xmodmap -e "keycode 200 = Left NoSymbol Left"
 xmodmap -e "keycode 201 = Right NoSymbol Right"
