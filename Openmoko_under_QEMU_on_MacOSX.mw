I try to put here my notes on setting up OpenMoko environment (Qemu and MokoMakefile) on Mac OS X.

= Introduction =

Some time ago I ask if anyone has ever set up OpenMoko environment on MacOS X. No one has answered that he did but several people were interested. So I deceided to wrote some directions on how to do that. 

As for now I was not successful but I am still trying ;)

= Setting up environment =

== Prequisites ==

Install fink and darwinports (both have neccesary packages).

Follow instructions on:
http://www.openembedded.org/wiki/BuildOnOSX
to set up OE environment.

It is neccessary to create new disk image, just as BuildOnOSX says. 

If you're compiilng something connected with X11 be sure to install X11devel package from your MacOS X CD1.

You can get mentioned packages using darwinports:

<pre>
sudo port install quilt
sudo port install py-psyco
sudo port install cogito
</pre>

Then get  Q[kju] project: http://www.kju-app.org/proj/wiki/CompilingQ into /Volumes/OE/Q but do not compile it yet (run only "prepare the sources"). This will be needed for compiling Neo1973 emulator.

Set up environment as described in MokoMakefile:

<pre>
cd /Volumes/OE
mkdir moko; cd moko
wget http://www.rwhitby.net/files/openmoko/Makefile

make setup
</pre>

= Making developers image =

<pre>
make openmoko-devel-image
</pre>

I had problems with bitbake - it does not run correctly with psyco (I got "Illegal instruction error" and make exited with error 132)  so I had to disable it: I run bitbake  -d openmoko-devel-image in MokoMakefile.

= Patching qemu-neo1973 =

The main idea is to get patches for gcc-4.x from Q project and apply it to qemu-neo1973 branch. I'm still working on it.

= Building emulator =
