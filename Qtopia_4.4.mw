== Bugs in 4.4.1 ==
* Timezone & time on latest Qt 4.4.1
* The first item in a list is missing the top half (workaround: just slide the list down to make it show)

==== Bluetooth ====
If bluetooth was turned off before flashing with the qtopia image, bluetooth will not work, the bluetooth menu will show "(Bluetooth not available.)". The system script "Power on bluetooth" doesn't seem to work (please confirm). 

'''Solution''': Open a terminal or ssh onto the device and run:
    # /etc/init.d/bluetooth start
Now, use the bluetooth menu and do your thing.
