This page is intended to summarize in one place the various images you can try out on your Openmoko Neo FreeRunner (GTA02) or 1973 (GTA01).  Note however, that some of these are works in progress and may not have even released any files yet.  Nothing is guaranteed to work.  Proceed at your own risk.

Currently, the images in development include:
*The 2007.2 GTK Image that ships on the Freerunner
*The ASU (April|August Software Update) qtopia-based Image
*The FSO (FreeSmartPhone.org) Image
*Qtopia image from qtopia.net
*The SHR (Stable Hybrid Release) Image
*Copying a jffs2 image to ext2 to boot from microSD

;See [[Distributions]] for a chart comparing the features of the various images.

Michael Lauer's blog also has an entry comparing the distributions: [http://www.vanille-media.de/site/index.php/2008/06/28/gtk-asu-fso-tmtla/ GTK, ASU, FSO? TMTLA!]

Instructions on flashing your FreeRunner or 1973 are provided at [[Flashing the Neo FreeRunner]] and [[Getting Started with your Neo1973]], respectively.

Users may have heard of "ScaredyCat" images. These are usable images created by [http://blog.automated.it/category/openmoko/ Andy Powell] and are currently based on the 2007.02 software stack.

 Hey, all file names are with "gta01" !
 Is this an error and they are gta02 (FR) ??

==SHR (Stable Hybrid Release) Image==
The Stable Hybrid Release (SHR) is intended to be a combination of the
FSO, some of the 2007.2 GTK software, and the ASU that provides all of
the functionality of the 2007.2 software, but with the stability of
the FSO and the new GUI toolkits provided by the ASU. It will probably
be based on an ASU build, with the FSO software and GTK end-user apps
added.

The SHR doesn't exist anywhere but in a few people's heads at the moment (2008-07-05).  Hopefully, all the work in it will be integrated back into one of the other releases, and it will cease to exist.  The point is to get us a release with stable calls & suspend/resume, plus access to all those other nifty apps we had on 2007.2 and the ASU.
