====='''Period 2010-01-01 to 2010-01-14'''=====

==Introduction==
Since begin of year 2010 a lot has happened, both in application and distribution ground. But not everyone remembers, that all this progress would not be possible without '''middleware''' software layer. Following this thought we would like to remind FreeRunner's community about, often underestimated, [http://www.ohloh.net/p/fso FSO] framework. Michael 'Mickey' Lauer, FSO's Framework lead [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2010-January/058826.html stated], that 2009 was a turbulent year for FSO's team and thanked to all contributors and users of FSO APIs.

Concerning general problem of "invisibility", which affects all middleware, together with Sebastian Spaeth [http://lists.shr-project.org/pipermail/shr-devel/2010-January/001785.html post], which states that currently only one guy ('Mickey') is working, unpaid, on FSO development, we would like to call Community for help. '''Both, developers men-power and financial contributions are needed''' to keep up great progress of FSO Framework. Keep in mind, that this progress will affet all distributions and applications which use FSO Framework. Thus, if you have few spare coins on your PayPal account, and willing to donate to [?link? FSO project], or particular FSO [http://www.ohloh.net/p/fso/contributors contributors], go for it!

Most important and change making mails on the mailing lists, blogs etc.. Coolest hacks, screenshots, themes etc..

* '''Harald Welte''' is [http://laforge.gnumonks.org/weblog/2010/01/07/#20100107-gsm_devel_board-planning planning] to create a GSM development board based on 100% open hardware design and 100% free software. The initial focus is to create a board that behaves like a GSM cellphone. This could be interesting for the gta02-core project.

* Werner Almesberger posted another '''[http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/gta02-core/2010-January/000808.html component update]''' note. It states that there are plenty of mechanical parts left but electrical parts are more of a problem. There seem to be some inconsistencies in the inventory, so some positions may still change. If you are able to provide project with with missing parts, take a look at '''[http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/gta02-core/2010-January/000815.html full inventory list]''' and consult with Werner.

* Marc Andre Tanner made some boot time optimization with his '''[http://repo.or.cz/w/qi-bootmenu-system.git qi-bootmenu-system]''' and provided his latest [http://www.brain-dump.org/tmp/uImage-GTA02-bootmenu.bin kernel] build and slightly modified version of [http://www.brain-dump.org/tmp/qi-s3c2442-bootmenu.udfu Qi], although it isn't strictly necessary. You can read more about [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.handhelds.openmoko.devel/4434 qi-bootmenu] or about [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/openmoko-kernel/2009-December/010778.html boot time optimization]

* '''[[SHR]]''' is a community driven distribution and according to latest [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2010-January/058833.html pool], is the most popular OS for the Freerunner. Although it has not made a stable release yet, it is actively developed. According to this [http://lists.shr-project.org/pipermail/shr-devel/2010-January/001800.html thread], recently a substantial FSO upgrade (mentioned in Introduction) is hitting SHR. Thanks to reimplementation of FSO middleware API's in Vala, you can expect significant speed improvements. Specifically, SHR-Unstable now features fsodeviced, fsousaged and fsonetworkd, and introduces a more elegant separation of configuration files for each daemon. Images are now available for [[UBIFS]], in addition to jffs and ext. The discussions about faster kernels is also affecting SHR among other distributions. MTD_NAND_VERIFY_WRITE kernel option, which should speed it up, is already pushed in. Experimental kernels (2.6.29-rc3-drm, 2.6.31, 2.6.32) are [http://build.shr-project.org/tests/mrmoku/kms/images/om-gta02/ available] for testing.

* Gennady Kupava has been [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/openmoko-kernel/2010-January/010811.html working] on optimizing the speed of kernel and [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/openmoko-kernel/2010-January/010804.html measuring the result]. This has caused a [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/openmoko-kernel/2010-January/010844.html great noise] on the kernel list and irc. It seems that even after that many months of work on the kernel, one can still discover new ways of catching big chunks of speed improvements here and there. Some interesting [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/openmoko-kernel/2010-January/010853.html results here].
