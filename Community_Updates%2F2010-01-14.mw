==Community==

Most important and change making mails on the mailing lists, blogs etc.. Coolest hacks, screenshots, themes etc..

* '''Harald Welte''' is [http://laforge.gnumonks.org/weblog/2010/01/07/#20100107-gsm_devel_board-planning planning] to create a GSM development board based on 100% open hardware design and 100% free software. The initial focus is to create a board that behaves like a GSM cellphone. This could be interesting for the gta02-core project.

* '''SHR update:''' 

[[SHR]] is a community driven GNU/Linux distribution for smartphones and
is the most popular Operating System for the Freerunner. It has not
made a stable release yet, but enjoys continuous development, and this
is an update on all the great work that has been done recently.
Unstable and testing images are available for both the Freerunner, and
Neo 1973. 
A list of notable updates:

A substantial FSO upgrade is hitting SHR. The reimplementation of FSO
API's in Vala is progressing, and is providing significant improvements
in speed. Specifically, SHR-U now features fsodeviced, fsousaged and
fsonetworkd. The upgrade also introduces a more elegant system of
separate configuration files for each daemon in etc/freesmartphone/*. 

Images are now available for ubifs, in addition to jffs and ext. ubifs
promises improved performance, as well as smarter logic of uSD wear.

The discussion about faster kernels is also affecting SHR;
(MTD_NAND_VERIFY_WRITE) is already pushed in. Experimental kernels
(2.6.29-rc3-drm, 2.6.31, 2.6.32) are available for testing at:
