The initial focus is to create a board that behaves like a GSM cellphone. This could be interesting for the gta02-core project.

* Werner Almesberger posted another '''[http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/gta02-core/2010-January/000808.html component update]''' note. It states that there are plenty of mechanical parts left but electrical parts are more of a problem. There seem to be some inconsistencies in the inventory, so some positions may still change. If you are able to rpovide project with with missing parts, take a look at '''[http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/gta02-core/2010-January/000815.html full inventory list]''' and consult with Werner.

A list of [http://lists.shr-project.org/pipermail/shr-devel/2010-January/001800.html notable updates]:

A substantial FSO upgrade is hitting SHR. The reimplementation of FSO
API's in Vala is progressing, and is providing significant improvements
in speed. Specifically, SHR-U now features fsodeviced, fsousaged and
fsonetworkd. The upgrade also introduces a more elegant system of
separate configuration files for each daemon in etc/freesmartphone/*. 

Images are now available for ubifs, in addition to jffs and ext. [[Ubifs]]
[http://www.mail-archive.com/shr-user@lists.shr-project.org/msg02603.html promises] improved performance, as well as smarter logic of uSD wear.

The discussion about faster kernels is also affecting SHR;
(MTD_NAND_VERIFY_WRITE) is already pushed in. Experimental kernels
(2.6.29-rc3-drm, 2.6.31, 2.6.32) are available for testing at:
