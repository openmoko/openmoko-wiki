==Distributions==

{{DistributionBox|
Name=[[SHR]]|
Description=SHR is a community driven GNU/Linux distribution for smartphones.

It has not made a release yet and this is an update on all the great work that has been done recently. Unstable and testing images are available for Freerunner and also for Neo 1973.

A list of updates:

* quite big FSO upgrade is hitting SHR. Parts of the FSO are bit by bit being rewritten to Vala and this shows great speed improvement. The new upgrade also introduces better system of separate configs file for each daemon in  etc/freesmartphone/* instead of huge frameworkd.conf . (In shr-u it's fsodeviced, fsousaged and fsonetworkd now).

* images are generated in jffs and ext, newly ubifs images are being provided. ubifs should be having better performance in speed, it also has smarter logic of uSD wear. 

* discussion about faster kernels is also affecting SHR, (MTD_NAND_VERIFY_WRITE) is already pushed in. There are some experimental kernels (2.6.29-rc3-drm, 2.6.31, 2.6.32) available for testing.
