== Overview ==
Although [[OpenMoko]] is designed for smartphones that use a stylus, it would be foolish to expect people to only operate their handsets with stylus. For this reason, some core phone-related applications will be developed with finger (as opposed to stylus navigation) in mind.

{{note| Applications listed on this page are listing in order of priority and by phase. 1st phase is for January. 2nd phase is more long term...when we are ready for mass market appeal.}}


== General Principles ==
* All modifications are saved instantenously, there should never be a save command
* Make sure users can't make interface operation errors, or that the effects are easily reversible, instead of just notifying them us the potential consequences of their actions.
* When you open a document you should be returned to the place where you were working when you last closed or save it (this is our concepts of sessions).
* Label buttons with adjectives, which describe the state of the object affected
* Designers should seek an efficient monotonous solution to gain benefits, including ease of learning, simplicity of implementation, minimization of documentation, and lowered maintenance costs.
* Whenever you find yourself specifying an error message, please stop; then redesign the interface so that the condition that generated the error message doesn't arise.
* Is the user gets no utility from a process, there is no reason to tell them that it is happening.

{{note|Innovation usually happens at the bottom. What we need to do is provide consistent ways to develop and deploy appliations.}}
