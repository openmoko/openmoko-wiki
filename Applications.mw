This page lists some of the software that you can install on your Openmoko smartphone and describes other sources to find more software.

The purpose of this page is not to be exhaustive, but simply to provide an easy shelter where everybody can add links for Openmoko-related programs. Applications, scripts, projects, distributions, images at all maturity levels are welcome. Please limit each entry to one line. You may create a new wiki page or just provide an outgoing link. 

Some of these software are developed by Openmoko Inc. and some are contributed by the community. Any problems with community contributed software should be reported to the individual software developer rather than the Openmoko core team.

== Application lists ==

Please click the "List of ..." links below for more detailed information, like screenshots or availability on various distributions. 

'''Please note that not all of these applications are in a finished format yet.''' When they are complete you will be able to download them via a menu on the phone.    At the moment, following a recipe of commands in the console window may be needed to install.   This will of course improve with time :-) 

'''Please also note that there is some risk in installing developing software or software from an unknown source!'''  However, if the license for the code is an open source license then you have the comfort that anyone in the Openmoko community has the ability to check the operation of the software and thus malicious or vulnerable code is likely to be detected quickly.

Please assign new and existing application pages to this list, the related List of.. page and the related applications category to help readers finding it.

== Where to find more applications? ==

Not all Openmoko apps are listed on this wiki - there are much more [http://projects.openmoko.org/softwaremap/ projects at the Openmoko GForge] than the wiki can list, not to mention self-hosted applications on their own websites. Actually the phones can run most Linux based Free Software, using for example the [[Debian]] distribution. The [http://handhelds.freshmeat.net/browse/1038/ mobile phones section of Freshmeat] may be a interesting place to look.
