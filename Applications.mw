== An automatic list of application-related wiki pages ==

The pages linked above are all maintained manually. We also maintain an automatic categorization system by tagging wiki pages. Here is the list of application-related pages in this wiki. Normally, every page listed below should be also listed above in the same category. The converse is false: there are applications without a wiki page.

<div style="border: solid 1px black; padding: 1ex"><b>Applications in this Wiki:</b>
<categorytree mode=pages depth=2 hideroot=on>Applications</categorytree>
</div>


== Where to find more applications? ==

At [http://opkg.org opkg.org] !

Not all Openmoko apps are listed on this wiki - there are much more [http://projects.openmoko.org/softwaremap/ projects at the Openmoko GForge] than the wiki can list, not to mention self-hosted applications on their own websites. Actually the phones can run most Linux based Free Software, using for example the [[Debian]] distribution. The [http://handhelds.freshmeat.net/browse/1038/ mobile phones section of Freshmeat] may be a interesting place to look.

== Where to find full distributions ? ==

* [[Download]]: for complete system downloads

== The usual warnings ==
<small>
* Some of these software are developed by Openmoko Inc. and some are contributed by the community. Any problems with community contributed software should be reported to the individual software developer rather than the Openmoko core team.
* Most programs listed here are not mature/stable, but only useable/beta.
* Many programs listed here are not yet packaged for your distribution and integrated in its repositories. Whichever it is.
* Installing experimental software from the internet is certain to break things. Running it as root is a very insecure thing to do. Kown that you will be burned, have backups, and be ready to apologize to everybody in your phone contact list in case they receive strange SMSs...
