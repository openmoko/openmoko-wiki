== Overview ==
Although [[OpenMoko]] is designed for smartphones that use a stylus, it would be foolish to expect people to only operate their handsets with stylus. For this reason, some core phone-related applications will be developed with finger (as opposed to stylus navigation) in mind.

== General Principles ==
* All modifications are saved instantenously, there should never be a save command
* Make sure users can't make interface operation errors, or that the effects are easily reversible, instead of just notifying them us the potential consequences of their actions.
* When you open a document you should be returned to the place where you were working when you last closed or save it (this is our concepts of sessions).
* Label buttons with adjectives, which describe the state of the object affected
* Designers should seek an efficient monotonous solution to gain benefits, including ease of learning, simplicity of implementation, minimization of documentation, and lowered maintenance costs.
* Whenever you find yourself specifying an error message, please stop; then redesign the interface so that the condition that generated the error message doesn't arise.
* Is the user gets no utility from a process, there is no reason to tell them that it is happening.

Panel Applications are individual executables residing in the [[Top Panel]]. They're usually indicating a status and offer a pop-up menu. We are not yet sure whether there is enough screen real estate for this huge number of panel applications.
