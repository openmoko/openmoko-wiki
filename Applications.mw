== Overview ==
Although [[OpenMoko]] is designed for smartphones that use a stylus, it would be foolish to expect people to only operate their handsets with stylus. For this reason, some core phone-related applications will be developed with finger (as opposed to stylus navigation) in mind.

{{note| Applications listed on this page are listing in order of priority. Applications in '''bold''' are required for mass production and the first shippment of handsets.}}


== General Principles ==
* All modifications are saved instantenously, there should never be a save command
* Make sure users can't make interface operation errors, or that the effects are easily reversible, instead of just notifying them us the potential consequences of their actions.
* When you open a document you should be returned to the place where you were working when you last closed or save it (this is our concepts of sessions).
* Label buttons with adjectives, which describe the state of the object affected
* Designers should seek an efficient monotonous solution to gain benefits, including ease of learning, simplicity of implementation, minimization of documentation, and lowered maintenance costs.
* Whenever you find yourself specifying an error message, please stop; then redesign the interface so that the condition that generated the error message doesn't arise.
* Is the user gets no utility from a process, there is no reason to tell them that it is happening.

{{note|Innovation usually happens at the bottom. What we need to do is provide consistent ways to develop and deploy appliations.}}
