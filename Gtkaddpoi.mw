==Introduction==
gtkaddpoi is a simple gtk interface for search an address and add as POI on TangoGPS. Then you can export POI to a .kml file or into Navit bookmark.
You can insert cordinate and description for geocaghing.
It's use Yahoo Maps API for found coordinate from an address and put this POI on TangoGPS database.
You can also delete a POI from TangoGPS database or export to KML ( http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-December/038449.html )

and then:

 opkg install gtkaddpoi_0.6_all.opk

or directly:
