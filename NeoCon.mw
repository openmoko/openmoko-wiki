'''neocon''' is a handy serial console utility (not only) for [[Bootloader|u-boot]].

'''neocon''' has a few graving advantages over some other terminal apps:

* You don't have to be <code>root</code> to access <code>/dev/ttyACM0</code> with '''neocon'''. Beeing member of <code>dialout</code> should give you sufficient privileges. 
* by specifying a delay  on keyboard input(as shown below), '''neocon''' will allow you to paste commands directly from clipboard without making [[Bootloader|u-boot]] choke on it. 
* '''neocon''' can be started without <code>/dev/ttyACM0</code> being available. It will automatically connect as soon as you start [[Bootloader|u-boot]] on the Neo:

The main feature of neocon is actually that you can give it a list
of devices and it will pick one that works, e.g.,

 # neocon /dev/ttyUSB{0,1,2}

If you don't like the one it picked, you can switch to the next with
 ~n

This is useful for dynamically allocated devices, such as ttyUSBn
or ttyACMn. You can of course also use them with other communication
programs - there's certainly no shortage of them - but then you have
to handle reconnects manually.

==Installation==
Download the source from http://svn.openmoko.org/developers/werner/neocon/ to a directory of your choice and build '''neocon''' by issuing 

 make

==Usage==
To connect to the [[bootloader]] use

 ./neocon -t 30 /dev/ttyACM0

To quit neocon type:

 ~.
