'''neocon''' is a handy terminal application (not only) for [[Bootloader|u-boot]].

'''neocon''' has a few graving advantages over some other terminal apps:

* You don't have to be <code>root</code> to access <code>/dev/ttyACM0</code> with '''neocon'''. Beeing member of <code>dialout</code> should give you sufficient privileges. 
* '''neocon''' can be started without <code>/dev/ttyACM0</code> being available. It will automatically connect as soon as you start [[Bootloader|u-boot]] on the Neo. 
* by specifying a delay  on keyboard input(as shown below), '''neocon''' will allow you to paste commands directly from clipboard without making [[Bootloader|u-boot]] choke on it. 

Download the source from http://svn.openmoko.org/developers/werner/neocon/ to a directory of your choice and build '''neocon''' by issuing 

 make

To connect to the [[bootloader]] use

 ./neocon -t 30 /dev/ttyACM0


To get rid of neocon, just issue a

 killall neocon
