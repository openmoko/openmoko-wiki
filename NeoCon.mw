'''neocon''' is a handy terminal application (not only) for [[Bootloader|u-boot]].

'''neocon''' has a few graving advantages over some other terminal apps:

* You don't have to be ''root'' to access /dev/ttyACM0 with '''neocon'''. Beeing member of ''dialout'' should give you sufficient privileges. 
* '''neocon''' can be started without /dev/ttyACM0 beeing available. It will automatically connect as soon as you start [[Bootloader|u-boot]] on the Neo. 
* due to the delay it puts on keyboard input, neocon will allow you to paste commands directly from clipboard without making [[Bootloader|u-boot]] choke on it. 

Download the source from http://svn.openmoko.org/developers/werner/neocon/ to a directory of your choice and build '''neocon''' by issuing 

 make

To connect to the [[bootloader|Bootloader]] use

 ./neocon -t 30 /dev/ttyACM0


To getrid of neocon, just issue a

 killall neocon
