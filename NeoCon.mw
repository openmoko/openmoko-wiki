'''neocon''' is a handy terminal application (not only) for [[u-boot|Bootloader]].

'''neocon''' has a few graving advantages over some other terminal apps:

* You don't have to be root to access /dev/ttyACM0 with '''neocon'''. Beeing member of ''dialout'' should give you sufficient privileges. 
* '''neocon''' can be started without /dev/ttyACM0 beeing available. It will automatically connect as soon as you start u-boot on the Neo. 
* due to the delay it puts on keyboard input, neocon will allow you to paste commands directly from clipboard without making u-boot choke on it. 

You can download the source at http://svn.openmoko.org/developers/werner/neocon/. Build ''neocon'' by issuing 

 make

To connect to the [bootloader|Bootloader] use

 ./neocon -t 30 /dev/ttyACM0


To getrid of neocon, just issue a

 killall neocon
