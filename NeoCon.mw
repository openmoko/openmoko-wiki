neocon is a handy terminal application for using with u-boot.

You can download the source at http://svn.openmoko.org/developers/werner/neocon/.

 wget http://svn.openmoko.org/developers/werner/neocon/README
 wget http://svn.openmoko.org/developers/werner/neocon/Makefile
 wget http://svn.openmoko.org/developers/werner/neocon/neocon
 make

To connect to the [bootloader|Bootloader] use
 ./neocon -t 30 /dev/ttyACM0


For use with u-boot neocon has a few graving advantages over some other terminal apps:

* You don't have to be root to access /dev/ttyACM0 with '''neocon'''. Beeing member of ''dialout'' should give you sufficient privileges. 
* neocon an be started without /dev/ttyACM0 beeing available. It will automatically connect as soon as you start u-boot on the Neo. 
* due to the delay it can put on keyboard input, neocon will allow you to paste commands directly from clipboard without making u-boot choke on it. 

To getrid of neocon, just issue a
 killall neocon
