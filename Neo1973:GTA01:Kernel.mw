This is a rough cut at documenting stuff as I find it.

/sys/class/backlight/gta01-bl is a directory containing:
actual_brightness reports on current set brightness. (0-5096)
uevent ?
brightness set brightness echo 1000 >brightness dims somewhat
max_brightness Maximum possible brightness
subsystem


/sys/class/leds/gta01:vibrator/brightness - echo 1>brightness turns vibrator on
