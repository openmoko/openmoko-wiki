This is a rough cut at documenting stuff as I find it.

/sys/class/backlight/gta01-bl is a directory containing:
{| cellspacing="0" border="1"
!filename
!description
|-
|actual_brightness 
|reports on current set brightness. (0-5194)
|-
|max_brightness 
|Maximum possible brightness
|-
|subsystem
|
|-
|uevent 
|?
|-
|brightness 
| dim with something like:<pre>echo 1000 > /sys/class/backlight/gta01-bl/brightness </pre>
|-
|power
| Turn backlight off with: <pre>echo 1 >/sys/class/backlight/gta01-bl/power</pre> and turn on with: <pre>echo 0 >/sys/class/backlight/gta01-bl/power</pre>
|-

|}

----

/sys/class/leds/gta01:vibrator/brightness -  
* turn vibrator on:
 echo 1 >/sys/class/leds/gta01:vibrator/brightness
* turn vibrator off:
 echo 0 >/sys/class/leds/gta01:vibrator/brightness
