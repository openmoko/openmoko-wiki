This is a rough cut at documenting stuff as I find it.

/sys/class/backlight/gta01-bl is a directory containing:
{| cellspacing="0" border="1"
!filename
!description
|-
|actual_brightness 
|reports on current set brightness. (0-5096)
|-
|max_brightness 
|Maximum possible brightness
|-
|subsystem
|
|-
|uevent 
|?
|-
|brightness 
| dim with something like:<pre>set brightness echo 1000 >brightness </pre>
|-

|}

/sys/class/leds/gta01:vibrator/brightness -  
* turn vibrator on:
 echo 1>/sys/class/leds/gta01:vibrator/brightness
* turn vibrator of:
 echo 1>/sys/class/leds/gta01:vibrator/brightness
