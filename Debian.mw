== Installation ==
There are official instructions on how to install Debian on http://wiki.debian.org/DebianOnFreeRunner, and the [http://lists.linuxtogo.org/pipermail/smartphones-standards/2008-August/000232.html announcement].

Previous, partly now outdated information on how to install Debian manually has been moved to [[Manual Debian]].
== Suspend ==
To make suspend available you have to install apmd:
 apt-get install apmd
After that you can suspend your phone with:
 apm -s
and make it wake up again with pressing the power button.

[[User:Wuth|Wuth]] 06:28, 17 August 2008 (UTC): I found that apmd was already installed by using the official debian installation procedure, but that the kernel didn't support apm.  I haven't yet resolved this issue.

== Time ==

The default time zone is UTC.  Reconfigure it by running

 # tzconfig

I've set the clock manual using, e.g.

 # date -s 00:33

but I believe I'll probably have to set up ntp at some point.
