== Installation ==
There are official instructions on how to install Debian on http://wiki.debian.org/DebianOnFreeRunner, and the [http://lists.linuxtogo.org/pipermail/smartphones-standards/2008-August/000232.html announcement].

Previous, partly now outdated information on how to install Debian manually has been moved to [[Manual Debian]].
== Suspend ==
To make suspend available you have to install apmd:
 apt-get install apmd
After that you can suspend your phone with:
 apm -s
and make it wake up again with pressing the power button.
