== Installation ==
There are official instructions on how to install Debian on http://wiki.debian.org/DebianOnFreeRunner, and the [http://lists.linuxtogo.org/pipermail/smartphones-standards/2008-August/000232.html announcement].

Previous, partly now outdated information on how to install Debian manually has been moved to [[Manual Debian]].
== ssh ==

As with the standard Openmoko distribution, you can ssh into the device over USB using
 $ ssh root@192.168.0.202
The password is blank.  You should change it right away
 # passwd

For testing programs running on the Openmoko's display but invoked remotely, you need to specify the display.  E.g.
 # DISPLAY=:0 tangogps

For debugging, you may want to have some programs run on the Openmoko but display on your remote display.  To do that, install:
 # apt-get install xauth

And connect using:
 $ ssh -X root@192.168.0.202

== wifi ==

You can set up the wireless connection to your home router.
Assuming your wireless router uses WPA security and DHCP:
 # apt-get install wireless-tools wpasupplicant dhcp3-client

Edit <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code> to include a section like this:
<pre>
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
       wpa-driver wext
       wpa-ssid "MyWirelessName"
       wpa-psk "MyWirelessPassword"
</pre>
Where, of course, you're using the name of your wireless network and it's password
instead of ''MyWirelessName'' and ''MyWirelessPassword''.

You can test by running
 # ifup eth0

You can determine your IP address by running
 # ifconfig eth0


Issues:
* only works if in presence of wireless network on boot, or when manually running <code>ifup eth0</code>
* booting away from wireless network is slower because waits for DHCP to time out
* does not reestablish connection when leaving wireless area and then returning
* does not support multiple wireless networks or open hotspots that you may travel between

== Suspend ==
To make suspend available you have to install apmd:
 apt-get install apmd
After that you can suspend your phone with:
 apm -s
and make it wake up again with pressing the power button.


Issues:
* [[User:Wuth|Wuth]] 06:28, 17 August 2008 (UTC): I found that apmd was already installed by using the official debian installation procedure, but that the kernel didn't support apm.  I haven't yet resolved this issue.

== Time ==

The default time zone is UTC.  Reconfigure it by running

 # dpkg-reconfigure tzdata

Set the clock manual using, e.g.

 # date -s 00:33


Issues:
* That's probably not sufficient to keep the clock accurate.  It might be worth configuring some form of NTP.

== Tangogps ==

Tangogps is a very nice GPS mapping application.  The latest version is available in Debian.

Unfortunately it depends on gpsd which conflicts with frameworkd in fso-frameworkd.

 # apt-get install gpsd tangogps
  
Edit <code>/etc/frameworkd.conf</code>.  In the section <code>[ogpsd]<code>, edit to read:
<pre>
# path = /dev/ttySAC1
path = /dev/null
</pre>

 # gpsd-reconfigure gpsd

* Start gpsd automatically no boot? Yes.
* Device the GPS receiver is attached to: /dev/ttySAC1
* Should gpsd handle attached USB GPS receivers automatically? Yes
** not certain what this answer should be
* Options to gpsd: none

Start tangogps like this:

 # dbus-send --system --dest=org.freesmartphone.odeviced /org/freesmartphone/Device/PowerControl/GPS org.freesmartphone.Device.PowerControl.SetPower boolean:true
 # DISPLAY=:0 tangogps
