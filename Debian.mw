== Installation ==
There are official instructions on how to install Debian on http://wiki.debian.org/DebianOnFreeRunner, and the [http://lists.linuxtogo.org/pipermail/smartphones-standards/2008-August/000232.html announcement].

Previous, partly now outdated information on how to install Debian manually has been moved to [[Manual Debian]].
== ssh ==

As with the standard Openmoko distribution, you can ssh into the device over USB using
 $ ssh root@192.168.0.202
The password is blank.  You should change it right away
 # passwd

For testing programs running on the Openmoko's display but invoked remotely, you need to specify the display.  E.g.
 # DISPLAY=:0 tangogps

For debugging, you may want to have some programs run on the Openmoko but display on your remote display.  To do that, install:
 # apt-get install xauth

And connect using:
 $ ssh -X root@192.168.0.202

== wifi ==

You can set up the wireless connection to your home router.
Assuming your wireless router uses WPA security and DHCP:
 # apt-get install wireless-tools wpasupplicant dhcp3-client

Edit <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code> to include a section like this:
<pre>
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
       wpa-driver wext
       wpa-ssid "MyWirelessName"
       wpa-psk "MyWirelessPassword"
</pre>
Where, of course, you're using the name of your wireless network and it's password
instead of ''MyWirelessName'' and ''MyWirelessPassword''.

You can test by running
 # ifup eth0

You can determine your IP address by running
 # ifconfig eth0


Issues:
* only works if in presence of wireless network on boot, or when manually running <code>ifup eth0</code>
* booting away from wireless network is slower because waits for DHCP to time out
* does not reestablish connection when leaving wireless area and then returning
* does not support multiple wireless networks or open hotspots that you may travel between

== Suspend ==
To make suspend available you have to install apmd:
 apt-get install apmd
After that you can suspend your phone with:
 apm -s
and make it wake up again with pressing the power button.


Issues:
* [[User:Wuth|Wuth]] 06:28, 17 August 2008 (UTC): I found that apmd was already installed by using the official debian installation procedure, but that the kernel didn't support apm.  I haven't yet resolved this issue.

== Time ==

The default time zone is UTC.  Reconfigure it by running

 # dpkg-reconfigure tzdata

Set the clock manual using, e.g.

 # date -s 00:33


Issues:
* That's probably not sufficient to keep the clock accurate.  It might be worth configuring some form of NTP.

== Tangogps ==

Tangogps is a very nice GPS mapping application.  The latest version is available in Debian.

Unfortunately it depends on gpsd which conflicts with frameworkd in fso-frameworkd.

 # apt-get install gpsd tangogps
  
Edit <code>/etc/frameworkd.conf</code>.  In the section <code>[ogpsd]<code>, edit to read:
<pre>
# path = /dev/ttySAC1
path = /dev/null
</pre>

Reboot to enable this configuration.
* '''Issue:'''  Is there an easier way?

 # dpkg-reconfigure gpsd

* Start gpsd automatically no boot? Yes.
* Device the GPS receiver is attached to: /dev/ttySAC1
* Should gpsd handle attached USB GPS receivers automatically? Yes
** not certain what this answer should be
* Options to gpsd: none


Start tangogps like this:

 # echo 1 >/sys/devices/platform/s3c2440-i2c/i2c-adapter/i2c-0/0-0073/neo1973-pm-gps.0/pwron
Turns the GPS on.

 # DISPLAY=:0 tangogps


'''Issues:'''
* The different daemons for the reading GPS data mean that both tangogps and the framework demo GPS application can't be configured to work at the same time.  Reboots are probably necessary when switching between them.
** Both gpsd and the framework publish GPS data through dbus, though with different interfaces.  This suggests a number of possible solutions.
*** gpsd or the framework could implement the other's interface (along with their own).
*** the framework could have an option to read data from gpsd.
*** tangogps could be extended to read data from the framework.
