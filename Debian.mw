== Installation ==
There are official instructions on how to install Debian on http://wiki.debian.org/DebianOnFreeRunner, and the [http://lists.linuxtogo.org/pipermail/smartphones-standards/2008-August/000232.html announcement].

Previous, partly now outdated information on how to install Debian manually has been moved to [[Manual Debian]].
== ssh ==

As with the standard OpenMoko distribution, you can ssh into the device over USB using
 $ ssh root@192.168.0.202
The password is blank.  You should change it right away
 # passwd

== wireless ==

You can set up the wireless connection to your home router.
Assuming your wireless router uses WPA security and DHCP:
 # apt-get install wireless-tools wpasupplicant dhcp3-client

Edit <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code> to include a section like this:
<pre>
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
       wpa-driver wext
       wpa-ssid "MyWirelessName"
       wpa-psk "MyWirelessPassword"
</pre>
Where, of course, you're using the name of your wireless network and it's password
instead of ''MyWirelessName'' and ''MyWirelessPassword''.

You can test by running
 # ifup eth0

You can determine your IP address by running
 # ifconfig eth0


Issues:
* only works if in presence of wireless network on boot, or when manually running <code>ifup eth0</code>
* does not reestablish connection when leaving wireless area and then returning
* does not support multiple wireless networks or open hotspots that you may travel between

== Suspend ==
To make suspend available you have to install apmd:
 apt-get install apmd
After that you can suspend your phone with:
 apm -s
and make it wake up again with pressing the power button.

[[User:Wuth|Wuth]] 06:28, 17 August 2008 (UTC): I found that apmd was already installed by using the official debian installation procedure, but that the kernel didn't support apm.  I haven't yet resolved this issue.

== Time ==

The default time zone is UTC.  Reconfigure it by running

 # dpkg-reconfigure tzdata

Set the clock manual using, e.g.

 # date -s 00:33

That's probably not sufficient to keep the clock accurate.
It might be worth configuring some form of NTP.
