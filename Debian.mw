Debian is a ''universal operating system'' used on many other embedded devices, and also on home computers. Using Debian on the FreeRunner gives access to the Huge army of software packaged in the Debian repositories, already compiled for the Neo's arm(v4) processor. Moreover, one can build one's own source files for programs without having to learn the OpenEmbedded way. For example compiling natively is a snap with Debian, just apt-get gcc&libc-dev.

For an existing Debian/Ubuntu user, choosing Debian for Neo FreeRunner makes phone a very familiar, trustworthy and flexible place to hack in.

'''The bulk of information related to running Debian on FreeRunner is supposed to be at [http://wiki.debian.org/ wiki.debian.org]. For all installation, support or bug reporting needs please see [http://wiki.debian.org/DebianOnFreeRunner DebianOnFreeRunner] in the Debian wiki.'''

''The current method of installation, install.sh, is not fail-proof. Work is progressing on a real debian-installer support.'' Please be sure Bash is installed before trying install.sh. The main reason why install.sh fails is because it installs debian unstable which is constantly in motion.

== Installation Debian on Freerunner ==
The following steps are a quick installation guide with and installed [[SHR]] on your freerunner and [[Qi]] as bootloader already installed on your freerunner. For further information refer to the [http://wiki.debian.org/DebianOnFreeRunner Debian on Freerunner Wiki] from which this short summary is derived from. 

{{Note|The installation script for Debian, used in the following manual, installs additional software packages in SHR to run a complete Debian installation process. So your [[SHR]] distribution should have some space left. Flash memory with a minimal SHR distribution or remove software packages with [[opkg]].}}

=== Installing Qi ===
The following manual needs [[Qi]] to be installed as bootloader. If you more options for using the bootloader usethe [http://wiki.debian.org/DebianOnFreeRunner Debian on Freerunner Wiki] for further details.
 
Switch off you freerunner (if necessary) and start NOR uBoot by pressing AUX and Power-On at the same time and then start [[dfu-util]] on your desktop computer with the following parameters for GTA2:
  # dfu-util -a u-boot -R -D [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Qi#Download qi-s3c2442-master-hist_3b8513d8b3d9615e.udfu]
See [[Flashing the Neo FreeRunner]] or [[Flashing the Neo 1973]] for more details on flashing your phone.

=== Login to Freerunner with SHR ===
Login to your freerunner with:
 # ssh -X -l root 192.168.0.202
with an [[USB Networking]] connection and an IP-address 192.168.0.202 of your freerunner. Change the IP-address if your network settings differ from this IP-address. Prepare SHR so that you have a working internet connection from your freerunner. This is necessary because SHR will download the Debian packages.

=== Script Installation and Running install.sh ===
Run the following commands from shell in SHR
 # wget -O install.sh http://pkg-fso.alioth.debian.org/freerunner/install.sh
 # chmod +x install.sh
 # TASKS="ALL" QI=true SINGLE_PART=true sh ./install.sh all
The following commands above assumes that you have [[Qi]] installed and you want to use a single partition for Debian on freerunner. The SD card (2GB suggested) will be formated by the script.  If you want to install Debian with different installation parameters please see [http://wiki.debian.org/DebianOnFreeRunner Debian-Wiki] for further details.

{{Note|The installation could take around 50 minutes to complete and you will download approximately 250MB.}}

== Debian Showcase: Desktop Environments And Applications ==

=== fbpanel + Matchbox ===

It is not really a Desktop environment, but using fbpanel with Matchbox you can have a fast, lightweight, gtk2 desktop panel.
[[Image:Debian_fbpanel_zhone.png|right|thumb|150px|Debian with fbpanel, matchbox-window-manager and Zhone running, default settings]]
[[Image:Debian5.png|right|thumb|150px|Custom matchbox theme and fbpanel configuration.]]

Quick howto:
<ol><li>Install fbpanel:
<pre>sudo apt-get install fbpanel hicolor-icon-theme</pre></li>
<li>Customize the X startup process:
<pre>~/.xsession</pre>
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
export GTK_MODULES=libgtkstylus.so
zhone &
xsetroot -solid black
matchbox-keyboard-toggle &
matchbox-window-manager -use_titlebar yes &
# -use_titlebar yes to minimize & toggle between apps
# fbpanel's taskbar does not work with matchbox-window-manager
#~/bin/auxlaunch &
while true;
do
fbpanel;
sleep 1;
done;
</pre></li>

<li>Read http://fbpanel.sourceforge.net/docs.html#config
<pre>~/.fbpanel/default</pre>
<pre>
mkdir ~/.fbpanel
cp /etc/fbpanel/default ~/.fbpanel/default
nano ~/.fbpanel/default
</pre>
Remove section with 'taskbar' plugin - it's useless with matchbox-window-manager. You may add plugin 'cpu'
<pre>Plugin {
type = cpu
}</pre>
Also, plugin 'genmon' is useful:
<pre>Plugin {
type = genmon
config {
Command = echo -e $(grep "MemFree" /proc/meminfo | \
 awk '{printf "%0.2f", $2 / 1024}') "|"\
$(cat /proc/loadavg | awk '{print $3}') "|" \
 $(apm | awk '{print $5}')
PollingTime = 60
TextSize = small
TextColor = darkblue
}
}</pre>
[[Image:Debian6.png|right|thumb|150px|Custom edje Zhone theme. Click to enlarge]]
After 'killall fbpanel' it will show: free mem in megabytes | loadavg | battery % left.</li>
<li>Default theme is ugly. You can change it and / or make fonts bigger:
<pre>~/.gtkrc-2.0</pre>
<pre>sudo apt-cache search gtk2-engines
sudo apt-get install gtk2-engines gtk-theme-switch
DISPLAY=:0 gtk-theme-switch2</pre>
Now choose your theme, font and save it. To see changes do 'killall fbpanel'. (killall requires psmisc package to be installed)</li></ol>

=== Illume ===
[[Image:Debian_illume_zhone.png|right|thumb|150px|Debian with illume, and Zhone running]]
[[Image:Debian_illume_zhone_kb.png|right|thumb|150px|Debian with illume, and Zhone running, with the on-screen keyboard visible]]
[[Illume]], the desktop environment used in recent openmoko distribution releases, is also available under Debian.  It's part of the Enlightenment window manager version 17 (which is currently in the alpha stage of development), which the Debian FSO package maintainers have placed in their repository.  If you have a Debian FSO system running, you can use the following commands to install illume.

 apt-get install e17

Then use the following commands to ensure that it starts on boot.

 apt-get remove zhone-session
 apt-get install nodm
 
 mv /root/.xsession /root/.xsession.backup 
 cat << END > /root/.xsession
 #!/bin/sh
 zhone &
 enlightenment_start
 END

=== LXDE ===

I you want a really nice desktop enviroment but you think XFCE is too fat, you can try to install [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LXDE LXDE]. It give to you the GTK comfort, but use only a fraction of the ram needed by XFCE.
[[Image:Debian_lxde_zhone.png|right|thumb|300px|Debian with lxde and Zhone running]]
To install it:
<pre>apt-get install lxde</pre>

to launch it create a <code>/etc/init.d/lxde</code> script in the same way descripted for xfce4, replacing <code>startxfce4</code> occurrences with <code>startlxde</code>.
<div style="clear:right;">&nbsp;</div>

=== OpenOffice.org ===
[[Image:Freerunner_Debian_runs_openoffice3.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Debian running OpenOffice.org 3]]

Did we already mention you can install ''anything'' in Debian?

<br style="clear:both" />

=== XFCE ===
The debian installation script installs by default the matchbox window manager. It doesn't feature a desktop environment. '''xfce''' is a small and lightweight desktop environment and so is quite fast for the FreeRunner.

<pre>apt-get install xfce4</pre>

Edit your .xsession to launch xfce4 at X startup :

<pre>#!/bin/sh
xfce4-session</pre>

Edit section [Failsafe Session] of /etc/xdg/xfce4-session/xfce4-session.rc (or ~/.config/xfce4-session/xfce4-session.rc) to handle the auto-started apps. For example:
<pre>[Failsafe Session]
Count=3
Client0_Command=xfce4-panel
Client0_PerScreen=False
Client1_Command=xfdesktop
Client1_PerScreen=False
Client2_Command=zhone
Client2_PerScreen=True</pre>
Start XFCE !

<pre>/etc/init.d/nodm restart</pre>

The desktop takes a while to start but once up was snappy as can be expected.
I've not yet looked at the reason for the seemingly too slow start for the desktop.

zhone is available from the "Office" menu in xfce.
The matchbox keyboard is available in "Accessories".

If you want to display the screen on the long side (ie rotated, 4:3 aspect), add the following to the /etc/X11/xorg.conf in both the Device and InputDevice sections :

<pre>Option          "Rotate"                "CCW"</pre>

and then (re)start xfce.

If you want to be able to shutdown/restart the device, add the following line to ''/etc/sudoers'' (don't forget to replace ''username'' with your actual username):
<pre>username localhost = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/xfsm-shutdown-helper</pre>

''' Using matchbox-window-manager with XFCE '''

XFCE's window manager is poorly configured for use with the FreeRunner.  Fortunately, matchbox's window manager is compatible with xfce.  To use the matchbox window manager, modify ~/.xsession as follows:

<pre>#!/bin/sh
exec matchbox-window-manager -use_titlebar no -use_cursor no &
xfce4-session</pre>

== Derivative Distributions of Debian ==

Several distributions are sharing Debian's infrastructure - this is long known. For the Openmoko, 
* [[Fyp]] extends the basic Debian installation while avoiding the need of an SD
* [[Hackable1]] focuses on GNOME Mobile integration
* [[Mer]] : based on [[Maemo]] ; see demo and download image at http://www.newlc.com/en/mer-best-maemo-debianubuntu-mobiles-watch-freerunner-demo
* [[QtMoko]] - Debian with Qt Extended Improved plus configuration changes put manually on top of it
* [[Telefoninux]] http://telefoninux.projects.openmoko.org/index.html
