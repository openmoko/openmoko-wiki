== Mission ==

''Sinergize Telepathy and FSO, providing a broader platform integration, on connectivity, PIM interface, et all, resulting in a richer user experience...''

(yes, it's intended a bit like a joke)

== Ideas ==

* Login == GSM on + pin code
* Logout == GSM off
* Buddies == OPIM contacts
* Messages == protocol specific texting
** tel:XXXX => use SMS
** sip:YYYY => use SIP
** xmpp:YYYY => use XMPP
