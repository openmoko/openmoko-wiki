There's a four-ring 2.5mm stereo jack which provides connectivity to old-fashioned wired headsets.

The headsets used by Motorola smartphones (A780,A1200, ...) and the V-360 have a compatible configuration.

The headsets used by some Nokia phones (N95, ...) have the same jack but they are incompatible. For technical information about rewiring them visit [[Analog wired Headset Nokia]]

The headsets used by Sanyo phones (MVP ESPN,SCP 8400,SCP 2400,SCP 3100,MM-7500 ...) have the same jack and compatible configuration. 

The same is true for Headsets delivered with Sony Ericsson. Here is a short rewiring guide: [[Analog wired Headset Sony Ericsson]].

Dylan proposed a [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-September/029599.html proof of concept scripts] to fix something about the headset insertion/removal being incorrectly acted upon.

== Python mixer to control mic volumes ==

Posted on the Community list Sep 17, 2008; 08:45pm

Angus has written a python mixer to control the mic volumes for the various headsets: "The speaker volumes will be added when I trace their path through the wolfson. It'll currently control handset, wired headset and bluetooth volumes. You currently need to tell it which to control as I have not found any dbus signals to tell what alsa state you are currently in. The displayed volumes may be wrong if you start the volume control before the alsa state change. One you use a control to set its volume it will reflect the state of the underlying hardware."

You'll need these 3 files

 http://handheldshell.com/python-pyalsaaudio_0.3-ml0_armv4t.ipk
 http://handheldshell.com/pymixer.py
 http://handheldshell.com/volume.desktop

install pyalsaausdio and pygtk

 copy pymxer /usr/bin
 copy volume.desktop /usr/share/applications

You can now control mic volume.

Note that this program assumes it can write new alsa scenarios to /usr which needs root access or permissions that allow this. For example in debian these files are not modifiable by normal users.
