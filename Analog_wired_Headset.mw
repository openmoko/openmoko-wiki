There's a four-ring 2.5mm stereo jack which provides connectivity to old-fashioned wired headsets.

The headsets used by Motorola smartphones (A780,A1200, ...) and the V-360 have a compatible configuration.

The headsets used by some Nokia phones (N95, ...) have the same jack but they are incompatible. For technical information about rewiring them visit [[Analog wired Headset Nokia

Dylan proposed a [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-September/029599.html proof of concept scripts] to fix something about the headset insertion/removal being incorrectly acted upon.
