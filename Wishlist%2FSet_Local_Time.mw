Using GPS the phone should adjust the timezone of the phone automatically. When first entering a new timezone the phone should ask if you want to change time zone and adjust the time accordingly.

This requires both a timezone map, and a list of times of changing from summer to wintertime.
It also needs to automatically update, whenever legislation in various countries changes.

You can also get the time from the cell tower. It is called "Network Operator Time".
