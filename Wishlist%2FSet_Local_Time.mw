Using GPS the phone should adjust the timezone of the phone automatically. When first entering a new timezone the phone should ask if you want to change time zone and adjust the time accordingly.

This requires both a timezone map, and a list of times of changing from summer to wintertime.
It also needs to automatically update, whenever legislation in various countries changes.

You can also get the time from the cell tower. It is called "Network Operator Time".

This doesn't necessarily require GPS at all (or any maps) - the Network Operator Time (called out above) is _local time_ - it can therefore be used to calculate a timezone offset from your current settings (assuming a difference in hours with a low error threshold (error >5min unacceptable and requires user input??).
Also, all internal events (calendar, etc...) should be stored in UTC so that they display properly to the user when the timezone changes --[[User:Wisp|wisp]] 08:26, 11 September 2007 (CEST)
