==Playing==

There are balls and spinners. The goal of the game is to finish all the levels by turning off the glowing light in the middle of every spinner on each level. You can turn spinner by clicking center of it. You can push ball out of spinner by clicking it.
The light on the spinners will stop glowing when you manage to fill the slots on the spinners with the right colored marbles. At the beginning of the game this means same colored balls.

As the game progresses, new twists and turns are added to the levels. For example, some levels contain teleporter tiles that will teleport the marbles from the tile to the matching tile somewhere else on the level.
See the in game "Help" menu for pictures of the various tiles and more information.
