The goal of this page is to show you how to run an OpenMoko development image on your host x86 development machine in a chrooted environment.

== Build an image ==

First, you should use [[MokoMakefile|Building OpenMoko using the MokoMakefile]] to build an openmoko-devel-image for your host architecture (x86 in our case). Make sure you put the moko makefile in /home/moko/Makefile .

Prior to that, edit your build/conf/local.conf to make it look like this:

 MACHINE = "qemux86"
 DISTRO = "openmoko"
 BUILD_ARCH = "i686"
 INHERIT += " devshell"
 SRCDATE_eds-dbus = "now"

Once you have built the image, you can start working toward running the image.

== setup the image filesystem ==

The filesystem of the image can be found at /home/moko/build/tmp/rootfs . It is that image that we want to run in a chrooted environment.

We will copy that that rootfs directory somewhere so that subsquent builds (using the MokoMakefile  for instance) don't overwrite it.

Make sure you have root privileges:
 su -

Copy the rootf into a directory called MokoBox. From now on, we will call the chrooted environment a MokoBox.

 cp -r /home/moko/build/tmp/rootfs /home/moko/mokobox

make sure /dev and /proc of the host machine are visible from within mokobox

 mount --bind /dev /homo/moko/mokobox/dev
 mount -t proc none /home/moko/mokobox/proc

start the mokobox

 chroot /homo/moko/mokobox /bin/sh

set environment variables

 DISPLAY=:1
 LANG=C
 HOME=/home/root
 export DISPLAY LANG HOME

In another terminal (not related to mokobox), start Xephyr

 Xephyr :1 -ac
You should see the window of Xephyr now.

Now, back in the mokobox, start an X Session:

 /etc/X11/Xsession

You should see OpenMoko booting in the Xephyr window.
