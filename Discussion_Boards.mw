=Introducion=
This is the place where we discuss about ideas, software development status, long term guidelines, accessibility/usability of the UI, and much other. This should be a precious resource for software developers and distributions maintainers that often does not have time to read  the several mailing lists where discussions normally happens.

It's different from a simple "wish list", here we do brain storming to define the alternatives to achieve the better user experience from the Freerunner.

Feel free to modify everythingh, if you have a different idea add it and start discussion of pro/cons, and above all when you find some progress on the lists report them here!
=UI=
* [[Better handling of AUX/Power buttons]]
* [[Windows Managers]]
