=Introduction=
This is the place where we discuss about ideas, software development status, long term guidelines, accessibility/usability of the UI, and much other. This should be a precious resource for software developers and distributions maintainers that often does not have time to read  the several mailing lists where discussions normally happens.

It's different from a "single shot wish list", here we do brain storming, analyze technical aspects, and give hints to achieve the better user experience with the Freerunner.

Feel free to modify everything. If you have a different idea, add it and start discussion of pro/cons, and above all when you find some progress on the lists report them here!

=UI=
* [[Better handling of AUX/Power buttons]]
* [[Window Managers]]
* [[GUI Usability]]
* [[WiFi Managers]]
