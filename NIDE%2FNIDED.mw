=Introduction=
NIDE/NIDED create a network input device emulator. With that you may transform your freerunner in a virtual keyboard/mouse to control a remote Linux Box.
=How it works=
NIDE is the client part of the architecture, it's a GUI that show you the virtual device (keyboard, mouse, etc), when you trigger some action, eg. button press, it send a command to a remote host where NIDED is installed.

The NIDED daemon create a virtual keyboard/mouse registering a new device in "uinput", reads command sent by NIDE, translates and inijects them in the system.
=Pro=
* it works with every network, bt, wifi, usb and so on
* it may request remote command execution (startup application, halt, reboot, etc.)
* it's xml configurable and stylesheet themable, it's easy to create customized devices
* you may create different pages in the same config file and may switch between them
* every page may have two layouts (portrait, landscape), it auto switches beetween them if you rotate the display (actually with an external application)
* it may use AUX/POWER button to trigger action (simulate button press, request remote command execution, switch between pages and so on)
* there is no need to "initiate" action on the controlled host (as in Remoko)
=Cons=
* it requires nided to be installed on the controlled host, that need linux 2.6 and uinput kernel module
* it uses QT library, and that are not provided in OM2009/SHR, you have to build them yourself or take them from the angstrom feed
* '''no authentication is implemented, a stupid and rude security ip access list is used, so you have to use it in secure networks'''
* it may be buggy in some part and may need bug fixing/code restyling
