'''GameRunner''' is an Openmoko Linux distribution. It aims convert the [[Freerunner]] open mobile phone in a Linux-based handheld game console.

It is simple, and contains cool and suitable open source games for Linux mobile devices.

== Installation ==
There are two installation ways: through MicroSD or flashing 

=== MicroSD ===
You need a 1GB MicroSD and to download the following files:
* [http://sourceforge.net/projects/gamerunner/files/0.3/uImage.bin/download kernel]
* [http://sourceforge.net/projects/gamerunner/files/0.3/gamerunner-rootfs-full-0.3.tar.gz/download full root filesystem]
If your MicroSD is less than 1GB then you can install the minimal rootfs and specific games manually.

* If you use uBoot, you need to create two partitions. First partition, not so big, in FAT16 or ext2 where you have to place the kernel file (uImage.bin) and second partition in ext2 where you have to uncompress the filesystem file (gamerunner-rootfs-X.Y.tar.gz). Some uBoot version reads the "uimage" kernel image file (yes, without .bin and "i", no "I").
* If you use Qi, you only need an ext2 partition into your ÂµSD Card where you uncompress the filesystem image file (gamerunner-rootfs-X.Y.tar.gz).

=== Flashing ===
