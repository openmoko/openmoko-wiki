The Kernel on the GTA01 is based on a vanilla 2.6.17.7 Linux kernel from [http://www.kernel.org/ kernel.org].

Some additional patches are required for
* S3C2410 Usb Device Controller
** We use the driver from iPaq H1409 linux project
* S3C2410 SD Card Controller
** We use the driver from the [http://www.tomtom.com/gpl.php TomTom GO kernel]
* QT2410 machine support
** This is just some glue that puts all pieces together
* S3C2410 touch screen driver
** Again from iPaq H1409 linux project
* GTA01 machine support
** Some glue/configuration to pull all pieces together
* [[GSM Communication Infrastructure]]
** The kernel-level part (TS07.10 line discipline, GPRS line discipline)
