== General ==

The Kernel on the GTA01 is based on a vanilla 2.6.17.7 Linux kernel from [http://www.kernel.org/ kernel.org].

Some additional patches are required for
* S3C2410 Usb Device Controller
** We use the driver from iPaq H1409 linux project
* S3C2410 SD Card Controller
** We use the driver from the [http://www.tomtom.com/gpl.php TomTom GO kernel]
* QT2410 machine support
** This is just some glue that puts all pieces together
* S3C2410 touch screen driver
** Again from iPaq H1409 linux project
* GTA01 machine support
** Some glue/configuration to pull all pieces together
* [[GSM Communication Infrastructure]]
** The kernel-level part (TS07.10 line discipline, GPRS line discipline)


== Kernel Patchset ==

The latest patchset against the abovementioned vanilla kernel can be found at [http://people.gta01.hmw-consulting.de/laforge/src/kernel/current/]. This is a so-called "[http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt quilt] patchset".  In order to apply it, you have to untar it into a "patches" directory below the "linux-2.6.x" directory, and then call "quilt push -a", which pushes all patches onto the kernel.

== Kernel Configuration ==

The latest kernel configuration can be found at [http://people.gta01.hmw-consulting.de/laforge/src/kernel/current/].  Just copy it to the linux-2.6.x/.config file.

== Kernel building ==

The kernel build is executed as normal.  We actually only need the "vmlinux" target, not the "zImage".

== bootable Kernel image ==

A bootable kernel image called ''uImage'' is available from [http://people.gta01.hmw-consulting.de/laforge/src/kernel/current/]

== creating a bootable kernel image ==
u-boot needs all images (such as kernel, initrd, ...) in the form of an uImage.  This is basically just a special header adding CRC protection, version information, etc. Pleaes see [[u-boot]] for details.


== Kernel Boot Parameters ==

The kernel image (once http://people.gta01.hmw-consulting.de/laforge/tmp/qt2410-biglcd.patch is integrated) has a new boot parameter "tft".

If you boot without any tft= parameter, the 'stock' qt2410 240x320 TFT panel is assumed.

If you boot with "tft=b" ('b' for big), the timings for the SHARP 640x480 TFT panel are used.
