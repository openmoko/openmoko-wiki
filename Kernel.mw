== General ==

The Kernel on the GTA01 is based on a vanilla 2.6.21.3 Linux kernel from [http://www.kernel.org/ kernel.org].

Some additional patches are required for
* S3C2410 Usb Device Controller
** We use the driver from iPaq H1940 linux project
* S3C2410 SD Card Controller
** We use the driver from the [http://www.tomtom.com/gpl.php TomTom GO kernel]
* [[QT2410]] machine support
** This is just some glue that puts all pieces together
* S3C2410 touch screen driver
** Again from iPaq H1940 linux project
* GTA01 machine support
** Some glue/configuration to pull all pieces together
* [[GSM Communication Infrastructure]]
** The kernel-level part (TS07.10 line discipline, GPRS line discipline)

== Obtaining the kernel source ==
The openmoko "version" of the kernel can be obtained using git
git clone git://git.openmoko.org/git/kernel.git linux-2.6
cd linux-2.6
git checkout origin/stable
According to [http://git.openmoko.org/?p=kernel.git;a=summary OpenMoko git web interface] you should checkout origin/andy, but according to Andy Green himself it is "normally nowadays you want to checkout origin/stable".

The web interface also contains a list of other heads (branches) available.

== Kernel Configuration ==

Before you start the build of the kernel you need to configure it.

A good place to start are the predefined configurations. ''defconfig-gta01'' and ''defconfig-gta02'' are some of the more interesting configurations. They are available inside the checkout of the source.

You just copy one of the configuration files into .config

To customize the configuration use ''make menuconfig''

== Kernel building ==

The kernel build is executed as normal.  We actually only need the "vmlinux" target, not the "zImage".

More current information about building the kernel is currently on the [[Toolchain]] page.

== Prebuilt kernel images ==

Prebuilt bootable kernel images called ''uImage*'' are available from:
* http://downloads.openmoko.org/distro/releases/Om2008.9/
For full operation on the currently supported platforms you need some modules inside the rootfs. You can either get a ''modules*'' archive from the above mentioned location (with the same version number) which contains many more modules then you might need.

Alternatively you can check the following location
for prepackaged modules for the kernel version and install them using ipkg:
* http://downloads.openmoko.org/

Latest images can always be found here: http://downloads.openmoko.org/distro/releases/

=== Modules for the Neo1973 GTA01 ===

On the Neo1973 the following modules should be added to support most of the hardware:
* snd-soc-neo1973-wm8753 snd-soc-s3c24xx-i2s snd-soc-s3c24xx snd-soc-wm8753
* ohci-hcd
* bluetooth hci-usb
* fat vfat msdos nsl-base nls_iso8859_1 nls_cp437

These really should be in the unmodified root image to start with. See bug 580.

You'll probably have to put these in a file in /etc/modutils/ and run update-modules to get them to work automatically.

* hci_usb
* s3cmci
* snd-soc-neo1973-wm8753

== Creating a bootable kernel image ==
u-boot needs all images (such as kernel, initrd, ...) in the form of an uImage.  This is basically just a special header adding CRC protection, version information, etc. Please see [[u-boot]] for details.

== Kernel Boot Parameters ==

Since the [[QT2410]] can be used with different liquid crystal modules (LCMs), the kernel images for the QT2410 have a boot parameter "tft":
* If you boot without any tft= parameter, the 'stock' qt2410 240x320 TFT panel is assumed.
* If you boot with "tft=b" ('b' for big), the timings for the SHARP 8" 640x480 TFT panel are used.
* If you boot with "tft=p" ('p' for production), the timings for the 2.8" 480x640 TFT panel are used.

== Kernel Subsystems ==

In this section we will outline a couple of the GTA01 specific kernel drivers / features / subsystems

=== GSM ===

==== Power Management ====

The '''gta01_pm_gsm''' driver implements GSM power management (this means, if this is compiled as a module, you have to load the gta01_pm_gsm.ko module first)

It exports the following sysfs based interface
<pre>
root@fic-gta01:/$ ls -l /sys/bus/platform/devices/gta01-pm-gsm.0/
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root         4096 Feb  1 09:58 download
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root         4096 Feb  1 09:58 power_on
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root         4096 Feb  1 09:58 reset
</pre>

===== Powering up/down =====
<pre>
root@fic-gta01:~$ echo "1" > /sys/bus/platform/devices/gta01-pm-gsm.0/power_on
gta01-pm-gsm gta01-pm-gsm.0: powering up GSM, thus disconnecting serial console

root@fic-gta01:~$ echo "0" > /sys/bus/platform/devices/gta01-pm-gsm.0/power_on
gta01-pm-gsm gta01-pm-gsm.0: powered down GSM, thus enabling serial console
</pre>

Note that powering up GSM <b>disables</b> the console.

===== Resetting =====
<pre>
root@fic-gta01:~$ echo "1" > /sys/bus/platform/devices/gta01-pm-gsm.0/reset
root@fic-gta01:~$ echo "0" > /sys/bus/platform/devices/gta01-pm-gsm.0/reset
</pre>

===== Activating GSM baseband download mode =====
<pre>
root@fic-gta01:~$ echo "1" > /sys/bus/platform/devices/gta01-pm-gsm.0/download
</pre>

===== De-activating GSM baseband download mode =====
<pre>
root@fic-gta01:~$ echo "0" > /sys/bus/platform/devices/gta01-pm-gsm.0/download
</pre>

=== GPS ===

==== Power Management ====

The gta01_pm_gps kernel driver offers a sysfs based interface:
<pre>
root@fic-gta01:~$ ls -l /sys/bus/platform/devices/gta01-pm-gps.0/
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root         4096 Feb  1 09:14 power_avdd_3v
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root         4096 Feb  1 09:14 power_lp_io_3v3
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root         4096 Feb  1 09:14 power_pll_core_2v5
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root            0 Feb  1 09:14 power_sequence
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root         4096 Feb  1 09:14 power_vtxco_2v8
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root         4096 Feb  1 09:14 pwron
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root         4096 Feb  1 09:14 reset
</pre>

The power_avdd_3v, power_lp_io_3v3, power_pll_core_2v5, power_vtxco_2v8, pwron and reset files represent the state of the respective signal.

The <b>power_sequence</b> file implements power-up/power-down sequence in accordance with the GlobalLocate data sheet.

===== Powering up =====
root@fic-gta01:~$ echo "power_up" > /sys/bus/platform/devices/gta01-pm-gps.0/power_sequence
===== Powering down =====
root@fic-gta01:~$ echo "power_down" > /sys/bus/platform/devices/gta01-pm-gps.0/power_sequence

=== Asound driver ===

==== High-level requirements ====

The GTA01 audio subsystem is fairly complex, even though the high-level requirements for the sound driver are simple.
The features we need to support

* voice call support
** passing through the microphone signal to the GSM Modem
** passing through the GSM Modem audio output to the integrated speaker(s)
** the microphone input mixer gain will be statically configured according to the dynamic requirements
** the audio volume that is sent to the GSM modem can be adjusted via line out level
** the audio volume incoming (from GSM modem -> codec) can be adjusted via speaker out level
* voice call recording support
** the user is able to record phone conversations on digital storage inside the phone. Format will be ogg (not important to driver)
** ideally, the user can choose between recording only incoming or outgoing signal, or both.
** for both, we'd need to mix both microphone and line-in signals before recording. is this possible?
* voice call playback support
** the user is able to playback recorded files during a conversation.  this means that PCM playback needs to be mixed with mic input before being passed to line-out (and to the GSM modem)
* media playback support
** an audio player can play back mp3/ogg/flac/... files and output sound via integrated speakers or headphone
* headphone jack switch
** this is connected to a GPIO of the S3C2410. How to best integrate this with the sound driver? It should just be handled like any other headphone jack reporting of e.g. laptop computers.

For more details see [[Neo1973 Audio Subsystem]]

=== Bluetooth ===

We're using the stock bluez implementation of the linux kernel.

==== Power Management ====

The bluetooth basically has the following preconditions
* BT_EN being set
* The Voltage regulator set up properly
* The ohci-hcd driver being loaded

The gta01_pm_bt driver implements the following files:
<pre>
root@fic-gta01:/$ ls -l /sys/bus/platform/devices/gta01-pm-bt.0
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root         4096 Feb  1 09:52 power_on
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root         4096 Feb  1 09:52 reset
</pre>

===== Powering up the device =====

<pre>
root@fic-gta01:/$ echo "1" > /sys/bus/platform/devices/gta01-pm-bt.0/power_on
usb 1-1: new full speed USB device using s3c2410-ohci and address 4
usb 1-1: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
</pre>

===== Powering down the device =====
<pre>
root@fic-gta01:/$ echo "0" > /sys/bus/platform/devices/gta01-pm-bt.0/power_on
usb 1-1: USB disconnect, address 3
</pre>

===== Asserting reset (low-active) =====
<pre>
root@fic-gta01:/$ echo "0" >  /sys/bus/platform/devices/gta01-pm-bt.0/reset
root@fic-gta01:/$ usb 1-1: USB disconnect, address 2
</pre>

===== De-asserting reset (low-active) =====
<pre>
root@fic-gta01:/$ echo "1" >  /sys/bus/platform/devices/gta01-pm-bt.0/reset
s3c2410-ohci s3c2410-ohci: wakeup

=== AUX Button ===

The AUX button (formerly 911 button) is supported via the "gta01kbd" driver in the kernel (drivers/input/keyboard/gta01kbd.c).

It creates an input event device that only issues "KEY_PHONE" press/unpress events.

=== Power Management Unit (PMU) ===

The PMU is supported via the "pcf50606" driver in the kernel (drivers/i2c/chips/pcf50606.c).

This driver provides a number of userspace interfaces for the various bits and pieces of the PMU

==== Power Button, Charger insertion ====

The PMU creates an input device that supports the following keys:
* KEY_POWER: power button of GTA01
* KEY_POWER2: USB power supply insert/remove
* KEY_BATTERY: Charger insert/remove

==== RTC ====

The real-time clock, including the alarm feature, is implemented as standard RTC (/dev/rtc).

==== Watchdog ====

The PMU-integrated watchdog is implemented using the standard watchdog character device.

==== Voltage Regulators ====

The voltage regulators are exported to userspace using sysfs, much like lm_sensors.

Every regulator can be read (and written!).  The format is ASCII in millivolts.

<pre>

root@fic-gta01:/sys/devices/platform/s3c2410-i2c/i2c-0/0-0008$ cat voltage_dcd
1300
</pre>

==== Battery Voltage ====

The battery voltage (in millivolts) can be read via sysfs

<pre>
root@fic-gta01:~$ cat /sys/bus/i2c/devices/0-0008/battvolt
3767
</pre>

==== Battery charging current ====

The battery charging current (in milliamperes) can be read via sysfs

<pre>
root@fic-gta01:~$ cat /sys/bus/i2c/devices/0-0008/chgcur
0
</pre>

==== Battery temperature ====

The battery temperature (in centigrades) can be read via sysfs

<pre>
root@fic-gta01:~$ cat /sys/bus/i2c/devices/0-0008/battemp
25
</pre>

=== Backlight ===

We provide a driver that supports the linux kernel standard backlight API. You can find the respective sysfs files in /sys/class/backlight/

=== Vibrator ===

The vibrator driver is implemented as a LED driver.  You can find the respective sysfs files in /sys/class/leds/.
The vibrator classdev name is '''gta01:vibrator'''.

Please note, depending on the kernel version, the driver only supports on/off or PWM of the vibrator device.  If you want to run the vibrator at full power, use
<pre>
root@fic-gta01:~$ echo "255" > /sys/class/leds/gta01\:vibrator/brightness
</pre>

== GTA02 /sys mappings for andy-tracking vs stable ==
The kernel that is currently in development changes some paths around /sys, so userspace must be prepared for a change.

Here are the current /sys mappings for andy-tracking (which has Balaji's
regulator PMU stuff).  The reason virtually everything has changed is
mainly due to the device tree changes to fix suspend - resume, many more
things have a child relationship to the PMU now.
