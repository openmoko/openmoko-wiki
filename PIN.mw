'''PIN''' stands for ''Personnal Identification Number''

Would anyone document how one can change the PIN using the freerunner ?

Maybe see : "How to change SIM card PIN code, PUK code in a heartbeat" : http://www.infosyncworld.com/news/n/6567.html

as the above mentioned page seriously sucks with greedy plugins, here a (corrected) quote:

Change SIM Card PIN 

 **04*<old PIN>*<new PIN>*<new PIN># 

Change SIM Card PIN 2 (Write down the new code) 

 **042*<old PIN2>*<new PIN2>*<new PIN2># 

Change SIM Card PUK (Write down the new code) 

 **05*<old PUK>*<new PUK>*<new PUK># 

Change SIM Card PUK 2 (Write down the new code) 

 **052*<old PUK2>*<new PUK2>*<new PUK2>#
