== Summary ==
Glamo3362 is the graphics chip in the [[Neo FreeRunner]].  It supports 2D and 3D acceleration, and provides an extra SD interface which is used for the uSD card slot (the other one is used for the [[Wlan]] adaptor).

Glamo's 2D engine is currently used to accelerate solid fills and blits in both XGlamo (Kdrive) and X.org (xf86-video-glamo).

The datasheets for the chip are not public, but have been made available (under NDA) to a few community volunteers who are interested in working on accelerated drivers.  Please post to the [http://lists.openmoko.org/mailman/listinfo/devel devel mailing list] if you are interested in joining in this effort.  [http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/openmoko-community/2008/11/13/4088744 This mailing list thread] has some discussion on the topic.

== MicroSD support ==
* Supports SDHC (Secure Digital High Capacity) cards up to 8GB
* Connected to: Glamo 3362 MMC/SD controller
* [[Supported microSD cards]]
* Specifications: [http://www.sdcard.org/about/memory_card/pls/ SD Simplified Specification], [http://www.mmca.org/compliance/buy_spec/AN_MMCA050419.pdf MMC (partial)], [http://www.sandisk.com/Assets/File/OEM/Manuals/manual-rs-mmcv1.0.pdf MMC (product manual)]

== Bus Interface ==
* Glamo is connected to the [[Samsung S3C2442B B54]] address/data bus, accessed via MMIO.

== Hardware Acceleration ==
This is a compilation of all the publicly available information that is known about the Glamo 3362 used in the Neo FreeRunner GTA02 and links to past and present projects utilizing the Glamo's hardware acceleration.  If anyone is working or has worked on hardware acceleration with the Glamo please add any links and any further information to this page.

===Known Features===
* 8MB internal SDRAM
* 16bit local bus interface to S3C2410
** The bus is limited in speed to about 7 Mb/s. This means that rendering is slow unless it can follow an accelerated path, and that texture uploads for 3D graphics would be slow.
* 2D acceleration
* 3D acceleration
** 256x256 Max Texture Size
** No Render-To-Texture Support
** 511x511 Max 3D Destination Buffer Size
*** Note that this is smaller than the VGA screen.
** Pipeline: Transform, cull, lighting, clipping, setup, rasterizer
** Standards compliance: OpenGL ES 1.0, OpenGL ES 1.1 and Mobile D3D.
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.263 h.263] codec (encode/decode)
* LCM controller
* SD-Card controller
* hardware JPEG encoder/decoder
* Camera interface and imapge processing (unused)
