==Introduction==

Intone is an elementary based front end for mplayer written in C.

The recommended way to organise music is to put all the files in a folder (lets say Music), with sub folders named after artists (say Music ->Eagles) and with sub sub folders holding albums (that becomes Music->Eagles->Hell Freezes Over->*.mp3). That way, Intone can correctly organise your music collection into albums. It automatically creates a default playlist containing all songs and individual playlists for each album.

==Libraries==

Intone requires and updated version of elementary and libsqlite3. If you have elementary on your phone upgraded to a level where the elementary test application shows you a demo of sliders and genlists, Intone should run on your phone.

===To Install===

opkg install libsqlite3-0 libelementary0 http://www.opkg.org/packages/intone_0.24_arm.ipk

===mPlayer===

I have been using this[http://downloads.freesmartphone.org/fso-unstable/feeds/armv4t/mplayer_0.0+1.0rc2-r12_armv4t.ipk] version of mplayer from FSO.

PaulTT has compiled a version of mplayer with tremor available here[http://www.paultt.org/downloads/openmoko/mplayer_dev-SVN-r29155-4.1.2_armv4t.ipk].
