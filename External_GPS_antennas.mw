The purpose of this site is to give an overview over Neo1973 compatible GPS antennas 

== Navilock NL-65AT MMCX ==
The Navilock [http://www.navilock.de/produkte/gruppen/12/Zusatz_Antennen/61232_AT-65_MMCX.html NL-65AT MMCX] is an active GPS antenna from the company [http://www.navilock.de Navilock].
According to the manufacturer it has following specifications:
 * dimensions 40,5 x 38,0 x 12,3 mm
 * 2m connection cable with MMCX plug
 * power consumption:
   * with 3V 12mA
   * with 5V 18mA

The antenna is tested shortly, the input signal increased by a factor of 4 in a car.

== Haicom GPS-AHI-101 ==
The Haicom GPS-AHI-101 have these specifications:
 * dimensions: 50 x 50 x 17 mm
 * 5 m connection cable with MMCX plug
 * mounting: magnetic base
 * Power handling: 1 Watt

A brief test (hanging the antenna out of the window in my apartment) show that it works quite well. TTFF in 216 seconds, 6 satellites in view.
Note: I used my [[Neo FreeRunner|FreeRunner]] to do the test, I haven't tested the antenna with my [[Neo 1973]] yet.

== Arkon External GPS Antenna with MMCX connector ==
Chepeast I found, just $12,50 at [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F1WNAO amazon.com]
The link will suggest other products alike.
There are no clear specs, tested in the FR with tangoGPS and got TTFF in few seconds with a clear sky, picks 10 sats.
