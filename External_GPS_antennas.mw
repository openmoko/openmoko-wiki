The purpose of this page is to give an overview on using external GPS antennas.

The connector for both the Neo 1973 and the Neo FreeRunner is the same, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMCX MMCX], but 
the GPS chipset has been changed. Even though the antennas listed here will probably work on either Neo, they have been separated out according to what has actually been tested.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_first_fix TTFF (Time To First Fix)] and number of satellites locked in will vary greatly depending on the current conditions (the constellation of the satellites, terrain and buildings, and weather). To do a serious comparison test we would need to test all the antennas at the same time under known conditions. Currently this page will just tell you some antennas that have been found to function with the Neo FreeRunner and Neo 1973. 

== Neo FreeRunner ==

=== Arkon External GPS Antenna with MMCX connector ===

$12,50 at [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F1WNAO amazon.com]
The Amazon link will suggest other similar products.
There are no clear specs, tested in the FR with tangoGPS and got TTFF in few seconds with a clear sky, picks 10 sats.

=== Haicom GPS-AHI-101 ===

The Haicom GPS-AHI-101 have these specifications:
* dimensions: 50 x 50 x 17 mm
* 5 m connection cable with MMCX plug
* mounting: magnetic base
* Power handling: 1 Watt

A brief test (hanging the antenna out of the window in my apartment) show that it works quite well. TTFF in 216 seconds, 6 satellites in view.

=== Semsons external antenna ===

No brand name. [http://www.semsons.com/gps90deexboa.html Item #GPS-ANT-MMCX(90)]
Tested briefly outdoors, seems to work fine. (Will do more testing later.)
 Purchased on 23 Jul 08 for $10,99 + $5 shipping.

* 90 degrees MMCX connector
* Magnetic base and water resistant

The 90 degree connector is very handy, the wire does not stick straight out the side of the FR so it's easier to hold in your hand with the cable attached.

=== Navilock NL-65AT MMCX ===

The Navilock [http://www.navilock.de/produkte/gruppen/12/Zusatz_Antennen/61232_AT-65_MMCX.html NL-65AT MMCX] is an active GPS antenna from the company [http://www.navilock.de Navilock].
According to the manufacturer it has following specifications:
* dimensions 40,5 x 38,0 x 12,3 mm
* 2m connection cable with MMCX plug
* power consumption:
** with 3V 12mA
** with 5V 18mA

The antenna was only tested briefly, the input signal increased by a factor of 4 in a car.
