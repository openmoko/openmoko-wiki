The current status of the SIM cards provided by AT&T is that many 3G SIM cards are problematic with the neo1973 SH1. This issue is known and there is a bug report for tracking progress: http://bugzilla.openmoko.org/cgi-bin/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=666)

Below are two tables to help users report their success or failure. If your card is not listed or have different results, please update the tables below.

(Note: When adding to the tables, please do not include the 20 digit ICCID, as this is your SIM's unique id. If you do your phone company will be able to track you down and 1984 may overpower 1973)

== Pick Your Plan Options ==
ATT's GoPhones also have a "Pick Your Plan" option described here:
http://www.wireless.att.com/cell-phone-service/go-phones/pyp-plans-phones.jsp

These plans require no contract and have an option to get unlimited data transfer for $19.99/mo.  
This may be the cheapest non-contract method to get unlimited data.  
If someone tries this, please confirm that the SIM card that comes with these GoPhones can be transferred to an Openmoko device.

* Media Max 200 Bundle: Includes unlimited data and 200 text messages for $19.99/month. This is in addition to regular voice service and is tied to a specific SIM card and phone number (doesn't give all family plan members unlimited data).
* ATT offers data access on *Every* plan, '''including prepay'''. If you don't have a data access "plan", you are billed $0.01/KB for transfer. Expect all transfers to be rounded in the carriers favor.
