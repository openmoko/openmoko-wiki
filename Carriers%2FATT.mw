== GoPhone Pay As You Go (Prepay for minutes) ==
AT&T Wireless [http://www.wireless.att.com/cell-phone-service/go-phones/pyg-plans-phones.jsp Pay As You Go] service offers a prepaid phone service, in which money is added to a subscriber's account by purchasing phone cards of varying values, and is deducted from the subscriber's account according to published rates.  In addition to exhaustion from use, the account balance purchased with a phone card expires after 30 days for a card under $25, 90 days for a card with value between $25 and $75, or 365 days for a $100 card. Any unused balance is forfeited at expiration, however any existing balance is carried over when the expiration date is extended by purchase of a new card.  The subscriber's phone number is lost if the account expires.

Currently, the AT&T Wireless offers the following voice rate plans for Pay As You Go service:

Data Access:  As of 12 Nov 2008, AT&T are canceling the Pay As You Go MediaNet Unlimited data service and forcing those who want unlimited data to obtain one of their contract plans, according to a text message sent to subscribers.  Options remain for paltry 1MB and 5MB per month, but routine use (for example, downloading GPS maps) may exhaust these within hours or days.  With no data plan, or with an exhausted data plan, AT&T currently charges an outrageous $0.01/kB for data access.  This charge is deducted from your pool of remaining minutes.

== GoPhone Pick Your Plan (Prepay per month) ==
AT&T's GoPhone also has a [http://www.wireless.att.com/cell-phone-service/go-phones/pyp-plans-phones.jsp Pick Your Plan] service, by which users prepay a static fee per month for a package of minutes and other options.  The packages are similar to AT&T's contract plans, except there is no fixed-term contract and subscribers may cancel at any time.  Every month, the subscriber's account balance is renewed by automated prepayment, with Anytime minutes rolling over.  If the account balance is exhausted before the end of the month, additional minutes can be purchased via another prepayment.

=== GoPhone Pick Your Plan Testimonials ===

I bought the AT&T GoPhone package from Best Buy for $14.99 that includes the Motorola c168i. This phone came with the Blazing Fireball 3G SIM 71234 O 4022, and it works with my FreeRunner.  I have made and received calls and have received SMS text messages using this SIM card on AT&T's Pick Your Plan service.
