== [http://www.wireless.att.com/ AT&T] ==

The current status of the SIM cards provided by AT&T is that many 3G SIM cards are problematic with the neo1973 SH1. This issue is known and there is a bug report for tracking progress: http://bugzilla.openmoko.org/cgi-bin/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=666)

Below are two tables to help users report their success or failure. If your card is not listed or have different results, please update the tables below.

(Note: When adding to the tables, please do not include the 20 digit ICCID, as this is your SIM's unique id. If you do your phone company will be able to track you down and 1984 may overpower 1973)

|-
| 71234 || O || 4022 || blazing 3G fireball || WalMart/RadioShack $18 Cingular Go phone package. This chip was also given with a contract plan. (Three confirmed working.)[17 July 08 confirmed 4th working w/Family 500 anytime]
|-
| 71234 || O || 4022 || blazing 3G fireball || RadioShack $15 AT&T Go phone package. Also had to purchase minimum $15 of minutes. Works great out of box no problems. (August 19, 2008)
|-
| 71234 || O || 4022 || blazing 3G fireball || Two more confirmed working with FreeRunner.  Previous 4021 chip did not work properly.
|-
| 71234 || O || 4022 || blazing 3G fireball || It only partially worked, at first. (I had reception, but it always said "Registering..." in the upper-left of the screen.) After wiggling the sim card slightly, and rebooting the phone, it eventually changed from &quot;Registering&quot; to &quot;AT&amp;T&quot;.
|-
| 71234 || O || 4022 || blazing 3G fireball || changed to this after reliability problems with 71234_G_3022 SIM. *This* SIM seems to always connect immediately without powering GSM down&up. Same SIM model as purchased on eBay, but AT&T traded this one for free.
|-
| 73000 || O || 4021 || blazing 3G fireball || tried it using libgsm-tool -m shell (O, R). Just have to wait for 30-40 sec after registering. Then you can make calls consistently.
|-
| 73000 || G || 3021 || blazing 3G fireball || Works with FreeRunner, but placement of SIM is the key. Shifted it slightly down and it registers reliably

I had a non-compatible SIM card, but it took only a few minutes in an AT&T Store to have them bring up my account, give me a new card, and double check that it works. They generally seem friendly, and it's pretty easy. Just say "Hi, I have an unlocked phone, and my current SIM card doesn't work. Is there any way that I can get another one?"

Note: AT&T claims they cannot reactivate a previously deactivated SIM card. The CSR may give you the choice to force the activation at the risk of losing the current phone number! A word of warning.

Also Note: AT&T stores said no longer carry anything but the "newer" 3G Fireball SIM cards (Aug 18,2008). It is also a good idea to chek the pin placement. If the pins are not centered on the chip there is a good chance that it will not work. The following link has a number of picture references for working and non-working 3G SIMs [http://bugzilla.openmoko.org/cgi-bin/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=666 Ticket #666 (new defect)]

Question: Suppose you have a SIM card listed on the does NOT work chart.  How can one buy one of the SIM cards that does work?

Answer: A 71234(O)/4022 SIM can be had on ebay for $4 including shipping at
http://cgi.ebay.com/ATT-3G-SIM-CARD-4-SALE-BRAND-NEW-COMMISSIONABLE-SWAP_W0QQitemZ270245436267QQihZ017QQcategoryZ29778QQrdZ1QQssPageNameZWD1VQQcmdZViewItem
I have received this SIM and it works. Yay.

I just bought a SIM card from this eBay guy and while I got it fast, it was an incompatible one.  His auction states "SKU: 71234", but it does not specify 4022 or 4021.  While others may get a 4022, I received a 4021.  Make sure you ask him before you purchase!

I also bought this same SIM card, the eBay seller has prompt shipping and good prices.  When you get the SIM card simply call customer support on a different phone and have your old and new sim cards out of the phone so you can give the 20 digit ID number to activate the new card.  The activation is almost instantaneous.  I highly recommend this cheap and easy solution if you have an unsupported SIM.

I'm one more person that bought this card, except that I did not have one yet and I wanted to get one that I knew would work.  You don't have to call customer support to activate it if you are not swapping, you can just go here https://www.wireless.att.com/activations/.

== Pick Your Plan Options ==
ATT's GoPhones also have a "Pick Your Plan" option described here:
http://www.wireless.att.com/cell-phone-service/go-phones/pyp-plans-phones.jsp

These plans require no contract and have an option to get unlimited data transfer for $19.99/mo.  This may be the cheapest non-contract method to get unlimited data.  NOTE: As of 12 Nov 2008, AT&T are canceling the Pick Your Plan MediaNet Unlimited data service and forcing those who want unlimited data to obtain one of their extortionate contracts.

I bought the AT&T GoPhone package from Best Buy for $14.99 that includes the Motorola c168i. This phone came with the Blazing Fireball 3G SIM 71234 O 4022, and it works with my FreeRunner.  I have made and received calls and have received SMS text messages using this SIM card on AT&T's Pick Your Plan service.

* Media Max 200 Bundle: Includes unlimited data and 200 text messages for $19.99/month. This is in addition to regular voice service and is tied to a specific SIM card and phone number (doesn't give all family plan members unlimited data).
* ATT offers data access on *Every* plan, '''including prepay'''. If you don't have a data access "plan", you are billed $0.01/KB for transfer. Expect all transfers to be rounded in the carriers favor.
