== AT&T ==

The current status of the SIM cards provided by AT&T is unknown. There have been no solid reports that the provided SIM is working. There have been countless reports that the AT&T provided SIM cards '''Do Not Work'''. (See bug report: http://bugzilla.openmoko.org/cgi-bin/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=666)

The sim with number 71234 and 4021 on the front with a picture of a blazing 3G fireball is mfged by http://www.oberthurcs.com/getpage.aspx?id=65#application (I think, I was told the 4 in 4021 was their vendor ID). Please look at their website for more info.

(Note: When adding to the tables, please do not include the 20 digit ICCID, as this is your SIM's unique id)
