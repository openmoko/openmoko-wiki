= Status of AT&T SIM Cards =

The current status of the SIM cards provided by AT&T is that many 3G SIM cards are problematic with the neo1973 SH1. This issue is known and there is a [http://bugzilla.openmoko.org/cgi-bin/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=666 bug report] for tracking progress.

Below are two tables to help users report their success or failure. If your card is not listed or have different results, please update the tables below.

(Note: When adding to the tables, please do not include the 20 digit ICCID, as this is your SIM's unique id. If you do your phone company will be able to track you down and 1984 may overpower 1973)

After wiggling the SIM card slightly, and rebooting the phone, it eventually changed from &quot;Registering&quot; to &quot;AT&amp;T&quot;.  (Note: This registering annoyance is likely due more to the OM2007.2 distribution rather than the SIM card.  I had the problem too, but upgrading to OM2008.9 solved it.)

I had a non-compatible SIM card, but it took only a few minutes in an AT&T Store to have them bring up my account, give me a new card, and double check that it works. They generally seem friendly, and it's pretty easy. Just say "Hi, I have an unlocked phone, and my current SIM card doesn't work. Is there any way that I can get another one?"

Note: AT&T claims they cannot reactivate a previously deactivated SIM card. The CSR may give you the choice to force the activation at the risk of losing the current phone number! A word of warning.

Also Note: AT&T stores said no longer carry anything but the "newer" 3G Fireball SIM cards (Aug 18,2008). It is also a good idea to chek the pin placement. If the pins are not centered on the chip there is a good chance that it will not work. The following link has a number of picture references for working and non-working 3G SIMs [http://bugzilla.openmoko.org/cgi-bin/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=666 Ticket #666 (new defect)]

Question: Suppose you have a SIM card listed on the does NOT work chart.  How can one buy one of the SIM cards that does work?

Answer: A 71234(O)/4022 SIM can be had for $4 including shipping at
[http://cgi.ebay.com/ATT-3G-SIM-CARD-4-SALE-BRAND-NEW-COMMISSIONABLESWAP_W0QQitemZ270245436267QQihZ017QQcategoryZ29778QQrdZ1QQssPageNameZWD1VQQcmdZViewItem ebay].
I have received this SIM and it works. Yay.

I just bought a SIM card from this eBay guy and while I got it fast, it was an incompatible one.  His auction states "SKU: 71234", but it does not specify 4022 or 4021.  While others may get a 4022, I received a 4021.  Make sure you ask him before you purchase!

I also bought this same SIM card, the eBay seller has prompt shipping and good prices.  When you get the SIM card simply call customer support on a different phone and have your old and new SIM cards out of the phone so you can give the 20 digit ID number to activate the new card.  The activation is almost instantaneous.  I highly recommend this cheap and easy solution if you have an unsupported SIM.

I'm one more person that bought this card, except that I did not have one yet and I wanted to get one that I knew would work.  You don't have to call customer support to activate it if you are not swapping, you can just go here https://www.wireless.att.com/activations/.

== GoPhone Pay As You Go (Prepay for minutes) ==
AT&T Wireless [http://www.wireless.att.com/cell-phone-service/go-phones/pyg-plans-phones.jsp Pay As You Go] service offers a prepaid phone service, in which money is added to a subscriber's account by purchasing phone cards of varying values, and is deducted from the subscriber's account according to published rates.  In addition to exhaustion from use, the account balance purchased with a phone card expires after 30 days for a card under $25, 90 days for a card with value between $25 and $75, or 365 days for a $100 card. Any unused balance is forfeited at expiration, however any existing balance is carried over when the expiration date is extended by purchase of a new card.  The subscriber's phone number is lost if the account expires.

Currently, the AT&T Wireless offers the following voice rate plans for Pay As You Go service:

{| class="wikitable sortable" style="margin: 0em " cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" border="1"
|Rate
|Daily Access Fee*
|Mobile to Mobile Minutes
|-
|$.10/minute
|$1.00 per day, ONLY on days you use your phone

Data Access:  As of 12 Nov 2008, AT&T are canceling the Pay As You Go MediaNet Unlimited data service and forcing those who want unlimited data to obtain one of their contract plans, according to a text message sent to subscribers.  Options remain for paltry 1MB and 5MB per month, but routine use (for example, downloading GPS maps) may exhaust these within hours or days.  With no data plan, or with an exhausted data plan, AT&T currently charges an outrageous $0.01/kB for data access.  This charge is deducted from your pool of remaining minutes.

== GoPhone Pick Your Plan (Prepay per month) ==
AT&T's GoPhone also has a [http://www.wireless.att.com/cell-phone-service/go-phones/pyp-plans-phones.jsp Pick Your Plan] service, by which users prepay a static fee per month for a package of minutes and other options.  The packages are similar to AT&T's contract plans, except there is no fixed-term contract and subscribers may cancel at any time.  Every month, the subscriber's account balance is renewed by automated prepayment, with Anytime minutes rolling over.  If the account balance is exhausted before the end of the month, additional minutes can be purchased via another prepayment.

=== GoPhone Pick Your Plan Testimonials ===

I bought the AT&T GoPhone package from Best Buy for $14.99 that includes the Motorola c168i. This phone came with the Blazing Fireball 3G SIM 71234 O 4022, and it works with my FreeRunner.  I have made and received calls and have received SMS text messages using this SIM card on AT&T's Pick Your Plan service.
