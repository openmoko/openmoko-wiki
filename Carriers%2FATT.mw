== AT&T ==

The current status of the SIM cards provided by AT&T is unknown. There have been no solid reports that the provided SIM is working. There have been countless reports that the AT&T provided SIM cards '''Do Not Work'''. (See bug report: http://bugzilla.openmoko.org/cgi-bin/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=666)

For info on the 71234 4021 see http://www.oberthurcs.com/getpage.aspx?id=65#application

(Note: When adding to the tables, please do not include the 20 digit ICCID, as this is your SIM's unique id. If you do you phone company will be able to track you down and 1984 may overpower 1973)
