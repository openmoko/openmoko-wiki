Adobe Flash is not supported on Openmoko. We recommend Gnash. Gnash is a free software swf file player that supports up to swf version 8, with swf v9 currently under heavy development. It fully supports streaming video from popular web sites, and most flash based animations. On the Openmoko, Gnash has to use 100% software rendering, so some things, like streaming video over the internet has performance issues at this time.


A screenshot of Gnash on the NEO 1973 is here:
