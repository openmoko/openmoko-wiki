[[DashExpress]] is a device developed by a 3rdparty. For more information about phones developed by openmoko or are based on openmoko products, visit [[Phone Development]]. 

The Dash Express is based off of the legendary [[HXD8]]. The FCC ID is: EUNHXD8V2. It does have a debug port that is compatible with the Openmoko [[Debug Board v3]]. It is fairly hard to get to (for a FR). It sits underneath the screen.

It has 3GB of internal flash. The DFU map is below:

The serial interface is available only for u-boot. You can put it into DFU mode, and change the authorized_keys file to log into the unit.

I need to add more information to this page. I'm lazy. Hit me on irc: Sargun.
