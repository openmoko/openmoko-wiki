The '''Dash Express''' ('''HXD8''') is a networked collaborative automotive GPS unit from http://dash.net/ which was developped by Openmoko.

The FCC ID is: EUNHXD8V2. It does have a debug port that is compatible with the Openmoko [[Debug Board v3]]. It is fairly hard to get to (for a FR). It sits underneath the screen.

It has 3GB of internal flash. The DFU map is below:

The serial interface is available only for u-boot. You can put it into DFU mode, and change the authorized_keys file to log into the unit.

==Hardware==
From the information found in the [https://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/doc/hardware/HXD8v011/ hardware documentation] and [https://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/src/target/kernel/patches/ kernel patches] parts of the subversion repositories, the following specifications can be predicted. The HXD8v2 has shipped under the FCC ID [https://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/GenericSearchResult.cfm?RequestTimeout=500 EUNHXD8V2]

===Processor===
According to https://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/src/target/kernel/patches/s3c2440-nand-disable-hwecc.patch the HXD8 will feature an [http://www.samsung.com/Products/Semiconductor/common/product_list.aspx?family_cd=MSC0102 S3C2440], capable of running up to 400MHz. The features are the same as the [http://www.samsung.com/products/semiconductor/MobileSoC/ApplicationProcessor/ARM9Series/S3C2410/S3C2410.htm S3C2410] plus a camera interface.
*GPIO Assignments: https://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/doc/hardware/HXD8v011/gpio.txt

===Flash===
According to a currently available hardware patch, the device supports 1 NAND Flash device of up to 4G. (uncertain about what kind of G that is. Could be 4Gb (which makes about 0,5GB), could be 4GB).

The DE has 3G of Flash, and there is no NOR.

Some other patch implies that there is the possibility of connecting 3 NAND Flash chips.

===RAM===
128MB Random Access Memory, of which 2MB is used as a Framebuffer. https://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/src/target/u-boot/patches/uboot-hxd8.patch

===GSM/GPRS===
Using same GSM modem on GTA01 and GTA02, TI Calypso with 850/1800/1900 configuration.

=== SD-Card ===
The HXD8 features either an SD, miniSD or microSD-card slot.
* Connected to: S3C2410 MMC/SD controller
* Driver: https://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/src/target/kernel/patches/s3c_mci.patch

===LCD Module (LCM)===
The HXD8 features a 480x272 pixel LCD (which is a widescreen (16:9) ratio) with PWM-controlled backlight.



===Light Sensor===
The HXD8 features a light sensor by TAOS Inc. (Texas Advanced Optoelectronic Solutions). It's either a [http://www.taosinc.com/product_detail.asp?cateid=4&proid=59 TLS2560] or a [http://www.taosinc.com/product_detail.asp?cateid=4&proid=60 TLS2561]. This light sensor will be included to measure ambient illuminance to control the LCM backlight illumination, or for exposure control for the camera (depends on location of the chip).

===Power Management===
A Philips PCF50606 is used for power management.

===WiFi===
HXD8 features an SPI-connected Marvell 8686 based WiFi module.

===GPS===
The PMU chip's config contains a voltage group called GPS_3V3, and the [https://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/doc/hardware/HXD8v011/gpio.txt gpio.txt] a set of GPS UART data pins. HXD8 using SirfSTAR III based module solution
