==Overview==
SipDroid provides a SIP/VoIP-Client to your Freerunner with [[Android]] by adding
native SIP/VoIP support to Android's dialer and contacts. You are able to make and receive SIP/VoIP-calls over Wifi, 3G, and EDGE with good voice quality and low delay. SipDroid is capable to receive a Video-SIP/VoIP-Call on you freerunner. Of course sending Video is not possible because your Freerunner does not have a camera.

SipDroid lets you make phone calls over internet with your the internet connection of WiFi or your data flatrate, to save mobile phone costs and stay connected with one SIP-Account used at your home internet access and with your freerunner at the same time, e.g. with [http://www.sipgate.de SIPgate] you can register a SIP-Account that has real landline phone number. If you register this account in Sipdroid you can accept landline phone calls for your number in Germany with you Freerunner from anywhere in the world.
