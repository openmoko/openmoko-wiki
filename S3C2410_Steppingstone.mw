The S3C2410 Steppingstone is a special 4KBytes large buffer that allows S3C2410 to boot directly from NAND flash.  

Basically some hidden microcode in the S3C2410 takes care of copying the first 4KB of NAND flash into RAM, and re-mapping the first SDRAM page from 0x30000000 to 0x00000000.

The bootloader then needs to have some code to load the remaining bootloader code from NAND before executing itself.
