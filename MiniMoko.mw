The '''MiniMoko''' is about building an extension for the MiniBook from Always Innovating.

This device is ARM based, and gets everything a phone would, except GSM connectivity and some other stuff.
Always Innovating agreed with such a project and accepted to giv us a hand !

So this page will list all the documents we have and all the work to do.
