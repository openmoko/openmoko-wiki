The '''MiniMoko''' is about building an extension for the MiniBook from Always Innovating.

This device is ARM based, and gets everything a phone would, except GSM connectivity and some other stuff.
Always Innovating agreed with such a project and accepted to giv us a hand !

So this page will list all the documents we have and all the work to do.

== MiniMoko Concept ==

The main Idea of the MiniMoko, is to build a device, plugged through the 40pins connector (link to place here).
This device should be the same size of the MiniBook, so it's like adding a "slice".

In this device, we will put an USB hub, some 3G hardware, and let some plugs available. One should be on the side of the device (Mini USB)

The connector contains everything usefull to start something easilly : usb OTG. I/Os ...

== Features ==

List of features and corresponding  components.

* 3G (Voice + Data)  : '''Huawei E169''' (supports voice, small form factor) [http://3g-modem.wetpaint.com/page/Huawei+E169+%28E169G,+E169V,+K3520%29]
* GPS (aGPS ?)
* USB hub
* USB Charging+extra battery.
* Audio plug (Headset)

== ToDo ==

* Identifying hardware needed '''Work in progress'''
* Drawing a concept of the board (Basic schematics, then Logical schema )
* Drawing a concept of the box '''Perhaps no need, Have to see with A.I. already-done project'''
* Make the model board
