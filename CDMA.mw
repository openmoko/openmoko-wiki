=='''CDMA Version'''==

Currently there is no such version planned.<br>
The reason is simple:<br>
Openmoko is about free phones.<br>
We are currently not aware of any carrier using CDMA and supplying R-UIM (smardcards, similar to SIM cards in GSM networks).<br>
Every phone needs to be provisioned by the carrier itself.<br>
Most CDMA phones do not even have a R-UIM slot it seems.<br>
Thus a CDMA Version is currently not feasible.


==Interest==

This page is to suggest the possibility of a CDMA version of the OpenMoko and see if there would be any interest in accomplishing this:

#[[User:dyous87|dyous87]] -- CDMA support for carriers such as Verizon wireless is all I would need to get this phone. If this comes out I would get it without having to think twice.
#[[User:SteveoSupremo|SteveoSupremo]] -- I am willing and able to do hardware design. And if FIC wants it I will sign a NDA.
