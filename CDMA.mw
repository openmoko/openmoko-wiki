=='''CDMA Version'''==

Currently there is no such version planned.<br>
The reason is simple:<br>
Openmoko is about free phones.<br>
We are currently not aware of any carrier using CDMA and supplying R-UIM (smardcards, similar to SIM cards in GSM networks).<br>
Every phone needs to be provisioned by the carrier itself.<br>
Most CDMA phones do not even have a R-UIM slot it seems.<br>
Thus a CDMA Version is currently not feasible.


==Interest==

This page is to suggest the possibility of a CDMA version of the OpenMoko and see if there would be any interest in accomplishing this:

#[[User:dyous87|dyous87]] -- CDMA support for carriers such as Verizon wireless is all I would need to get this phone. If this comes out I would get it without having to think twice.
#[[User:SteveoSupremo|SteveoSupremo]] -- I am willing and able to do hardware design. And if FIC wants it I will sign a NDA.

# [[User:xphoenix|Andronov Philipp]] 27 October 2007 it would be greate to have CDMA smartphone
# [[User:brusstoc|brusstoc]] Nov 2007 - I am interested. (if this is an 'open' phone, then we should not eliminate carriers just because they are short-sighted, right?)
# [[User:artlex|artlex]] Nov 27th 2007 - Now that Verizon has decided to open up their CDMA network to all device makers in 2008 (for a 'small' fee), isn't this very desirable? In my area Verizon coverage is superior to all others. (http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20071127-verizon-opens-up-will-support-any-device-any-app-on-its-network.html)
