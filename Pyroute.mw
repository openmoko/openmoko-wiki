Cribbed from [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/openmoko-devel/2007-November/001734.html the mailing list], with some modifications that I had to make for it to work on my neo1973.

This is reconstructed from what [[User:Wurp|I]] remember & my notes of what worked for me.  Someone who tries this & sees modifications needed, please update!

On the neo:
'ipkg install python-pycairo python-pygtk python-netclient python-xml python-html python-netserver python-crypt python-threading'

I downloaded the packages from http://buildhost.automated.it/OM2007.2/packages/armv4t/.  The actual commands I issued were for the .ipk files I downloaded.

Download pyroute as per http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Pyroute#Download_and_installing  I actually used svn to get it on my main box, then used 'tar czf pyroute.tgz pyroute', 'scp pyroute.tgz 192.168.0.202:', and finally 'tar xzf pyroute.tgz' on the neo.

I had to hand edit /usr/lib/python2.5/urllib2.py and change 'import hashlib' to '#import hashlib'.  Some day we should figure out where to get _md5 and eliminate this step.

Then run 'python gui.py' in the directory you expanded pyroute into.

Unfortunately, it takes a very long time to come up the first time, and some buttons don't appear to work.  It does read gpsd and show you your location.
