For another project, I'm working with Stantum for a 3.5 multitouch screen.

I think this hardware is really interesting since :
  * it is supported under linux
  * there a high-level API to recognise movement
  * the technology is impressive (it's really accurate)
  * it's using a usb port
  * the price is not that high.

If someone that is involve in hardware could look more accurately on this multi-touch screen and if it could be use for any future hardware.

This entreprise is in Bordeaux (France), and I work there. I'm in contact with them. If you want me to ask them any question, I can.
