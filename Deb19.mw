== Installation ==
# Download filesystem:
#* Experimental, 2010-10-17: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7926454/openmoko/deb19/deb19_2010-10-17.tar.bz2 - 282MiB, 850MiB unpacked. '''This is really experimental version, don't rely on it''', but in my opinion it is usable. Feel free to test and comment it.
# Install [[Qi]] bootloader in NAND flash.
# Prepare SD card:
#* 1st partition: ext2 for system, at least 1GiB
#* 2nd partition: fat32 for user data such as music. Mounted on /mnt/userfiles. Non-obligatory, if you don't want to have this partition, comment out /dev/mmcblk0p2 in /etc/fstab.
# Untar filesystem archive to first partition.
# Unmount and/or eject SD card, then insert it into your FreeRunner.
# Boot by pressing POWER. Root password is <tt>changeme</tt>

== Changes comparing to original Debian ==
[[Image:Deb19 Sonata.png|thumb|Music playback with mpd - Sonata client]]
* Xorg uses glamo driver instead of fbdev,
* Configured Matchbox windows manager with finger-friendly theme,
* Installed: Woosh, Pidgin, mpd, Sonata, VLC, SMplayer and others,
* More finger-friendly matchbox-keyboard with Polish characters (ąćęłńóżź),
* Touch and hold the screen to simulate right click

== Known problems ==
* Profile selection in Zhone doesn't work,
* You can't switch to any window from desktop (workaround: select battery from openmoko-panel-plugin and do the switching from window that will appear),
* Matchbox-keyboard layout has no Tab button (You can restore original keyboard layout by removing or renaming <tt>/home/omuser/.matchbox/keyboard.xml</tt>),
* Bottom panel can crash after screen orientation change.
* Mokomaze doesn't work because of permissions problem. (workaround: run as root).

== In next release... ==
* Installed wicd and Sakura
* Screen rotation buttons (at top panel?)

== ToDo ==
* Replace Zhone with something better. '''Installing phoneui-apps can destabilize frameworkd, you have been warned!'''
* Better application launcher
* Better keyboard (write something new?)
* Install Paroli please
** Paroli? WTF? :O Paroli is deprecated. I'll try with phoneui-apps.
