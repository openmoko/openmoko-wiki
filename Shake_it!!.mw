'''Short description'''：

Dice are used in many different games. But, since must of us don't carry dice with us all the time, this project provides an electronic substitute for users so they can play games that require dice anytime, anywhere, with a Neo Freerunner.  Users roll the dice by shaking the Freerunner.  At the same time, users can hear the sound of rolling dice, giving an additional touch of reality to this application, when playing games.
