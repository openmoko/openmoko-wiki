==What's Next?==

There are no 2008.10 or 2008.11 releases. Openmoko set up an "Optimization team" led by John Lee to work on improving the distribution. The project last two months. No formal release was made in the end, even though the team considerably improved boot speed and fixed many bugs ([http://downloads.openmoko.org/daily/testing/ download directory]). The state of the tree at the end of the effort is summarized [http://lists.openmoko.org/nabble.html#nabble-f1954 here].

See [http://n2.nabble.com/No-more-optimization-team-tp1637861p1638039.html Openmoko's software roadmap] from December 2008 to mid 2009.
