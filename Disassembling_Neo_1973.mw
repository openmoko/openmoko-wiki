{{note| The [[Disassembling Neo1973 | Disassembling the Neo1973 page]] shows how to open up the GTA01Bv3 hardware revision.  Future hardware revisions may require updates to this page.}}

== Back side of Neo1973 ==

== Opening back cover ==

To remove the back cover, put your fingernail in the small recess on the top of the Neo, and pull gently.

{{note| You now need to remove the two Torx screws (T6x40)}}

== Carefully remove top cover ==
[[Image:Gta01b v3 case side opening white.jpg|700px]]

To remove the top cover, after removing the two Torx screws, ''carefully'' squeeze the end of the supplied guitar pick between the cover and the case at the bottom of the device, and then slide the pick up to the top on one side (do not twist the pick). As you slide the pick along, the case retaining clips should come apart with a snapping sound. Repeat the procedure for the other side of the device. To unclip the last remaining large retaining clip at the top, slide the pick all the way to the top (this can be difficult) and then press it in at the centre. By ''careful'' application of force the clip will detach and the cover can then be removed.

== Top case lid removed ==

Visible in this image, from the right, going clockwise.

*The blocky device at the far right is the GPS antenna.
**To the left of this, there are two gold pads, which are where the earpiece speaker connects.
*The [[Debug Board]] connector.
*At the left, the black semicircular device is the GSM antenna.
**Immediately to its right, the small circular black/gold object is the microphone
*At the top right, the ''Aux button''
*Right below it seems to be a small battery. It can also be seen on the picture below.

In the middle is the touchscreen LCD, the touchscreen printed wire can be seen beginning at the bottom left of this, through the glass.

== Lifting the PCB on the left side ==
{{note|You have to bend the plastic case a bit outwards until the headphone jack on the left side of the device becomes loose}}

== Removing PCB from case frame ==
{{note|Since the PCB now is loose on one side, you can carefully pull the USB socket and GPS antenna connector out of the right side of the case, and then flip the PCB upwards}}

This shows:
*At the top on a green board, the bluetooth module, and the square bluetooth antenna.
*The headset jack is to the right of this.
**Immediately below the headset jack is the [[Neo1973 Battery]] connector.
**Below the [[Neo1973 Battery]] connector, the two gold pads feed the vibrator motor.
*To the right of the headset jack is the left speaker connector.

On the other side of the PCB, going from bottom-right corner down-left.

*The small circular connector is the GSM connector to which an external aerial can be connected with the back removed, or with an alternative back.

*To the left of this is the right speaker connector.
*One of the button switches.
*USB port.
*Micro-SD slot
*SIM slot - overlaying the Micro-SD slot when present.
*Gold GPS antenna connector.
**Immediately above this with the grey wire connection is the connection to the built in GPS antenna. 

On the case picture below, you can see the left and right speakers under the translucent plastic, and the vibrator motor in the middle.

== Empty case frame ==

You can actually see the two stereo speakers beneath the translucent cover, and next to it the small vibrator motor.

Next to the top of the picture is a hole near the speaker.
The external GSM antenna connector is accessed through this hole.

== GSM Antenna ==
