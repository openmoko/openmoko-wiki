The [[I2C]] is a simple communication standard intended to move small amounts of data a few inches between chips. Please See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/i2c I2C Wikipedia page for additional information].

== I2C addresses ==

Note that I2C addresses are 7 bit. The last bit, which is not part of the address, indicates whether this is a read or write operation. So "0001 000x" is 0x8, not 0x10.

= Neo1973 =
On the Neo1973, we currently use the following addresses on the I2C bus:
{|
| '''Device''' || '''I2C address'''
|-
| [[PCF50606]] || 0001 000x
|-
| [[WM8753L]]  || 0011 010x
|-
| [[LM4857]]   || 1111 100x
|}

If you pop the top facia, I2C is available from two testpoints near the
debug connector.  GND is not on a testpoint there but the mounting holes at
the bottom and you can grab it from a capacitor under the battery on the
right of the picture too.
