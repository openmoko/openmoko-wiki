I2C is a simple communication standard intended to move small amounts of data a few inches between chips.
See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/i2c wikipedia].

We currently use the following addresses on the I2C bus:
{|
| '''Device''' || '''I2C address'''
|-
| [[PCF50606]] || 0001 000x
|-
| [[WM8753L]]  || 0011 010x
|-
| [[LM4857]]   || 1111 100x
|}

Note that I2C addresses are 7 bit. The last bit, which is not part of the address, indicates whether this is a read or write operation. So "0001 000x" is 0x8, not 0x10.
