'''Short description''':

This project takes the advantage of the Neo FreeRunner’s GPS sensor. It can transmit the GPS information to the other side. One side sends a “GPS info. Request” signal to the other side. After receiving this request, the other side can choose to response its GPS information or not. 
This mechanism can provide position information during emergency and preserve privacy if one chooses not to reveal his/her position.
