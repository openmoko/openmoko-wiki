== Introduction ==
Locations (code name Splinter) is a UI application within the Diversity project. 
Locations uses OpenStreetMap allowing users to browse maps and manage saved locations called ''Tags''.

== User Case ==
In addition to downloading map images from the OSM server, Locations also supports local maps, which can be downloaded through the [[Installer]].  You can also create your own maps if your city is not available.  For more information, refer to the [[http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Om2008.8_Locations#Create_Offline_Maps|Create Offline Maps]] section below. 

=== MAP === 
Use the '''MAP''' view to manage ''Tags'' with options to ''save'', ''edit'' or ''send''.  '''MAP''' view also allows users to browse maps with zoom in and zoom out for accurate locating.  If you get lost while browsing, simply tap the '''REFRESH''' button to return to your current position.  It's that easy.


=== LIST  ===
'''LIST''' view is a a centralized place to view all of your ''Tags''.  The '''LIST''' view is a combination of your own saved ''Tags'' and ''Tags'' received by friends.  
Selecting a ''Tag'' takes you to the exact position of the Tag in the '''MAP''' view.

== Architecture ==
Splinter is an UI application, communicating with diversity-daemon dbus interface to get all the data it needs.

What Splinter does and shows is based on and through diversity-daemon, like tag management and sharing, map downloading, gps status, etc.


== Design ==
Splinter used EFL library to implement the UI.
Sync with Diversity-daemon, Splinter has objects, world, viewport concept. There is a dbus wrapper layer for diversity daemon. 
In pure UI part, we have widgets like dialogs, menus, different objects like tags, map tilesets, etc.
 
In control part, we have a nav object for controlling the navigation, showing the tileset.

== Create Offline Maps ==
Splinter comes with a tool called '''splinter-map-pack'''. It can be used to pack tile images downloaded from OSM server into a map package:

<pre>
splinter-map-pack /tmp/diversity-maps my_map.eet
</pre>

Place '''my_map.eet''' in either of the directories

<pre>
/usr/share/splinter/maps
/media/card/splinter-maps
</pre>

and Splinter will find it automatically.
