== Introduction ==
'''Locations''' (codenamed ''Splinter'') is a location sharing application based on GPS and SMS.  It
uses [http://www.openstreetmap.org OpenStreetMap] as its map source and allows users to manage and share saved locations.

== Usage ==
In addition to downloading map images from the OSM server, '''Locations''' also supports local maps, which can be downloaded through the [[Installer]].  You can also create your own maps if your city is not available.  For more information, refer to the [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Om2008.8_Locations#Create_Offline_Maps Create Offline Maps] section below. 

=== Map === 
Use the '''MAP''' view to manage ''Tags'' with options to ''save'', ''edit'' or ''send''.  '''MAP''' view also allows users to browse maps with zoom in and zoom out for accurate locating.  If you get lost while browsing, simply tap the '''REFRESH''' button to return to your current position.  It's that easy.

=== List  ===
'''LIST''' view is a a centralized place to view all of your ''Tags''.  The '''LIST''' view is a combination of your own saved ''Tags'' and ''Tags'' received by friends.  
Selecting a ''Tag'' takes you to the exact position of the Tag in the '''MAP''' view.

=== Save & Send Tags ===
Once you are connected to GPS, saving and sending tags to friends is fun and simple.

* '''Save''' a Tag
# Press the '''touch me''' bubble that hovers above your current position.
# After the message box appears, tap directly into the text boxes under ''Edit Title'' and ''Edit Messages'' to add your ''Tag'' title or message.
# After entering your title or message, press '''SAVE''', at which point your newly created ''Tag'' will appear in bot '''MAP''' and '''LIST''' views.
# In the '''MAP''' view, tapping on the text of your ''Tag'' provides further options to ''edit'' or ''send'' your your ''Tag'' to a friend.

* '''Send''' a Tag
# In the '''MAP''' view, tap on the text of your ''Tag'', launching the '''edit * send''' bubble.
# Pressing on ''send'' will launch the ''Send a Tag'' message box
# Tap directly within the text boxes to edit your ''Tag'' before sending, or press ''Send'' and your ''Tag'' will be on its way.

== Architecture ==
'''Locations''' is a UI application, communicating with the diversity-daemon dbus interface to get all the data it needs.
What '''Locations''' does and shows is based on and through diversity-daemon, like tag management, sharing, map downloading and GPS status.

=== Design ===
'''Locations''' uses the [http://enlightenment.org/p.php?p=about&l=en EFL library] to implement UI.
Synced with diversity-daemon, '''Locations''' has objects, world and viewport concepts. There is a dbus wrapper layer for the diversity-daemon. 
In the UI, we have widgets like dialogs, menus, different objects like tags, map tilesets, etc.
 
In control part, we have a nav object for controlling the navigation, showing the tileset.

== Maps ==

=== Installation ===
Maps can be installed from [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Om2008.8_Installer Installer].

=== Create Your Own Maps ===

{{Note | Map packing eats lots of memory and fails easily on NEO.}} 

'''Locations''' comes with a tool called '''om-locations-map-pack'''. It can be used to pack tile images downloaded from the OSM server into a map package:

<pre>
om-locations-map-pack /tmp/diversity-maps my_map.eet
</pre>

Place '''my_map.eet''' in either of the directories

<pre>
/usr/share/om-locations/maps
/media/card/om-maps
</pre>

and '''Locations''' will find it automatically.

=== Share Maps ===
To share maps for other Neo users to install, see directions on how to * [[CommunityRepository#How_to_release_packages | Add a package to Openmoko Repository]]

=== Use SD Card for Tile Storage (git only) ===
By default, tiles downloaded from the OSM server are stored in '''/tmp/diversity-maps'''.  They disappear after rebooting.  This default path can be changed to, for example, use SD card by adding/editing one line
<pre>
tile_path = /media/card
</pre>

to '''~/.om-locations/config/om-locations.cfg'''.

=== Download Tiles of a Region (git only) ===
You can download tiles of a region by specifying '''-d''' option in '''om-locations-map-pack'''.  The usage is

<pre>
om-locations-map-pack -d version,source,min_level,max_level,lon,lat,width,height <tile-path>
</pre>

For example, to download tiles of Taipei and store them on the SD card, one can

<pre>
om-locations-map-pack -d 0,osm,5,16,121.5,25.0,0.1,0.1 /media/card
</pre>

Those important are the last four parameter, which gives the region to download.

== Turn on logging ==
For now, nmea logging is off by default. To get nmea log for being used, we can send dbus message after om-locations launched as below:
<pre>
dbus-send --session --dest=org.openmoko.Diversity --type=method_call --print-reply /org/openmoko/Diversity/objects/0/equipments/nmea org.openmoko.Diversity.Equipment.SetConfig string:log variant:string:/home/root/nmealog
</pre>
Then the log will be saved to /home/root/nmealog in this example. 

After om-locations terminated, logging will stop.

The size of log file will increase soon. For now be warned, if the dbus message was sent again, then the log will be overrridden. So backup or do some hacking first before doing that.
