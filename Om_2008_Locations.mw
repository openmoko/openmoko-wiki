== Introduction ==
Splinter is an UI application in Diversity project.
Splinter is a map-based application for user to browse map, see the fixed position, manage locations saved that also called tags. 
Splinter uses OSM(OpenStreetMap) map.

== User Case ==
Right now, Splinter has map view and tag list view.

In addition to downloading map images from OSM server as needed, Splinter supports local maps. Users can download map packages using Assassin, an installer tool, to download maps for some local cities.

In map view, 
the user can see his current fixed position, browse the map, including zoomin / zoomout, dragging the map and do tag management on map, like tag save, edit, delete, and share. 

In list view, the user can see all the tags and click a tag item to go back to map view with the tag shown centralized.


== Architecture ==
Splinter is an UI application, communicating with diversity-daemon dbus interface to get all the data it needs.

What Splinter does and shows is based on and through diversity-daemon, like tag management and sharing, map downloading, gps status, etc.


== Design ==
Splinter used EFL library to implement the UI.
Sync with Diversity-daemon, Splinter has objects, world, viewport concept. There is a dbus wrapper layer for diversity daemon. 
In pure UI part, we have widgets like dialogs, menus, different objects like tags, map tilesets, etc.
 
In control part, we have a nav object for controlling the navigation, showing the tileset.

== Create Offline Maps ==
Splinter comes with a tool called '''splinter-map-pack'''. It can be used to pack tile images downloaded from OSM server into a map package:

<pre>
splinter-map-pack /tmp/diversity-maps my_map.eet
</pre>

Place '''my_map.eet''' in either of the directories

<pre>
/usr/share/splinter/maps
/media/card/splinter-maps
</pre>

and Splinter will find it automatically.
