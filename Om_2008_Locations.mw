== Introduction ==
'''Locations''' (codenamed ''Splinter'') is a location sharing application based on GPS and SMS.  It
uses [http://www.openstreetmap.org OpenStreetMap] as its map source and allows users to manage and share saved locations.

== Usage ==
In addition to downloading map images from the OSM server, '''Locations''' also supports local maps, which can be downloaded through the [[Installer]].  You can also create your own maps if your city is not available.  For more information, refer to the [[#Create Your Own Maps]] section below. 

=== Map === 
Use the '''MAP''' view to manage ''Tags'' with options to ''save'', ''edit'' or ''send''.  '''MAP''' view also allows users to browse maps with zoom in and zoom out for accurate locating.  If you get lost while browsing, simply tap the '''REFRESH''' button to return to your current position.  It's that easy.

=== List  ===
'''LIST''' view is a a centralized place to view all of your ''Tags''.  The '''LIST''' view is a combination of your own saved ''Tags'' and ''Tags'' received by friends.  
Selecting a ''Tag'' takes you to the exact position of the Tag in the '''MAP''' view.

=== Save & Send Tags ===
Once you are connected to GPS, saving and sending tags to friends is fun and simple.

* '''Save''' a Tag
# Press the '''touch me''' bubble that hovers above your current position.
# After the message box appears, tap directly into the text boxes under ''Edit Title'' and ''Edit Messages'' to add your ''Tag'' title or message.
# After entering your title or message, press '''SAVE''', at which point your newly created ''Tag'' will appear in both '''MAP''' and '''LIST''' views.
# In the '''MAP''' view, tapping on the text of your ''Tag'' provides further options to ''edit'' or ''send'' your your ''Tag'' to a friend.

* '''Send''' a Tag
# In the '''MAP''' view, tap on the text of your ''Tag'', launching the '''edit * send''' bubble.
# Pressing on ''send'' will launch the ''Send a Tag'' message box
# Tap directly within the text boxes to edit your ''Tag'' before sending, or press ''Send'' and your ''Tag'' will be on its way.

== Maps ==

A map (.eet) is a collection of tiles.  You can install maps through [[Installer]] or create your own maps.  When looking for tiles to use, '''Locations''' will first try downloaded (cached) tiles.  If it fails, it will look for them in the available maps.  If it still fails, it will ask '''diversity-daemon''' to download, and cache them.  The following subsections provide instructions and tricks you can apply.

=== Installation ===
Maps can be installed from [[Installer]].

=== Create Your Own Maps ===

{{Note | Map packing eats lots of memory and fails easily on NEO.}}

'''Locations''' comes with a tool called '''om-locations-map-pack'''. It can be used to pack tile images downloaded from the OSM server into a map package:

<pre>
om-locations-map-pack /tmp/diversity-maps my_map.eet
</pre>

Place '''my_map.eet''' in either of the directories

<pre>
/usr/share/om-locations/maps
/media/card/om-maps
</pre>

and '''Locations''' will find it automatically.

=== Share Maps ===
To share maps for other Neo users to install, see directions on how to * [[CommunityRepository#How_to_release_packages | Add a package to Openmoko Repository]]

=== Use SD Card for Tile Storage (Om2008.9) ===
By default, tiles downloaded from the OSM server are stored in '''/tmp/diversity-maps'''.  They disappear after rebooting.  This default path can be changed to, for example, use SD card by adding/editing one line
<pre>
tile_path = /media/card
</pre>

to '''~/.om-locations/config/om-locations.cfg'''.

<pre>
config file may reside in ~/diversity-nav/config/diversity-nav.cfg
</pre>

=== Download Tiles of a Region (Om2008.9) ===
You can download tiles of a region by specifying '''-d''' option in '''om-locations-map-pack'''.  The usage is

<pre>
om-locations-map-pack -d version,source,min_level,max_level,lon,lat,width,height <tile-path>
</pre>

'''version''' can be any integer and '''source''' should be "osm".  For example, to download tiles of Taipei and store them on the SD card, one can

<pre>
om-locations-map-pack -d `date "+%Y%m%d"`,osm,5,16,121.5,25.0,0.1,0.1 /media/card
</pre>

In this example, a region of longitude between '''121.5''' to '''121.6''' and of latitude bwtween '''25.0''' to '''25.1''' is specified.  Tiles in this region and of levels from '''5''' to '''16''' are downloaded to '''/media/card'''.  By instructing '''Locations''' to use '''/media/card''' as its tile path, one could pre-download tiles of any region and have '''Locations''' use them.

== Turn on GPS Logging ==
For now, nmea logging is off by default. To get nmea log for being used, we can send dbus message after om-locations launched as below:
<pre>
dbus-send --session --dest=org.openmoko.Diversity --type=method_call --print-reply /org/openmoko/Diversity/objects/0/equipments/nmea org.openmoko.Diversity.Equipment.SetConfig string:log variant:string:/home/root/nmealog
</pre>
Then the log will be saved to /home/root/nmealog in this example. 

After om-locations terminated, logging will stop.

The size of log file will increase soon. For now be warned, if the dbus message was sent again, then the log will be overrridden. So backup or do some hacking first before doing that.

== Development ==
'''Locations''' is written in C and [http://enlightenment.org/p.php?p=about/efl EFL].  It talks to '''diversity-daemon''' through [http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus D-Bus] to, for example, send tags and download tiles.

To compile diversity-daemon,

<pre>
$ svn checkout svn://svn.projects.openmoko.org/svnroot/diversity/trunk/diversity-daemon
$ cd diversity-daemon
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure --enable-session-bus
$ make
$ sudo make install
</pre>

Please ensure that at least Control and OpenStreetMap backends are enabled.  If not, check that you have libdbus-glib-1-dev and libcurl4-gnutls-dev (on debian) or similar packages installed.

To compile Locations,

<pre>
$ git clone git://git.openmoko.org/git/om-locations.git
$ cd om-locations
$ ./autogen.sh
$ make
$ sudo make install
</pre>

Locations depends directly on recent versions of eet, evas, ecore, edje, and etk from EFL.  Please consult its website for instructions to build them.

=== Using Toolchain ===

{{Note | More tests needed on a clean machine.  At least, edje_cc is missing in this setup.}}

After the recent release of the [[Toolchain]], it is possible to cross-compile '''Locations''' by following some simple steps.

First, one need to get the [[Toolchain]],

<pre>
$ wget http://downloads.openmoko.org/toolchains/openmoko-i686-arm-linux-gnueabi-toolchain.tar.bz2    # for x86
$ wget http://downloads.openmoko.org/toolchains/openmoko-x86_64-arm-linux-gnueabi-toolchain.tar.bz2  # for x86_64
$ tar -C /tmp -jxf openmoko-i686-arm-linux-gnueabi-toolchain.tar.bz2
$ sudo mv /tmp/usr/local/openmoko /usr/local
</pre>

and install the dependencies,

<pre>
$ . /usr/local/openmoko/arm/environment-setup
$ opkg-target install libdbus-glib-1-dev curl-dev            # requirements for diversity-daemon
$ opkg-target install libetk-dev edbus-dev libts-dev         # requirements for om-locations
</pre>

You are ready to compile '''diversity-daemon''' and '''om-locations''' now.  To compile '''diversity-daemon''',

<pre>
$ . /usr/local/openmoko/arm/environment-setup
$ svn checkout svn://svn.projects.openmoko.org/svnroot/diversity/trunk/diversity-daemon
$ cd diversity-daemon
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure --host=arm-angstrom-linux-gnueabi --enable-session-bus
$ make
</pre>

The binary is available at src/diversity-daemon.  To compile '''om-locations''',

<pre>
$ . /usr/local/openmoko/arm/environment-setup
$ git clone git://git.openmoko.org/git/om-locations.git
$ cd om-locations
$ ./autogen.sh --host=arm-angstrom-linux-gnueabi
$ make
</pre>

The binary and theme could be found at src/om-locations and data/themes/default.edj.

== Feedbacks ==
'''Locations''' uses [https://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ Trac] for bug tracking.  When report bugs, please choose category Locations so that they go to the developers directly.  There is no mailing list specific for '''Locations'''.  Please use http://lists.openmoko.org/mailman/listinfo/ for discussion.

== Translations ==
'''Locations''' will be I18N-aware (support multi-languages) in the next release.  To have your language(s) in the supported list, one can take this [http://people.openmoko.org/olv/tmp/om-locations_0.2.pot POT file] and upload your translation to [https://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ Trac] by creating a new ticket.
