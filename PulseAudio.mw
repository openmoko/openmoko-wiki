'''PulseAudio''' ([http://www.pulseaudio.org/ homepage]) is the sound server used by OpenMoko to mix output from several applications as needed.

[[neod]] uses PulseAudio to play the samples "startup" and "touchscreen". 

The samples are loaded from files and can be changed or disabled at the configuration file /etc/pulse/session.
