'''PulseAudio''' ([http://www.pulseaudio.org/ homepage]) is the sound server used by Openmoko to mix output from several applications as needed.

[[neod]] uses PulseAudio to play the samples "startup" and "touchscreen". 

The samples are loaded from files and can be changed or disabled at the configuration file /etc/pulse/session.

== Turning the Neo1973 into a USB sound card ==

The sound server can easily be made available (and discoverable, thanks to [http://www.avahi.org Avahi]) in the local network, effectively turning the Neo1973 into an overqualified USB sound card (see also: http://www.pulseaudio.org/wiki/PerfectSetup):

 opkg install pulseaudio-module-zeroconf-publish pulseaudio-module-native-protocol-tcp
 echo "load-module module-native-protocol-tcp auth-ip-acl=127.0.0.1;192.168.0.0/16" >> /etc/pulse/session
 echo "load-module module-zeroconf-publish" >> /etc/pulse/session
 /etc/init.d/pulseaudio restart

Now on a Desktop with PulseAudio properly set up, the padevchooser applet lists the Neo's hostname as audio sink as soon as it is connected via USB.

== Pulseaudio takes 10% cpu time ==

Performance tip: Looking at the active processes with ''top'', if ''pulseaudio'' appears to take 10% cpu time even when doing nothing:

 opkg install pulseaudio-module-suspend-on-idle
 echo "load-module module-suspend-on-idle" >> /etc/pulse/session
 /etc/init.d/pulseaudio restart

: I think that pulseaudio was dropped from 2008.8 distribution, for performance reason. But installing openmoko-mediaplayer2 will pull it back from the repositories. [[User:MinhHaDuong|MinhHaDuong]] 13:08, 18 September 2008 (UTC)
