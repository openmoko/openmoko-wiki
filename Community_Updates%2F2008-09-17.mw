== Software and distributions ==
* Dale's [[NeoTool]] started. A GUI to manage the phones hostside. Backup and flash with GUI.
* [[FDOM - a Fat and Dirty OM based distribution]] started. A bleeding edge overloaded combination of applications and hot bugfixes to demonstrate the capabilities of the Freerunner and to have a functional phone. This all while retaining the ability to update through the official feeds.
* [[Gentoo]] on the FreeRunner.
* Several classic [[Games|games]] ported: Duke Nukem 3D, Battle for Wesnoth, DOOM (Coming Soon)
* [[Debian]] fso-pkg team is getting full steam ahead.

* Google SoC projects released: [[Gestures]] (includes autorotates the screen !), [[ReMoko]].

== Cool mods ==

== News from the  git ==
* The html access to buildhost.openmoko.org that provided 2007.2 has been discontinued and everything was moved to downloads.openmoko.org. The 2007.2 image is in [http://downloads.openmoko.org/releases/Om2007.11/ the folder named to Om2007.11]. The 2007.2 repository is at http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/Om2007.2/ .
* 2008.8 + daily updates is getting better and better, working its way towards a bug fix release (milestone tagged 2008.9 in the trac)
* Om shuffling git branches around is about done, .asu.dev is dead wood now.
* New "head" development branch is only basesystem+installer (no phone stack preloaded, even less applications)
* FSO Milestone 3 released
* Planned architecture for next release is  Tichy + Paroli + framework .

== Documentation team ==
* Redesigned wiki [[Main Page]] in time for the Digg day.
* Deleting [[Special:Log/delete| lots of old/unused]] wiki pages.
* Introduced wiki [[Templates#Navigation_boxes| navigation boxes]], working on [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Category:Categories categories].
* Learning to use our [[Special:Version| MediaWiki]] server. Postponed CSS revision. Wondering how to improve multilinguism support.
* More blogs added to [http://planet.openmoko.org/ the planet].

== Notable fixes ==
* GPS TTFF bug was fixed soon after launch. The software fix solves the problem as well as the hardware fix, so there is no necessity to hardware fix the units in the field.
* Keyboard choices in 2008.8 [[Keyboard Debate| explained]].
* Workaround found for suspend corrupts SD card partition table (??? Slow the GLAmo clock ???)
* Echo cancelation turned on in TI chip (is that undocumented function in 2008.8 updates yet ?)

== Hot bugs and most discussed issues ==
* Touch Screen Coordinates not re-calculating correctly on screen Rotation (Every mode except randr -o 0) Patch is available, no package update.
* Using Bluetooth headset is solved [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Manually_using_Bluetooth#Bluetooth_Headset_on_Freerunner Headset on Freerunner] but still a work in progress
* Sound is still awfully complicated (alsa.state remains black magic)
* Power management: progress but still far from goal of autonomy in days (full discharge vs. forced load issue, LEDs and buttons use model still in flux, charging while off, fine-grained subsystems sleep...)
* Repeated messages on the mailing lists
* The trac is getting crowded, bug reports numbers are exploding

== People ==
* community-repository is slow to take off: orrery, diversity-wifi, mofi, moko-sudoku, comic-reader, only omview has been added in September.
