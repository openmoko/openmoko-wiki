Everybody loves Community Updates, but that's a huge endeavour for one person to tackle. So let us try a little social experiment here: ''community written community update''. I posted an outlined list of bullet points, and left it to everybody else to elaborate along the following editorial guidelines:
* Include everything that was hot on a mailing lists at some point since launch.
* Limit each point to three sentences and one link.

== Software and distributions ==
* Dale's DFU script started
* FDOM started
* Gentoo started
* Several classic games ported: Duke Nukem 3D, Battle for Wesnoth, DOOM (Coming Soon)
* Debian fso-pkg team is getting full steam ahead
* Qtopia 4.3.2 released
* Google SoC projects released: gestures (includes autorotates the screen !), ReMoKo

== Cool mod ==

* [[Openmokast]]

== News from the  git ==
* The html access to downloads.openmoko.org that provided 2007.2 has been discontinued.
* 2008.8 + daily updates is getting better and better, working its way towards a bug fix release (milestone tagged 2008.9 in the trac)
* Om shuffling git branches around is about done, .asu.dev is dead wood now.
* New "head" development branch is only basesystem+installer (no phone stack preloaded, even less applications)
* FSO Milestone 3 released
* Planned architecture for next release is  Tichy + Paroli + framework .

== Documentation team ==
* Redesigned wiki Main page in time for the Digg day
* Deleting lots of old/unused wiki pages
* Introduced wiki navigation boxes, working on categories
* Learning to use Widimedia. Postponed CSS revision, wondering how to deal with multilinguism better
* More blog added to the planet

== Notable fixes ==
* GPS TTFF bug was fixed soon after launch (what happens to the first batch units then, is there a way / necessity to do the hardware fix ?)
* Keyboard choices in 2008.2 explained
* Workaround found for suspend corrupts SD card partition table (??? Slow the GLAmo clock ???)
* Echo cancelation turned on in TI chip (is that undocumented function in ?)

== Hot bugs ==
* Touch Screen Coordinates not re-calculating correctly on screen Rotation (Every mode except randr -o 0) Patch is available, no package update.
* Using Bluetooth headset is still impossible/hard to do
* Sound is still awfully complicated (alsa.state remains black magic)
* Power management: progress but still far from goal of autonomy in days (full discharge vs. forced load issue, LEDs and buttons use model still in flux, charging while off, fine-grained subsystems sleep...)
* Repeated messages on the mailing lists
* The trac is getting crowded, bug reports numbers are exploding

== Classifieds ==
* community-repository is slow to take off: orrery, diversity-wifi, mofi, moko-sudoku, comic-reader, only omview has been added in September.
* A classified section has been started to sell/buy on the wiki
* There was a job offer for an X dev
* The Paris meeting was a big success with ~80 attendees.
* FreeRunners still seem to sell like hotcakes, they are frequently out of stock.
