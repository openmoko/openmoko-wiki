= Installing pre-built image =

== Installing to [[NAND-flash]] ==

As usual, you need rootfs and kernel (assuming you're using [[Qi]] or [[U-Boot]]) which are available at :
http://nanl.de/files/openwrt/openmoko/

 wget http://nanl.de/files/openwrt/openmoko/LATEST_openwrt-s3c24xx-2.6-root.jffs2-128k
 wget http://nanl.de/files/openwrt/openmoko/LATEST_openwrt-s3c24xx-2.6-uImage

 #normal flashing
 sudo dfu-util -a rootfs -R -D LATEST_openwrt-s3c24xx-2.6-root.jffs2-128k
 sudo dfu-util -a kernel -R -D LATEST_openwrt-s3c24xx-2.6-uImage

 # Neofreerunner flashing in case of dfu-util is confused with more than one USB device:
 #
 sudo dfu-util -d [[USB Product IDs|0x1d50:0x5119]] -a rootfs -R -D LATEST_openwrt-s3c24xx-2.6-root.jffs2-128k
 sudo dfu-util -d [[USB Product IDs|0x1d50:0x5119]] -a kernel -R -D LATEST_openwrt-s3c24xx-2.6-uImage
 #
 # The IDs (0x1d50:0x5119) was found by using the command #dfu-util --listdfu-util
 # and looking for name="USB Device Firmware Upgrade".

Then boot from flash.

== Installing to SD card via PC and Freerunner ==
{{note|Not succesful yet (20090728_r16973, [[U-Boot]]), but files seems ok.}}

For booting from SD card fetch this rootfs and the kernel image (same than above mentioned):
 wget http://nanl.de/files/openwrt/openmoko/LATEST_openwrt-s3c24xx-rootfs.tgz
 wget http://nanl.de/files/openwrt/openmoko/LATEST_openwrt-s3c24xx-2.6-uImage

[[Booting_from_SD#Prepare_the_SD_card|Prepare your SD, SDHC card for kernel and rootfs partitions]].

Assuming 8MB kernel partition mounted as /mnt/mokokernel and /path is where the file is stored on your PC. Run command from PC:

 scp /path/LATEST_openwrt-s3c24xx-2.6-uImage root@192.168.0.202:/mnt/mokokernel/uImage-GTA02.bin

Assuming rootfs partition mounted as /media/card :

 cat /path/LATEST_openwrt-s3c24xx-rootfs.tgz |ssh root@192.168.0.202 "gunzip -d | tar -C /media/card/ -xf -"

== Installing to SD card via PC ==
{{note|This part assume you use [[Qi]] as bootloader. [[U-Boot]] will not work using this setup  }}
For booting from SD card fetch this rootfs and the kernel image (same than above mentioned):
 wget http://nanl.de/files/openwrt/openmoko/LATEST_openwrt-s3c24xx-rootfs.tgz
 wget http://nanl.de/files/openwrt/openmoko/LATEST_openwrt-s3c24xx-2.6-uImage

Following instructions assume that you are using a SD card reader on host PC.
* Format SD card using ext2 or ext3.
 mkfs.ext2 /dev/sdf1
* Mount this partion 
 mount /dev/sdf1 /mnt/disk
* Unpack rootfs archive to card.
 tar xvzf LATEST_openwrt-s3c24xx-rootfs.tgz -C /mnt/disk
* Copy kernel to card /boot/uImage-GTA02.bin
 cp LATEST_openwrt-s3c24xx-2.6-uImage /mnt/disk/boot/uImage-GTA02.bin
* Umount SD card partition
 umount /mnt/disk
* Then boot from SD card with your FreeRunner.

= Usage =
After flashing both images, reboot your phone and depending on what packages were built into the image (if compiled yourself this means the packages you've selected) you might be able to initiate and receive phonecalls with your FreeRunner running OpenWrt :)

'''First start'''

You see nice OpenWrt bootsplash and message "split_squashfs: no squashfs found in neo1973-nand", but just wait minute or two and X will start. Enlightenment+illume starts. There are xterm installed and qwerty-button for [[on-screen-keyboard]].

You can reach the Freerunner over wlan or [[USB_Networking|usb network]] as usual but Freerunner under OpenWrt have '''192.168.1.1 IP address''' as default.

'''Enable wifi'''
 echo s3c2440-sdi > /sys/bus/platform/drivers/s3c2440-sdi/unbind
 echo s3c2440-sdi > /sys/bus/platform/drivers/s3c2440-sdi/bind
 
 ifconfig eth0 up
 iwconfig eth0 essid NAME
 udhcpc

If your router has ip 192.168.1.1 (which is recommend in usb-networking), use this to stop usb0:
 ifconfig br-lan down
Or you can change the address of usb0. Is it in file: ''/etc/config/network''

'''Enable SSH'''

To be able to SSH your phone, you must setup a password. You can use xterm and command 'passwd' or you can use telnet (if you connects over wlan, use proper ip-address):

 $ telnet 192.168.1.1
 Trying 192.168.1.1...
 Connected to 192.168.1.1.
 Escape character is '^]'.
  === IMPORTANT ============================
   Use 'passwd' to set your login password
   this will disable telnet and enable SSH

== Installing packages ==
It uses opkg and default repository is http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/s3c24xx/packages/

 opkg update
 opkg install nano

= Build custom image =
== Fetching OpenWrt trunk ==
First you have to create a svn checkout of the OpenWrt base system

 svn co svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk openwrt

The command will fetch the OpenWrt base system and put it into the openwrt subfolder of your current working directory. From now on this HOWTO assumes that your working direcory will be the newly created openwrt folder. 

 cd openwrt

== Add packages from extra feeds ==
Although this is sufficient enough to build an image for the freerunner you will not be able to build a lot of packages useful on your phone. Those packages are in extra feeds. To enable those feeds:

 cp feeds.conf.default feeds.conf

Then edit your feeds.conf and enable the efl (for enlightenment) and phone (for fso, paroli, ...) feeds, by removing the '#' at the beginning of these lines, so that it might look like:

 src-svn packages svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/packages
 src-svn xwrt http://x-wrt.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/package
 src-svn luci http://svn.luci.subsignal.org/luci/branches/luci-0.8/contrib/package
 src-svn phone svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/feeds/phone
 src-svn efl svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/feeds/efl
 src-svn desktop svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/feeds/desktop
 #src-svn xfce svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/feeds/xfce

Please mind that this config does not define what packages will be compiled - it just defines which package-descriptions (OpenWrt-Makefiles) will be fetched which will be listed within the menuconfig later.

After that update your feeds to download the OpenWrt-Makefiles of these packages and provide (install) them

 scripts/feeds update -a
 scripts/feeds install -a

== Configure target and packages ==
Now you'll have to select the target platform for the freerunner. Run

 make menuconfig

and select s3c24xx as the Target System. As Target Profile you have to choice between 
* '''Openmoko GTA-02 (full)''': This is the one you probably want since it has enlightenment and paroli preselected.
* '''Openmoko GTA-02 (minimal)''': This profile contains only the basic OpenWrt packages, so you'll only get a shell and some command-line utils.

You now can also select additional packages you want to be installed in your image. Make sure you select as build in [*] else [M] you'll only get the packages but they will not be in the image, but can be installed later on.

You maybe also want to change the IP address under which the freerunner will be reachable. To do so select "[*] Image configuration". In its submenu you can change the images network configuration.

Per default OpenWrt is using the uclibc as libc implementation. You can use another libc (e.g. the glibc) by changing that via "[*] Advanced configuration options (for developers)" -> "---   Toolchain Options" -> "LIBC implementation".

== Build your OpenWrt image ==
If your done configuring the image you can build it by just running:

 make

'''Warning:''' OpenWrt build system have more or less requirements depends on selected packages. Using GTA-02 full profile, we need: 
* ''subversion'' and git to retrieve some external sources. (On Debian Lenny: ''subversion git-core'')
* full ''autotools'' suite. (On Debian Lenny: ''automake autoconf autotools-dev libtool pkg-config'')
* ''dbus-binding-tool'' to be able to compile "gsm0710muxd". (On Debian Lenny: ''libdbus-glib-1-dev'')
* ''autopoint'' and ''cvs'' is used by enlightenment building process. (On Debian Lenny: ''gettext cvs'')

This will now take some time. Please make sure you have enough free space left (~4 GB for full-profile).
Instead you can use "make V=99" to get debug output to see what's going on / went wrong.

== Flash Neo FreeRunner ==
When the build process is finished you will find a rootfs (openwrt-s3c24xx-2.6-root.jffs2-128k) and a kernel image (openwrt-s3c24xx-2.6-uImage) in the bin/ subfolder of your OpenWrt installation, which can be installed on your freerunner with the [[Dfu-util|dfu util]] as normal. Then you can continue as usage section says (beware if you have disable something).
