== Howto create an OpenWRT image for the freerunner ==

First you have to create a svn checkout of the OpenWRT base system

 svn co https://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk openwrt

The command will fetch the OpenWRT base system and put it into the openwrt subfolder of your current working directory. From now on this HOWTO assumes that your working direcory will be the newly created openwrt folder. (`cd openwrt`)

Although this is sufficient enough to build an image for the freerunner you will not be able to build a lot of packages useful on your phone. Those packages are in extra feeds. To enable those feeds 

 cp feeds.conf.default feeds.conf

And then edit your feeds.conf and enable the efl (for enlightenment) and phone(for fso, paroli, ...) feeds. (Remove the # in front of it)

After that update your feeds to download the packages and then install them

 scripts/feeds update
 scripts/feeds install -a

Now you'll have to select the target platform for the freerunner. Run

 make menuconfig

and select s3c24xx as the Target System. As Target Profile you have to choice between 
* gta02-full. This is the one you probalby want since it has enlightenment and paroli preselected.
* gta2-mini. This profile contains only the basic OpenWRT packages, so you'll only get a shell and some commandline utils.

You now can also select some additional packages you want to be installed in your image. Make sure you select as build in [*] else [M] you'll only get the packages but they will not be in the image, but can be installed later on.

You maybe also want to change the IP address under which the freerunner will be reachable. To do so select "[*] Image configuration". In its submenu you can change the images network configuration.

If your done configuring the image you can build it by just running

 make

This will now take some time.

When the build process is finished you will find a rootfs (openwrt-s3c24xx-2.6-root.jffs2-128k) and a kernel image (openwrt-s3c24xx-2.6-uImage) in the bin subfolder of your openwrt installation, which can be installed on your freerunner with the [[Dfu-util|dfu util]].

Now you can boot your phone and depending on what packages you've selected you'll might be able to make some phone calls.

You can also reach the freerunner over [[USB_Networking|usb network]] via telnet. SSH is also available after you have set up password for the root account (Run `passwd` in a telnet session).
