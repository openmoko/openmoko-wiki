About 8 hours with heavy use (The 1st days with my phone...) - which was to be expected since the device was virtually never in suspend mode (see the Suspend section.)

==Software Keyboard==
# Keyboard type - Multi-tap
# Displays correctly - Yes
# Usability - Poor: Multi-tap input's lack of CTRL keys harms terminal use. But at least predictive. It is easy to install a better keyboard, though using opkg.

==Suspend==
# Suspend / Resume works: Many times fails to suspend; Sometimes won't resume again. 
# All features work after suspend / resume cycle: If the phone does come up again, Yes
# Can receive incoming calls or sms while in suspend: Yes
