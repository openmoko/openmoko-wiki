== To change a running system ==

=== Start erlang as a node ===
This is my /etc/X11/Xsession.d/80zhone. As you can see the erlang node's got a name "-name neo@192.168.0.202" (a running erlang virtual machine is called an erlang node). And it's got a cookie "-setcookie SFEWRG34AFDSGAFG35235".

<pre>
#!/bin/sh -e
#zhone > /tmp/zhone.log 2>&1 &
/home/root/cean/start.sh -setcookie SFEWRG34AFDSGAFG35235 -name neo@192.168.0.202 -noshell -pa /home/root/trunk -s main start > debug.txt
renice -3 $!
exit 0
</pre>


Every erlang node in your network should have a unique name, and a common cookie. Start an erlang node on your host PC with a unique name and the common cookie:
<pre>
erl -setcookie SFEWRG34AFDSGAFG35235 -name 'host@192.168.0.200'
</pre>

From your host erlang console try
<pre>
net_adm:ping('neo@192.168.0.202'). 
</pre>
The response should be 'pong' if you have a successful connection - if not, the response is 'pang'

Then try the shell command
<pre>
nodes().
</pre>
The response should be a list of all known nodes in your network.

=== Load the code ===
To carry out Hot Code Loading you start a an erlang node on your host (remember to set a different name and to use the same cookie) and from the host erlang shell type nl(your_modulename). Substitute your_modulename with the name of the module you want to load into the virtual machine.
