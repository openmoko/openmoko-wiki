We have set up a SCM repository for experimental code and documentation at http://projects.linuxtogo.org/projects/sphyrna.

Christian did some stracing on TomTom device, and result is great logs at http://www.maintech.de/download/hammerhead-strace.log . 'pH5' on IRC has put up some traces at http://linuxtogo.org/~ph5/tmp/gllin (a cold start, a hot start and a somewhat longer trace). He even has a software that can init and send command to phase-1 openmoko device in http://linuxtogo.org/~ph5/tmp/hhtest.c . (Please use strace -s9999 -x to produce traces).

A file giving doppler information on the above longtrace NMEA is on [http://www.mauve.plus.com/gps].

[[User:mmontour]] has created a quick and dirty gtk program called 'satscan' which performs the first steps of a cold-start acquisition. It scans through the satellite numbers 8 at a time in several different frequency bands, and displays a symbol on the screen indicating the strength of each signal. The program (which includes portions of 'hhtest.c') is available here: [http://members.shaw.ca/mmontour/satscan/satscan_1.0-r0_armv4t.ipk]. 

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_signals GPS signals at wikipedia] seems to be required reading for very basics, along with  [http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/gps/gps.html this page from University of Colorado] for more in depth stuff.

http://home.earthlink.net/~cwkelley/ has sources for open-source GPS receiver, and 
http://home.earthlink.net/~cwkelley/documentation.htm is its documentation.

https://okeefesrv.geomatics.ucalgary.ca/essentials/index.html provides a library of useful GPS-related algorithms under a 3-clause BSD license. 

GP2021 is "dumb" GPS receiver, similar to hammerhead. (But I think it communicates over ISA bus, not over serial). However, its data sheets are freely available. Well, hammerhead marketing tells us that their GPS chip is something special, http://www.gpsworld.com/gpsworld/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=3053 . It seems to differ from "dumb" receivers by doing code phase search in hardware, directly.

There is an interesting paper on increasing accuracy of commercial GPSs that may be applicable. [http://www.ion.org/search/view_abstract.cfm?jp=j&idno=2439].
Other interesting papers. [http://gauss.gge.unb.ca/papers.pdf/iongpsgnss2003.beran.pdf] [http://topo.epfl.ch/documents/EuroSDR/beran05.pdf]
