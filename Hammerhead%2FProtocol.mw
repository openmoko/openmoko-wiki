Christian did some stracing on TomTom device, and result is great logs at http://www.maintech.de/download/hammerhead-strace.log .

GPS seems to communicate in packets.

Direction GPS -> machine

read(3, "\xfe\x00\xfd\x80\x16\x19\x0b\x00\x00\xfc", 2048) = 10

\xfe: begining of packet
\x00: type of packet? seems to determine length.
\xfd: follows
....
\xfc: packet end

GPS signals at wikipedia seems to be required reading: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_signals

=== Analysis ===

Were there by any chance 8 satellites overhead at the time that log was made?

The protocol appears to be oriented around 32-bit words (the single-byte markers notwithstanding.)  I'm not absolutely certain, but I strongly suspect the byte order is LSB-first.

The 80 80 80 stuff is probably just to force resynchronizing after an error, or wake the device up, or something like that.

It is - we have this information from another source. It's to train the UART in the hammerhead to the correct speed. --[[User:Speedevil|Speedevil]] 11:39, 28 April 2007 (CEST)

Packet format (same format in both directions):
* The start of a packet is marked by FF or FE.
** FF in packets that do not carry data, but rather explicitly request a response.  (This isn't used very often.  More often we receive data without explicitly requesting it.)  The response will be an FE-packet with the same length and type as the FF-packet.  The GPS does not send any FF packets, only gltt does.
** FE in packets that carry data sections.
* The first word (32 bits) following the start-of-packet marker is the header.
** The first byte (if it's indeed little-endian, the least significant byte) gives the data length, measured as ''the number of data words minus 1.''  For FE-packets, this is the length of the data section of this packet.  For FF-packets, it's the length of the data section in the expected response.
** The second byte of the header is always FD.
** MS nibble of the third byte might be flags for the packet.
** LS nibble of the third byte might be an identifying number which is echoed in responses to this packet.
** The fourth byte is the packet type.
* In FE-packets only, the data section (''n'' 32-bit words) follows.
* Finally, FC is sent to mark the end of the packet.
* After the FC in an FF-packet, gltt sends a bunch of zeroes.  In some cases it sends a number of zeroes equal to the number of bytes in the response packet; in some cases it sends more.  I would guess that these have no effect.

For example:
 ff 04fdc00c fc
(possibly followed by zeroes), is a request for a packet of type 0C, with length 20d ((4 + 1) * 4), and flags C0.

 fe 04fdc00c 0025102a 45dbdd4e 36030000 4b260000 16010000 fc
would be an appropriate response.

=== NMEA ===

It is possible to translate NMEA messages into something readable using script like this:

#!/bin/bash
grep -v gettimeofday | \
	sed 's/read.3/read(GPS/' | \
	sed 's/write.3/write(GPS/' | \
	sed 's/write.5/write(NMEA/' | \
	sed 's/\\/\\\\/g' | \
	while read LINE; do
		if echo $LINE | grep write.NMEA; then
			echo -e $LINE
		else
			echo "$LINE"
		fi
	done


NMEA description is available at http://www.gpsinformation.org/dale/nmea.htm .

At this point:

...6 satelitte GPS fix was obtained. (And yes, there's big read few lines before that in the log). As far as I can tell, only 5-6 sattelite were _used_ till the end of log.

GSA sentence looks interesting, too. It tells us satellites #02, #04, #08, #10, #13 and #27 were used at this point.
