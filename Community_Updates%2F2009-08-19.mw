==Distributions==
{{DistributionBox|
Name=Qalee|
Description=Qalee is a phone environment developed in Qt4 above the fso stack. It works on the freerunner under any distribution that supports Qt4. It's not finished yet but you can test a preview version with the official Qalee distributon. This release includes no new features, but many fixes for things that didn’t work or were incomplete in 0.0.2. You can read full [http://think-free.homelinux.org/wordpress/ announcement], or take a look at some of changes:
* Qalee is now based on shr instead of debian.
* clock widget now shows a calendar when clicked.
* status panel widget shows gsm network name and power and internet connection status while on wifi or gprs.
* screen menu : you can now choose the background picture with a cover-flow effect, letting the backlight always on now works.
* network menu : all entries work, gsm one is a little buggy though.
* Wifi works despite the the bug in the kernel 2.6.29 opened for 4 month.
* application menu : to launch application just click on it :) when launched the button becomes green, to close it, press the close button which becomes red and click on the application you want to close
* power button supports suspend on short press, or menu on longer press.
* phone application is now litephone modified to use Qalee’s buttons.
* GorshPlayer is broken, if you have Qt4.5.2 librairies with phonon working on shr, tell me (?)//FIXME
* keyboard is still literky.
* Themable interface allows you to change some colours of the interface.
<br>WARNING :<br>
Qalee is in pre-alpha stage, a lot of thinks are not coded yet, other are broken, some may be changed. It's just a preview version of the current work!|
