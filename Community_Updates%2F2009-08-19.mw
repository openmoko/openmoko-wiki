As such, this is the last official OpenmokoFramework status report - future reports will appear elsewhere. The DBus APIs have received little updates and are pretty much considered stable for FSO-1. They thanks to all contributors, especially the testers and the people who build stuff on top of the freesmartphone.org APIs.
