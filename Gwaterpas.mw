== Overview ==
I (Kurt Van Dijck) wrote this application to use Openmoko as a 1D or 2D levelling tool.

== Features ==
* You can select which of the 2 accelerometers to use (or use them both, but I'm not aware how exactly they are positioned)
* easy calibration: The program remembers 6 calibration values: 3 axis on 2 sensors.
* Any 3 axis for 1D levelling
* Any of 3 combined axis for 2D levelling

=== version 0.3 ===
* proper rotate/resize in 2D mode.
* icon provided on discussion page here
