這篇文章介紹如何將網路攝影機(Webcam)應用到[[Neo_FreeRunner|Freerunner]]上. 

網路攝影機這裡使用的是Logitech出版的[http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/webcam_communications/webcams/devices/4224&cl=tw,zh 快看S5500網路攝影機], 使用[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_video_device_class UVC]]驅動程式.

The method described here is still rather ugly, feel free to improve it.

== Make it work on a PC ==

To be safe, you just first ensure the webcam works on a regular PC, and Linux in particular. This will minimise the problems you are likely to face (though it may not eliminate them altogether). The regular documentation applies:

* to [http://linux-uvc.berlios.de/ UVC-compliant webcams]

== Add video support to the kernel ==

The 2.6.24 kernel is provided without video input support enabled. There is a way to add the necessary modules without recompiling everything:

* download the source code for the kernel:
# wget http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.24.tar.bz2
* make sure you have bzip2 and development tools installed:
# apt-get install bzip2 gcc make libc6-dev libncurses5-dev
