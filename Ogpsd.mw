'''ogpsd''' is a program that makes the GPS data available to applications through a DBUS interface. It is part of the [[OpenmokoFramework]] used in the FSO and the Debian distribution. Former distributions 2007.2 and ASU 2008.8 and 2008.9 used another daemon named ''gpsd''. These two are not compatible, having both running at the same time is bad. On the distributions that use ''ogpsd'', legacy applications that have not been ported to use the DBUS interface need a backward compatibility shim. This compatibility program is called ''fso-gpsd'', and must be run alongside (not instead of) ''ogpsd''.
