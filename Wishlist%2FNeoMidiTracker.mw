{{Wishlist}}

A wish for a developer to create a simple, multitrack, midi sequencer for use on the Neo1973. 

====Desired Features====
# A piano roll for each track, as opposed to octave/note, allowing for polyphony.<br>Each track should be able assignable to any midi channel 1-16.
# The ability to export as standard midi extensions.
# The ability to transmit midi, in realtime, via the USB port.
