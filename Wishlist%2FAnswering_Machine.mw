A flexible answering machine, that can record incoming calls.

For example, a caller on your 'answerphone' list, when you have your phone in silent mode, may drop straight to answerphone, where the phone plays a message down the phone, then takes a callers message.

Related functionality could be to screen phone spam. See [[Wishlist:Human_screening]].
