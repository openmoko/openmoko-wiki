A flexible answering machine, that can record incoming calls.

For example, a caller on your 'answerphone' list, when you have your phone in silent mode, may drop straight to answerphone, where the phone plays a message down the phone, then takes a callers message.

Related functionality could be to screen phone spam. See [[Wishlist:Human_screening]].

==Constraints==

The audio chip in the Neo1973 only has 2 A/D and 3 D/A.

This means that the phone cannot play (stereo?) mp3 while answering the phone for you.

==Away feature ==
A mode like silent mode, where you record a short voice message that will be played for people calling. 
E.g. "I'm not answering the phone because I'm in the cinema."
