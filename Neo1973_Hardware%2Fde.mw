==== CALYPSO digital Basisband ====
Unfortunately we cannot provide many details on the GSM chipset due to very tight NDAs.  However, this is not neccessarily required, since it interfaces using a standard UART serial line with the S3C2410.  On that interface, [http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/07_series/07.05/ GSM 07.05], [http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/07_series/07.10/ GSM 07.10] and other standardized protocols are used.

-- [[User:Xkr47|xkr47]]: Could we at least know the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gprs#The_GPRS_capability_classes GPRS capabilitiy class and the GPRS multislot class] ?

== History ==
=== GTA01 ===
This is the most simple, non-bluetooth version of the prototype.

==== GTA01v3 ====
First generation of prototypes that was given to internal OpenMoko software developers.

Unfortunately not useful at all due to non-working touchscreen.

* ATAG_REVISION: 0x0000130

==== GTA01v4 ====
Second generation of prototypes that was given to Harald + Mickey.

Unfortunately still not useful due to half-working touchscreen.

* ATAG_REVISION: 0x00000140

=== GTA01B ===
This is the bluetooth-enabled fork of GTA01

==== GTA01Bv2 ====
This is the first produced version of the bluetooth-enabled version.

* ATAG_REVISION: 0x00000220

==== GTA01Bv3 ====
This is the second produced version of the bluetooth-enabled version. It contains mainly GPS-related fixes.

* ATAG_REVISION: 0x00000230

This is the version that is shipped in Phase 0

===== GTA01Bv3 Errata =====
====== PMU unable to resume from suspend ======
Due to use of wrong GPIO/EINT pin, the PMU cannot wake-up the phone after suspend.  This means, specifically, '''the following events can not bring the phone back from suspend-to-ram''':
* PMU RTC Alarm
* Power button press
* Charger events (charger insertion/removal/error)
* Low battery

====== Stand-by time extremely low ======
This is due to a design bug resulting in at least 30mA additional standby current, since we cannot properly switch off the power supply to the S3C2410 PLL's.  There is nothing we can do to change this with post-production fixes.  GTA01Bv4 will address this issue.

====== GSM doesn't resume phone from suspend ======
The GSM modem currently doesn't signalize a wakeup interrupt to the S3C2410 in case there's some noteworthy event, such as incoming call, loss of network, incoming SMS or the like.

This is a serious issue, but can be fixed with a GSM Modem Firmware update.

====== GSM Sidetone too loud ======
The local feedback sidetone (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidetone]) is too loud.  This will be addressed in a GSM firmware update

====== Bad block ======
Due to an error in the production process, the factory-programmed NAND bad block information has been lost.  This means that some blocks in the flash will wear out rapidly, which might become as bad as rendering the device unusable.

==== GTA01Bv4 ====
This is the version that will be shipped in Phase 1

===== Changes from GTA01Bv3 =====
# Fix all Errata items from GTA01Bv3
# Add I2C, SPI and one irq and wakeup capable GPIO pin to debug port plus have test pads for all these signals (for soldering wires directly on the pcb)
# Fix a number of production related details and minor hardware details that are not user-visible

== Distinguishing hardware revisions ==
=== Inside the [[Bootloader]] ===
Every hardware revision has its own u-boot image type.  Thus, the bootloader has the revision hard-coded.
The hardware revision is passed on to the kernel via the ATAG mechanism (ATAG_REVISION)

=== Inside the [[Kernel]] ===
The kernel receives the ATAG_REVISION during bootup, and saves its contents in the "system_rev" global variable.

=== From Userspace ===
The kernel exports the system_rev variable in /proc/cpuinfo as "Revision :" line.
