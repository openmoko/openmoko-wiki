GSM, Bluetooth & WLAN turned off (some kind of lock so no app can turn them on?)
GPS on per request (it's ok to have it on in aeroplanes)


==FSO-based distros==
For FSO-based distros that don't have a GUI to do this you can use the commands below from the terminal, or add them to a script. The dbus-send command could be used instead of mdbus for faster execution, but the syntax is slightly different. Full documentation for the FSO commands can be found [http://git.freesmartphone.org/?p=specs.git;a=blob_plain;f=html/org.freesmartphone.GSM.Device.html;hb=HEAD#SetAntennaPower here] and [http://git.freesmartphone.org/?p=specs.git;a=blob_plain;f=html/org.freesmartphone.Usage.html;hb=HEAD#SetResourcePolicy here]

===GSM antenna down (stops RF but leaves the SIM available for phonebook & SMS):===

 mdbus -s org.freesmartphone.ogsmd /org/freesmartphone/GSM/Device org.freesmartphone.GSM.Device.SetAntennaPower False

To enable it again use the same command with True instead of False.

===GSM entirely down:===

 mdbus -s org.freesmartphone.ousaged /org/freesmartphone/Usage org.freesmartphone.Usage.SetResourcePolicy GSM disabled

To set it back to normal use the same command with auto in place of disabled.

===Bluetooth down:===

 mdbus -s org.freesmartphone.ousaged /org/freesmartphone/Usage org.freesmartphone.Usage.SetResourcePolicy Bluetooth disabled

To set it back to normal use the same command with auto in place of disabled.

===WLAN down:===

 mdbus -s org.freesmartphone.ousaged /org/freesmartphone/Usage org.freesmartphone.Usage.SetResourcePolicy WiFi disabled

To set it back to normal use the same command with auto in place of disabled.
