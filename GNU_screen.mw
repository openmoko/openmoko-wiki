'''GNU screen''' is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100 VT100] terminal multiplexer, default installed tool in [[SHR]]. The started terminal processes are [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_%28computer_science%29 persistent] and shareable.

It can, among others, be used for making [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_terminal virtual terminal]s, and to do serial communication with a physical or virtual [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_port serial port] (typical RS-232):
*man screen

Typical test if any GNU screen processes exist:
 screen -list
 # Response:
 # No Sockets found in /tmp/screens/S-root.

Typical usage:
 screen
 # Response:
 # Screen version 4.00.03 (FAU) 23-Oct-06
 # ...
 # [Press Space or Return to end.]
 # Do either of this to enter the created GNU screen.

 screen -list
 # There is a screen on:
 #       8291.pts-3.om-gta02     ('''Attached''')
 # 1 Socket in /tmp/screens/S-root.

On purpose disconnect a GNU screen process:
 <ctrl>a d
 # Response: [detached]
 # You should see the terminal in a former [different] state.

See if the disconnection worked:
 screen -list
 # There is a screen on:
 #        8291.pts-3.om-gta02     ('''Detached''')
 # 1 Socket in /tmp/screens/S-root.

Reconnect to a GNU screen:
 screen -RD 8291
 # You should see the terminal in another [different] state.

Make update and upgrade in the GNU screen process:
 opkg update;opkg upgrade;sync;sync;sync
 # Sync info:
 # http://www.oreillynet.com/linux/cmd/cmd.csp?path=s/sync
 # I think it will prevent data loss if FR looses power/unclean power off.

If you now loose ssh connection to your FR it does not matter - the upgrade proceeds (as long as the FR does not sleep - if the touchscreen goes black please tap the touchscreen to prevent sleep).

If you do loose the ssh connection, you ought to be able to restart the wi-fi interface, start a ssh connection to FR and reconnect to GNU screen process and see the last couple of lines and see how the upgrade ended.
