Interested in using FreeBSD on the Neo1973 or as a Host OS? Get in touch with andrew -at- fubar.geek.nz, they are currently exploring what to do about this.


== Running FreeBSD in Qemu-neo1973 ==
A FreeBSD port is only ready for kernel developers.

=== Required tools ===
You will need:
# mkimage from u-boot. It's available in ports in devel/u-boot
# makefs from ports in sysutils/makefs

==== Qemu ====
To build Qemu on FreeBSD to test and develop FreeBSD on the Neo's:
# Use subversion to checkout https://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/src/host/qemu-neo1973
# In gnokiigsm/device.h comment out the declaration for device_read and device_write, see [[Talk:Openmoko under QEMU#FreeBSD_and_Qemu...]]
# Edit Makefile.target, search for the line LIBS+=-lm and insert "-L/usr/lib" before "-lm"
# If your running FreeBSD on an AMD64 edit x86_64.ld and remove all occurrences of ONLY_IF_RO and ONLY_IF_RW
# Run ./configure --target-list=arm-softmmu and gmake
# Edit openmoko/flash.sh to add kernel_image="/path/to/kernel.boot" between the calls to most_recent and where it prints the kernel image it will use

=== Building FreeBSD ===
You will need to download http://fubar.geek.nz/files/freebsd/neo1973/neo-20080629.tar.bz2 to build FreeBSD for the Neo1973.

From the FreeBSD src tree run:
<pre>
make buildworld TARGET=arm TARGET_ARCH=arm TARGET_CPUTYPE=arm920t
make installworld TARGET=arm TARGET_ARCH=arm TARGET_CPUTYPE=arm920t DESTDIR=/path/to/root/fs
</pre>

You will now need to trim down /path/to/root to remove things noot needed to test in single user mode
<pre>
makefs -B little /path/to/root.ufs /path/to/root/fs
make buildkernel TARGET=arm TARGET_ARCH=arm TARGET_CPUTYPE=arm920t KERNCONF=NEO1973 -DNO_MODULES MFS_IMAGE=/path/to/root.ufs
mkimage -A arm -O freebsd -T kernel -C none -a 30008000 -e 300080e0 -n "FreeBSD" -d /usr/obj/path/to/kernel /usr/obj/same/path/kernel.boot
</pre>

You will now have a copy of FreeBSD that is able to be loaded by u-boot.

=== Running FreeBSD ===
From the qemu directory run
<code>
 ./openmoko/download.sh
 ./openmoko/flash.sh
</code>

This will fetch the required parts and create an image to run. They require you to have bash installed.

Finally run qemu with
<code>
 arm-softmmu/qemu-system-arm -M gta01 -m 130 -mtdblock openmoko/openmoko-flash.image -kernel openmoko/openmoko-kernel.bin -usb -show-cursor
</code>

It will display "Kernel loading..." with no further messages.

You can append
 -serial telnet:localhost:1200,server
to the qemu startup line to start a telnet server which represents the serial console, just
 telnet localhost 1200
and qemu will go on with the startup process.

== Using a Kernel Testimage ==
Another method of getting the kernel into the neo is to use an image for the emulated sd card.
I already have a file called sd.img ( dd'ed from a 32mb usb stick).
 cp /usr/obj/arm/usr/src/sys/NEO1973/kernel .
 /usr/obj/arm/usr/src/tmp/usr/bin/objcopy -O binary kernel
 sudo mdconfig -a -t vnode -f sd.img
 sudo mount_msdosfs /dev/md0s1 /mnt/tmp
 sudo cp kernel /mnt/tmp/
 sudo umount /mnt/tmp
 sudo mdconfig -d -u 0
 arm-softmmu/qemu-system-arm -M neo -m 130 -mtdblock openmoko/openmoko-flash.image -kernel openmoko/openmoko-kernel.bin -sd sd.img -usb -show-cursor -serial telnet:localhost:1200,server
In another terminal:
 telnet localhost 1200
 mmcinit
 fatload mmc 0 0x30008000 kernel
 go 0x30008000
And wait for the crash :)

== Kernel Constants ==
* KERNVIRTADDR is the virtual address at which the kernel is loaded (and linked) (0xc0008000)
* KERNPHYSADDR is the physical address at which the kernel is loaded (0x30008000)
* PHYSADDR is the physical address of the RAM (0x30000000)
* KERNBASE is the virtual address of the beginning of the kernel virtual address space (0xc0000000)
* STARTUP_PAGETABLE_ADDR is a physical address, suitable for the very early pagetable we build in locore.S (0x30800000)
* FLASHADDR is the address of the flash, virtual or physical depending on what the loader does (??)
* LOADERRAMADDR the address at which the loader maps the RAM if we're running with the MMU enabled, and the physical address if not (??)

== Headers ==
u-boot header size: 64 Bytes
elf header size: ??
