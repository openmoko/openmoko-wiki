Interested in using FreeBSD on the Neo1973 or as a Host OS? Get in touch with mn -at- bsdgroup.de and andrew -at- fubar.geek.nz, they are currently exploring what to do about this.


== Running FreeBSD in Qemu-neo1973 ==
A FreeBSD port is only ready for kernel developers.

=== Required tools ===
You will need mkimage from u-boot. It's available in Ports under devel/u-boot.

You will also need Qemu-neo1973. Hints on building it are avaliable from [[Talk:OpenMoko under QEMU|this page.]]

=== Building FreeBSD ===
You will need to download http://fubar.geek.nz/files/freebsd/neo1973/neo1973-0.20070917.tar.bz2 and extract it over the FreeBSD src tree.

From the FreeBSD src tree run:
 <code>
 make buildworld TARGET=arm TARGET_ARCH=arm TARGET_CPUTYPE=arm920t
 make buildkernel TARGET=arm TARGET_ARCH=arm TARGET_CPUTYPE=arm920t KERNCONF=NEO1973
 gzip -9 usr/obj/path/to/kernel
 /path/to/mkimage -A arm -O freebsd -T kernel -C gzip -a 30008000 -e 30008000 -n "Kernel Image" -d /usr/obj/path/to/kernel.gz /usr/obj/same/path/kernel.boot
 </code>

You will now have a copy of FreeBSD that is able to be loaded by u-boot.

=== Running FreeBSD ===
From the qemu directory edit the openmoko/flash.sh and add the line
 <code>
 kernel_image="/usr/obj/path/to/kernel.boot"
 </code>
after the four "most_recent" lines.

Next run
 <code>
 ./openmoko/download.sh
 ./openmoko/flash.sh
 </code>

This will fetch the required parts and create an image to run. They require you to have bash installed.

Finally run qemu with
 <code>
 arm-softmmu/qemu-system-arm -M neo -m 130 -mtdblock openmoko/openmoko-flash.image -kernel openmoko/openmoko-kernel.bin -usb -show-cursor
 </code>

It will display "Kernel loading..." with no further messages.

You can append
 -serial telnet:localhost:1200,server
to the qemu startup line to start a telnet server which represents the serial console, just
 telnet localhost 1200
and qemu will go on with the startup process.
