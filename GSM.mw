'''GSM''', ([http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/GSM Global System for Mobile communications]) is the phone standard supported by the Neo1973.
Future phones may support other standards.

The Neo1973 is quad-band (GSM 850, 900, 1800, 1900), and will work in most countries, with the exception of some of the US, and some other parts of the world.

The GSM features (such as dialing) will be programmed via [[Gsmd]].
