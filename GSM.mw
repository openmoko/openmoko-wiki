The [http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/GSM Global System for Mobile communications] is the phone standard supported by the Neo1973.
Future phones may support other standards.
The Neo1973 is quad-band, and will work in most countries, with the exception of some of the US, and other parts.

You can find a full list of GSM/3GPP standards at [http://webapp.etsi.org/key/key.asp?full_list=y this ETSI site] (attention! more than 2000 entries).
