'''GSM''', ([http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/GSM Global System for Mobile communications]) is the phone standard and network type supported by the [[Neo1973]]. Future phones may support other standards.

GSM covers making phone calls, sending '''SMS''' text messages, and access to Internet via '''GPRS'''. A '''SIM''' ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscriber_Identity_Module Subscriber Identity Module]) card is given along the contract with an operator, and the customer inserts the card in the phone to authorize it. The card is plastic (approximately 15mm*23mm*1mm) with several gold contacts on, and it determines the mobile phone 'number' and what network the phone is on.

The Neo1973 phone can be used with any operator that has a GSM network; it is quad-band and thus supports every frequency (850, 900, 1800, and 1900 MHz). Thus it will work in most countries, with the exception of some of the US and some other parts of the world that completely lack GSM coverage.

== Applications ==

Calls can be placed using the graphical [[Dialer]] or the textual gsmd-tool.

Rest needs to be done on the command-line [[manually using GSM]] and [[manually using GPRS]], until [[gsmd]] supports more.

== Programming ==

The GSM features (including dialing, SMS, GPRS, and SIM access) will be programmed via [[gsmd]].

== Standards information ==
