'''GSM''', ([http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/GSM Global System for Mobile communications]) is the phone standard and network type supported by the [[Neo1973]]. Future phones may support other standards.

GSM covers making phone calls, sending '''SMS''' text messages, and access to Internet via '''GPRS'''. A '''SIM''' ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscriber_Identity_Module Subscriber Identity Module]) card is given along the contract with an [[operator]], and the customer inserts the card in the phone to authorize it for use other than emergency dialling. The card is plastic (approximately 15mm*23mm*1mm) with 8 electrical contacts on. It's main purpose is identifying for the phone, the relationship between the contractor and the operator. This includes information about the mobile phone number, the home network, sms center phone number etc. The user (i.e. phone) usually has some amount of storage available on the card for a simple phonebook. SIM cards are standard [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_7816 ISO/IEC 7816] smart cards with a special SIM application on it.

The Neo1973 phone should work with any operator that has a GSM network (see [[Neo1973 compatible cellphone providers]]); it is quad-band and thus supports every frequency (850, 900, 1800, and 1900 MHz). Thus it will work in most countries, with the exception of some of the US and some other parts of the world that completely lack GSM coverage.

== Applications ==

Calls can be placed using the graphical [[Dialer]] or the textual gsmd-tool.

Rest needs to be done on the command-line [[manually using GSM]] and [[manually using GPRS]], until [[gsmd]] supports more.

== Programming ==

The GSM features (including dialing, SMS, GPRS, and SIM access) will be programmed via [[gsmd]].

== Standards information ==

=== GSM 07.07 - Main AT commands ===

07.07 describes the main commands used by the [[Gsmd]] software of the Openmoko system to communicate via a serial interface with the GSM subsystem of the phone.

Note that the descendant of this specification is [http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/27007.htm 3GPP TS 27.007 - AT command set for User Equipment (UE)]. (Does OpenMoko support any of these newer versions?)
