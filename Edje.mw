= Edje =

In most Openmoko FreeRunner distributions, the graphical environment is the Illume module of the [http://www.enlightenment.org/ Enlightenment 17] window manager. Under this environment, the windows decorations and behavior are managed by a graphical library called ''Edge''. Accordingly, the theme is defined in a ''.edj'' file.

On the FreeRunner, Edje themes are stored at ''/usr/share/enlightenment/data/themes''. Which theme gets loaded by default is defined via the symlink ''/usr/share/enlightenment/data/themes/illume.edj''. To use a custom theme, simply put a '''.edj'' file to ''~/.e/e/themes/illume.edj''.

A ''.edj'' file is a collection of possibly several files, including images and even fonts in some cases (see [http://web.enlightenment.org/p.php?p=docs&l=en E17 documentation]). It allows to change the background image (see the [[Changing wallpaper]] example) but is much more powerful than that. Along with the visual definitions and elements, it includes programmatic statements controlling interaction between GUI elements and between GUI and application.  For instance, the dialer may have three 'program' triggers written into the edje for each button - change GUI to 'pressed', change GUI to 'released', and add digit to number.  Unlike traditional ideas about theming, this interaction is defined in the 'theme' instead of the application itself.  This allows for unprecedented flexibility insofar as 'theming' - you can change button layouts, graphics, even add some features like 'delete last digit' all within the .edj.

If you want to play around with edje themes here are two approaches:

1. Use ''edje-editor''.  Keep in mind that the editor works, quite nicely in some regards, but has some flaws and some distinctly missing features like it can't remove a no-longer-used background image from the .edj file. See [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-October/034477.html this message].

2. Alternatively, as explained below, use ''edje-decc'' to decompile the theme back to config files and images and what-not, manually edit the aforementioned parts, and recompile with ''edje-cc''.  These two tools should be available in your friendly package feed for your Freerunner as ''edje-tools'', and possibly for your desktop linux.

Edje uses *.edj Files as binary-configuration files and *.edc as the source of such an *.edj file.

= Installing the Edge compiler/decompiler =

== Installation on Ubuntu ==
You can install edje_cc and edje_decc for Ubuntu by adding this source to your /etc/apt/sources.lst:
deb http://e17.dunnewind.net/ubuntu hardy e17
or
deb http://e17.dunnewind.net/ubuntu gutsy e17
or
deb http://e17.dunnewind.net/ubuntu feisty e17
After that you can install the needed tools with:
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libedje-bin

Note: It appears only packages for hardy exist there at this point.

== Installation on Debian ==
The packages for Ubuntu look like they are compatible with debian.
Verified is: feisty<->lenny

Unfortunately, something seems to be broken in recompiling the edjefiles. edje_cc reports syntax errors in fso.edj file; but that comes maybe from the file itself. Maybe edje_cc from ubuntu is just outdated?


It looks like edje is available in [http://packages.debian.org/libedje-bin debian] unstable.

== Installation on Freerunner ==
To compile/decompile Edje files directly at your freerunner, you first need to install several packages.
You need at least ''edje-utils'' which provides the compiler and decompiler tools.
Depending on the contents of the theme, you need additional modules which are provided by ''libevas-*'' packages.
For example, to be able to load and save JPG files, you need both the ''libevas-loader-jpeg'' and ''libevas-saver-jpg'' packages.

To successfully compile .edj files, you also need a C++ compiler and the embryo_cc scripting language compiler installed.

This line should get you started:
opkg install edje-utils libevas-loader-jpeg libevas-loader-png libevas-saver-jpeg libevas-saver-png


To decompile an theme, just type:
root@om-gta02:/usr/share/enlightenment/data/themes# edje_decc illume.edj

To recompile, you can use edje_cc, but most theme files have a build.sh bundled that provides the neccessary parameters:
root@om-gta02:/usr/share/enlightenment/data/themes/illume# ./build.sh

 Not so simple, but it seems to be the right place... check for "*" or
 "+", they are in the .edc In place, I've added the value "Bar;" in the Categories of
 "qtopia-clock.desktop" and "qtopia-ringtones.desktop" to get these two
 appli accessible from the bottom bar.

= Troubleshooting =
If something goes wrong at compiling time, there is most certainly something wrong in your freerunner.edc file. The problem is, that edjecc will complain with cryptical text.
Check if all files referenced are really there and if no syntax errors are present.

In order to install the new theme, it must be referenced (see above) and illume must be restarted.
