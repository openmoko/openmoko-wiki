= Edje =
Is a configuration-file format which origins of [http://www.enlightenment.org/ Enlightenment 17]. It is used by [[Openmoko]] and [[Illume]] for configuring a lot of the look of [[Openmoko]] and its applications. It allows you, for example, to change the background image but is much more powerful then that.

Please note, however, that for [[CustomizeApplicationIcons|changing application icons]] it is not necessary to compile theme files.

Edje uses *.edj Files as binary-configuration files and *.edc as the source of such an *.edj file.

For compiling an *.edc file to an *.edj file you need: edje_cc
For decompiling an *.edj file to an *.edc file you need: edje_decc (you might want to do this to learn about how such a file has to look like)

Edje themes are stored at ''usr/share/enlightenment/data/themes''.
Which theme gets loaded by default, is defined in ''/etc/enlightenment/default_profile''.

= Installation = 
== Installation on Freerunner ==
To compile/decompile Edje files directly at your freerunner, you first need to install several packages.
You need at least ''edje-utils'' which provides the compiler and decompiler tools.
Depending on the contents of the theme, you need additional modules which are provided by ''libevas-*'' packages.
For example, to be able to load and save JPG files, you need both the ''libevas-loader-jpeg'' and ''libevas-saver-jpg'' packages.

Issuing the following command should install needed files for the most cases:
 opkg install edje-utils libevas-loader-jpeg libevas-loader-png libevas-loader-svg libevas-saver-jpeg libevas-saver-png



== Installation on Ubuntu ==
You can install edje_cc and edje_decc for Ubuntu by adding this source to your /etc/apt/sources.lst:
 deb http://e17.dunnewind.net/ubuntu hardy e17
or
 deb http://e17.dunnewind.net/ubuntu gutsy e17
or
 deb http://e17.dunnewind.net/ubuntu feisty e17
After that you can install the needed tools with:
 sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libedje-bin
