= Edje =
Is a configuration-file format which origins of [http://www.enlightenment.org/ Enlightenment 17]. It is used by [[Openmoko]] and [[Illume]] for configuring a lot of the look of [[Openmoko]] and its applications.

Edje uses *.edj Files as binary-configuration files and *.edc as the source of such an *.edj file.

For compiling an *.edc file to an *.edj file you need: edje_cc
For decompiling an *.edj file to an *.edc file you need: edje_decc (you might want to do this to learn about how such a file has to look like)
