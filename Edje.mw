= Edje =
Is a configuration-file format which origins of [http://www.enlightenment.org/ Enlightenment 17]. It is used by Openmoko and [[Illume]] for configuring a lot of the look of Openmoko and its applications. It allows you, for example, to change the background image but is much more powerful then that.

Please note, however, that for [[CustomizeApplicationIcons|changing application icons]] it is not necessary to compile theme files.

Edje uses *.edj Files as binary-configuration files and *.edc as the source of such an *.edj file.

For compiling an *.edc file to an *.edj file you need: edje_cc
For decompiling an *.edj file to an *.edc file you need: edje_decc (you might want to do this to learn about how such a file has to look like)

Edje themes are stored at ''/usr/share/enlightenment/data/themes''.
Which theme gets loaded by default, is defined in ''/etc/enlightenment/default_profile''.

= Installation = 

== Installation on Ubuntu ==
You can install edje_cc and edje_decc for Ubuntu by adding this source to your /etc/apt/sources.lst:
 deb http://e17.dunnewind.net/ubuntu hardy e17
or
 deb http://e17.dunnewind.net/ubuntu gutsy e17
or
 deb http://e17.dunnewind.net/ubuntu feisty e17
After that you can install the needed tools with:
 sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libedje-bin

Note: It appears only packages for hardy exist there at this point.

== Installation on Debian ==
The packages for Ubuntu look like they are compatible with debian.
Verified is: feisty<->lenny

Unfortunately, something seems to be broken in recompiling the edjefiles. edje_cc reports syntax errors in fso.edj file; but that comes maybe from the file itself. Maybe edje_cc from ubuntu is just outdated?


It looks like edje is available in [http://packages.debian.org/libedje-bin debian] unstable.

== Installation on Freerunner ==
To compile/decompile Edje files directly at your freerunner, you first need to install several packages.
You need at least ''edje-utils'' which provides the compiler and decompiler tools.
Depending on the contents of the theme, you need additional modules which are provided by ''libevas-*'' packages.
For example, to be able to load and save JPG files, you need both the ''libevas-loader-jpeg'' and ''libevas-saver-jpg'' packages.

To successfully compile .edj files, you also need a C++ compiler and the embryo_cc scripting language compiler installed.

This line should get you started:
 opkg install edje-utils libevas-loader-jpeg libevas-loader-png libevas-saver-jpeg libevas-saver-png


To decompile an theme, just type:
  root@om-gta02:/usr/share/enlightenment/data/themes# edje_decc illume.edj

To recompile, you can use edje_cc, but most theme files have a build.sh bundled that provides the neccessary parameters:
  root@om-gta02:/usr/share/enlightenment/data/themes/illume# ./build.sh

 Not so simple, but it seems to be the right place... check for "*" or
 "+", they are in the .edc In place, I've added the value "Bar;" in the Categories of
 "qtopia-clock.desktop" and "qtopia-ringtones.desktop" to get these two
 appli accessible from the bottom bar.
