A number of manufacturers produce modular components suitable for embedded systems. Some of these components are suitable for a hobbyist to put together a modular phone. This page is intended as a starting-point for building an OpenMoko compatible phone.

The major problem with this approach is that the resultant phone tends to be larger than a normal phone.

This is because though they may be designed to be compact, internal connectors add lots of volume compared to a PCB, where everything can be in one unit.

This is more than likely true. Gumstix produce 3D models in Sketchup format, of all their components - I will produce a 3D mockup using the components listed below, upload it here and make a size comparison.

==Component Suppliers==
*[http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/categories.php Spark Fun]
*[http://gumstix.com/ Gumstix]
*[http://www.ebay.com/ Ebay - assorted mobile phone spares]
*[http://www.jandrew-elec.com/acatalog/Siemens_GSM_GPRS_EDGE_Modules.html GSM/HDSPA/UMTS modules]

==Possible configuration 1==
* Gumstix verdex (600MHz Intel Xscale PXA270, 128MB RAM, 64MB flash) - $170USD.
* Goliath-GPS-vx GSM/GPRS/EDGE/LCD touchscreen/audio/3D accelerometer module - $100.
** This seems very unlikely. It is almost certainly below cost, based on prices of included components $150-$200 is around the minimum.
* microSD breakout board [http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=544] - $15USD.
* 480 x 272px LCD [http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=8335] - $70USD.
* Battery, holder, charger circuitry - $20USD
* Case - $40USD.
* Speakers, mic - $10USD.
* Buttons - $5USD.
* USB WiFi dongle (also, forthcoming gumstix modules will add wifi to the verdex mobo range) - $20.

The prices for the Goliath daughter cards are realeased on monday 16th July 2007, and should be around $100USD, giving a total of around $450+, which compares with the Neo1973 at $450.

Prices will be reduced, if we as the OpenMoko community buy in bulk.

Capabilities wise, this compares well with the Neo - there is no accelerated graphics and the screen resolution is smaller, but it does have EDGE and a faster processor. Otherwise specs are similar.

From Sketchup models supplied by Gumstix, the size will be around 120 x 67 x 17mm. This is the smallest cuboid into which the components will fit. The case will add approx. 2mm to this - battery, screen, microSD and other components should fit into voids between the main circuit boards.

Where relevant, all components listed here have Linux kernel modules supplied by their manufacturer.

[http://hbmobile.org Home Brew Mobile Phone Club] have a site devoted to build-it-yourself mobile phones, based upon Gumstix motherboards. They have schematics, case designs and details of suitable components from many sources.
