The codename '''GTA04''' was picked up in 2010 by Golden Delicious Computers to develop a new motherboard for our open smartphone that follows the original idea and goals.

There is a new project page: http://www.gta04.org, which houses the wiki specific to the GTA04 project at Golden Delicious. 

== GTA04A4 ==

GTA04A4 is a new motherboard, that replaces the one inside your Neo Freerunner ([[GTA02]]). It reuses the case, the battery and the display.

The GTA04A4 motherboard PCB layout development is based on GTA04A3 and its start was announced at 7. october 2011.([http://lists.goldelico.com/pipermail/gta04-owner/2011-October/000385.html source])

It is assumed that the [http://www.handheld-linux.com/wiki.php?page=GTA04 populated GTA04 replacement motherboard will be available here].

== History ==

=== Year 2011: GTA04A3 (Early Adopter) ===
The GTA04A3 was released and shipped 10. october 2011.

The GTA04A3 milestone was announced 7. october 2011.([http://lists.goldelico.com/pipermail/gta04-owner/2011-October/000385.html source])

GTA04A3 is a new motherboard, that replaces the one inside your Neo1973/Freerunner ([[GTA02]]). It reuses the case, the battery and the display. GTA04A3 features ([http://projects.goldelico.com/p/gta04-main/page/GTA04-revisions/ source]):

* [http://focus.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/dm3730.pdf TI OMAP 3730] DCBB (800 MHz) (compatible to [http://www.beagleboard.org])
** integrated graphics - POWERVR SGX Graphics Accelerator of OMAP3730
* 512MB RAM/512MB NAND ([http://www.micron.com/products/ProductDetails.html?product=products/mcp/multichip_packages/MT29C4G96MAZAPCJG-5+IT Micron 8Gb DDR/NAND PoP Memory])
* Wi2Wi WLAN/Bluetooth module + antenna
* GTM601W UMTS module
* GPS module + antenna switch 
* Option:
** LIS302 (accelerometer)
** LSM303 (compass and accelerometer)
** ITG3200 (gyroscope)
** BMP085 (barometric altimeter)
** BMA180 (accelerometer) 
** Si4721 or Si4705 (FM transceiver/receiver) 

The early adopter program was available at: http://www.handheld-linux.com/wiki.php?page=GTA04-Early-Adopter

=== Year 2010: GTA04A2 ===

The GTA04A2 was the result of integrating GTA04A1/[[Openmoko Beagle Hybrid]] all onto a single PCB.

GTA04A2 was presented at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSDEM FOSDEM] 2011.

=== Year 2010: Openmoko Beagle Hybrid GTA04A1 (Golden Delicious Computers) ===
Golden Delicious Computers has been secretly working on a OMAP3530 based project that apparently has the same target as Openmoko's GTA04 did have. The first result was announced in 2010 [[Openmoko Beagle Hybrid]] aka GTA04A1.

=== Year 2008: Openmoko Inc. GTA04 ===
'''GTA04''' was the codename of a phone that was whose development was canceled (within Openmoko, Inc.). For more information about other phones in development, visit [[Phone Development]]. This phone would have been based on a different system-on-a-chip.

==== GTA04 specifications ====
The GTA04 would have been a [[GTA03]] but with a major hardware revision 

New:
* USB 2.0 would be added on the GTA04 at the earliest
* 3G would be added on the GTA04 at the earliest
* Based on a more advanced SoC
* maybe based on the samsung 6400 or 6410
* integrated graphics
* Sean put a hiring on the community and devel list, see [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-September/029710.html here] so there will be OpenGL Es and the 6410 eventually
* there had been meetings in April 2008 within Openmoko - see [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/openmoko-kernel/2008-April/002310.html]
