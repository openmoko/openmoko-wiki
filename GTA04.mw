== History ==

=== Year 2011: Openmoko Beagle Hybrid GTA04 ===
Golden Delicious Computers has been secretly working on a OMAP3530 based project that apparently has the same target as Openmoko's GTA04 did have. The first result was announced in 2010 [[Openmoko Beagle Hybrid]].

The "new" GTA04 is the result of integrating that all onto a single PCB.

=== Year 2008: Openmoko Inc. GTA04 ===
'''GTA04''' was the codename of a phone that was whose development was canceled (within Openmoko, Inc.). For more information about other phones in development, visit [[Phone Development]]. This phone would have been based on a different system-on-a-chip.

==== GTA04 specifications ====
The GTA04 would have been a [[GTA03]] but with a major hardware revision 

New:
* USB 2.0 would be added on the GTA04 at the earliest
* 3G would be added on the GTA04 at the earliest
* Based on a more advanced SoC
* maybe based on the samsung 6400 or 6410
* integrated graphics
* Sean put a hiring on the community and devel list, see [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-September/029710.html here] so there will be OpenGL Es and the 6410 eventually
* there had been meetings in April 2008 within Openmoko - see [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/openmoko-kernel/2008-April/002310.html]
