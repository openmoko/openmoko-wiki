The codename '''GTA04''' was picked up in 2010 by Golden Delicious Computers to develop a new motherboard for our open smartphone that follows the original idea and goals.

== GTA04A3 (Early Adopter) ==
Which to expect? A new motherboard, that replaces the one inside your Neo1973/Freerunner. It will reuse the case, the battery and the display. It is known as GTA04A3 (Early Adopter) and its feature might be:

* TI OMAP 3530 DCBB (600/720/; maybe DM3730 with 1GHz) (compatible to [http://www.beagleboard.org])
** integrated graphics - POWERVR SGX Graphics Accelerator of OMAP3530
* Micron DDR/NAND PoP Memory
* Option GTM601W UMTS module
* Wi2Wi WLAN/Bluetooth module + antenna
* GPS module + antenna switch 
* LIS302 (accelerometer)
* LSM303 (compass and accelerometer)
* ITG3200 (gyroscope)
* BMP085 (barometric altimeter)
* Si4721 (FM transceiver) 

Development samples are scheduled to become available around FOSDEM 2011. 

There is a new project page: http://www.gta04.org, which houses the wiki specific to the GTA04 project at Golden Delicious. 

An early adopter program is available at: http://www.handheld-linux.com/wiki.php?page=GTA04-Early-Adopter
 
== History ==

=== Year 2011: Golden Delicious Computers Openmoko Beagle Hybrid GTA04 ===
Golden Delicious Computers has been secretly working on a OMAP3530 based project that apparently has the same target as Openmoko's GTA04 did have. The first result was announced in 2010 [[Openmoko Beagle Hybrid]] aka GTA04A1.

The next GTA04 was the result of integrating that all onto a single PCB aka GTA04A2.

=== Year 2008: Openmoko Inc. GTA04 ===
'''GTA04''' was the codename of a phone that was whose development was canceled (within Openmoko, Inc.). For more information about other phones in development, visit [[Phone Development]]. This phone would have been based on a different system-on-a-chip.

==== GTA04 specifications ====
The GTA04 would have been a [[GTA03]] but with a major hardware revision 

New:
* USB 2.0 would be added on the GTA04 at the earliest
* 3G would be added on the GTA04 at the earliest
* Based on a more advanced SoC
* maybe based on the samsung 6400 or 6410
* integrated graphics
* Sean put a hiring on the community and devel list, see [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-September/029710.html here] so there will be OpenGL Es and the 6410 eventually
* there had been meetings in April 2008 within Openmoko - see [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/openmoko-kernel/2008-April/002310.html]
