'''GTA04''' was the codename of a phone that was whose development was canceled. For more information about other phones in development, visit [[Phone Development]]. This phone would have been based on a different system-on-a-chip.

{{Speculations}}

== GTA04 specifications ==
The GTA04 would have been a [[GTA03]] but with a major hardware revision 

New:
* USB 2.0 would be added on the GTA04 at the earliest
* 3G would be added on the GTA04 at the earliest
* Based on a more advanced SoC
* maybe based on the samsung 6400 or 6410
* Sean put a hiring on the community and devel list, see [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-September/029710.html here] so there will be OpenGL Es and the 6410 eventually
* integrated graphics

== Openmoko Beagle Hybrid ==
Golden Delicious Computers has been secretly working on a OMAP3530 based project that apparently has the same target as Openmoko's GTA04 did have. The first result was announced recently [[Openmoko Beagle Hybrid]].

Although there isn't much information yet, which features can we expect?

* USB 2.0 - OMAP3530 supports full OTG (High-Speed USB 2.0 with Client & Host mode)
* 3G - let's hope so
* Based on a more advanced SoC - OMAP3530 with 720 MHz
* maybe based on the samsung 6400 or 6410 - OMAP3530 with 720 MHz
* integrated graphics - POWERVR SGX Graphics Accelerator of OMAP3530
* others - new motherboard for existing Freerunner, GPS
