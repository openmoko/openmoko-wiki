== GTA04 specifications ==
The GTA04 would have been a [[GTA03]] but with a major hardware revision 

New:
* USB 2.0 would be added on the GTA04 at the earliest
* 3G would be added on the GTA04 at the earliest
* Based on a more advanced SoC
* maybe based on the samsung 6400 or 6410
* Sean put a hiring on the community and devel list, see [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-September/029718.html here] so there will be OpenGL Es and the 6410 eventually
* integrated graphics
