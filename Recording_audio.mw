== For the impatient ==

In order to record audio you need a special alsa state file and we provide a link to one that works below (SHA1:55888a699e969c5e2c4690e6aff47ccad7ad0f3d). It can be used to put the device into voice recording mode. 

 alsactl -f [http://svn.arhuaco.org/svn/src/openmoko/misc-files/ALSA/voip-handset.state voip-handset.state] restore
 arecord -D hw -f cd  -v -t wav rec-$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M).wav

With these commands you'll get a file in Waveform audio format (WAV) in the local directory.

== Information for developers ==

Mixer settings for voice recording: It is required that DAI Mode (alsa control number 50) is "DAI 2". As of Feb/23 "DAI 1" mode is broken. Not all the DAI modes work and people are working on this.
