The following links are in place to provide developers with a pre-compiled [[OpenEmbedded]] build environment tailored to their workstation's architecture. In order to use BitTorrent files, it is necessary to install a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_client BitTorrent client].

The reason that these torrents are provided, is to decrease the amount of time it takes for system developers to have a fully functional build environment, allowing them to focus on more important tasks. A positive side effect of providing a pre-compiled environment, is that new developers do not feel overwhelmed or dissuaded by the time it takes to build an OE build environment from scratch.

Once the environment is downloaded via [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent BitTorrent], simply untar the archive to a location of your choice with plenty of hard-disk space, export the environment variable OE_HOME, and go!
