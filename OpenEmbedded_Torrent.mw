The following links are in place to provide developers with a pre-compiled [[OpenEmbedded]] build environment tailored to their workstation's architecture. In order to use BitTorrent files, it is necessary to install a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_client BitTorrent client].

The reason that these torrents are provided, is to decrease the amount of time it takes for system developers to have a fully functional build environment, allowing them to focus on more important tasks. 

'''Note:''' A pre-compiled OE environment is several gigabytes in size. For example, an environment may be require 8GB to download and store, but it might require another 16 GB to uncompress. Please ensure that you have enough disk space before continuing. 

Once the environment is downloaded via [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent BitTorrent], just follow these [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/OpenEmbedded_Torrent_Instructions instructions], and go!
