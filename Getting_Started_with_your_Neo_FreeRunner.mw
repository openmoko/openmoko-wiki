==Getting To Know Neo FreeRunner==
===Turning On Neo FreeRunner===
There are three ways to boot your Neo FreeRunner. You can power up into an Openmoko Image directly. 
Alternately, you may also boot into U-Boot via NAND Flash or NOR Flash, which will allow you to update the kernel and root filesystem.

====Log in Openmoko Image====
Press and hold Power button until Openmoko splash screen turns up. You may now release the Power button, and Neo FreeRunner will continue to boot into Openmoko Image.

====Log in U-Boot in NAND Flash====
Press and hold Power button, then press and hold AUX button. You can see BOOT MENU for NAND Flash.

You can download the connection tool from : http://svn.openmoko.org/developers/werner/neocon

Connect Neo FreeRunner to Linux host with USB cable and type in the following command in the terminal of a GNU/Linux host.

 ./neocon /dev/ttyACM0

===Flashing Neo FreeRunner===
As Openmoko development continues, Openmoko regularly releases updated versions of the Openmoko root filesystem, the kernel, and the U-Boot. These may be programmed into the Flash memory of Neo FreeRunner. You can use the USB cable and Openmoko provided tool to flash Neo FreeRunner.

Neo FreeRunner needs to boot into U-Boot when flashing.

You can download the flashing tool from: 
http://buildhost.openmoko.org/daily/neo1973/deploy/glibc/images/neo1973/dfu-util

====Flashing Kernel====
You can download the latest kernel from :
http://buildhost.openmoko.org/daily/neo1973/deploy/glibc/images/neo1973/

Type in the following command in the terminal of a GNU/Linux host.

 ./dfu-util -a kernel -R -D uImage-2.6.24+svnr4082-r4055-r3-neo1973.bin

When flashing succeeds

status(0) = No error condition is present<br>
Done!

====Flashing Root Filesystem====
You can download the latest root filesystem from :
http://buildhost.openmoko.org/daily/neo1973/deploy/glibc/images/neo1973/

Type in the following command in the terminal of a GNU/Linux host.

 ./dfu-util -a rootfs -R -D openmoko-devel-image-fic-gta02.jffs2

When flashing succeeds

status(0) = No error condition is present<br>
Done!

====Connect To Neo FreeRunner By USB Networking====

Connect Neo FreeRunner to Linux host with USB cable. After booting into Openmoko image, there will be a new interface, usb0, in your Linux host.

=====Manual Method=====
Type in the following command in the terminal of a GNU/Linux host.

 ifconfig usb0 192.168.0.200 netmask 255.255.255.0
 ssh root@192.168.0.202

Press Enter to pass the password.

=====Automatic Method=====
*Debian and derivatives (Ubuntu, Sidux etc.)
Edit /etc/network/interfaces

 auto usb0
 iface usb0 inet static
 address 192.168.0.200
 netmask 255.255.255.0

Restart the networking service and type in the following command in the terminal of GNU/Linux host.

 ssh root@192.168.0.202

Press Enter to pass the password.

=====Making things even more automatic=====
If you don't want to remember the IP number of your phone you can create an alias by adding the following line to your /etc/hosts:

 192.168.0.202   openmoko

Now it should immediately be possible to connect your phone using the following command line:

 ssh root@openmoko
