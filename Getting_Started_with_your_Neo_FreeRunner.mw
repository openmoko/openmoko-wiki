===Turning On Neo FreeRunner===
There are three ways to boot your Neo FreeRunner.

Alternately, you may also boot into U-Boot, which will allow you to update the kernel, root filesystem.

====OpenMoko Image From NAND Flash====
Press and hold Power button until OpenMoko splash screen shows up. You may now release the Power button, and Neo FreeRunner will continue to boot into OpenMoko Image.

====OpenMoko Image From NOR Flash====
Press and hold Power button and Auxiliary button simultaneously.

====Power Up Into U-Boot====

===Flashing Neo FreeRunner===
As Openmoko development continues, OpenMoko regularly releases updated versions of the Openmoko root filesystem, the kernel, and the U-Boot. These may be programmed into the Flash memory of Neo FreeRunner. You can use the USB cable and OpenMoko provided tool to flash Neo FreeRunner.

Neo FreeRunner needs to boot into U-Boot when flashing.

You can download the flashing tool from: 
http://buildhost.openmoko.org/daily/neo1973/deploy/glibc/images/neo1973/dfu-util

====Flashing Kernel====
You can download the latest kernel from :
http://buildhost.openmoko.org/daily/neo1973/deploy/glibc/images/neo1973/

Key in the command in the terminal of Linux host

./dfu-util -a kernel -R -D uImage-2.6.24+svnr4082-r4055-r3-neo1973.bin

When flashing succeeds

status(0) = No error condition is present
Done!

====Flashing Root Filesystem====
You can download the latest root filesystem from :
http://buildhost.openmoko.org/daily/neo1973/deploy/glibc/images/neo1973/

Key in the command in the terminal of Linux host

./dfu-util -a rootfs -R -D openmoko-devel-image-fic-gta02.jffs2

When flashing succeeds

status(0) = No error condition is present
Done!

====Connect To Neo FreeRunner By USB Networking====

Connect Neo FreeRunner to a Linux host with a USB cable. 
After booting to an Openmoko image, there will be a new interface, usb0, in your Linux host.

=====Manual Method=====
