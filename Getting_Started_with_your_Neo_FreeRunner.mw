# Remove the rear cover of the Neo FreeRunner by first holding the Neo FreeRunner on the side and then use your fingernail to prise off the rear cover at the slot on top of the device.
# Now you should be able to locate the combined SIM and Micro-SD card holder at the bottom of the battery compartment.
# Unlock the SIM card holder by sliding the metal clip down, towards the USB socket, with your fingernail. Use caution, as these parts are delicate and could be damaged by forcing them in the wrong direction.
# Lift up on the SIM card holder.
# The Micro-SD card holder is held in place by a latch on either side.  It is easiest to open the Micro-SD card holder by releasing these latches one at a time rather than by lifting from the middle, as lifting from the middle tends to increase the latching pressure.  A small screwdriver or knife can be used for this.
# Insert the Micro-SD card into the Micro-SD card holder. Note that on the inside of metal part of the holder there are little holding tabs for the card. Slide the card in these holders (on the metal part) before closing the card holder. Note that the electrical contacts should face down and towards the edge of the Neo Freerunner.
# Close the Micro-SD card holder, making sure that both latches of the holder are securely fastened.
# Insert the SIM card into the SIM card holder, taking care to slide inside the two metal tabs in the cover. Note that the electrical contacts should face down and that the cut corner should be closest to the external GPS Antenna Socket.
# Close the SIM card holder and lock it by sliding the metal clip towards the external GPS Antenna Socket on the FreeRunner.
# Insert the battery into the battery compartment, aligning the electrical contacts on the battery with the electrical contacts in the battery compartment.  Insert the side with the electrical contacts first.
# Replace the rear cover on the FreeRunner.

===Charging the Neo Freerunner===

When using the Neo Freerunner for the first time, you should charge the battery completely. The battery can be charged using the provided charger (at 1000mA) or from a powered USB port capable of providing 500mA worth of current.  Most computers will be able to charge the FreeRunner without any problems.

Charging an empty battery at 100mA takes 12~15 hours, at 500mA takes 2,5~3,5 hours, and at 1000mA takes 1.5~2.5 hours. (90%~100%) [to be confirmed]

===Buttons and connectors===

===Unlocking the screen===

When the screen is locked, you should see a Matrix-style green graphic with the Openmoko symbol in the middle of the bottom of the screen along with lock and unlock symbols.  If you drag the Openmoko symbol to the unlock symbol at the top then the screen will become unlocked.

== Making your first phone call: Menus and Applications ==

''Note:'' this section describes the interface used by the "2007.2" image, which is the current default image for Openmoko.

====Today Page====
<!-- [[Image:Todaypage_reduced_false.png|right|200px|]] -->
The first thing after you boot Openmoko should be the "Today" page.  This is your home page.  In the top row, you see icons that indicate the status of the phone.  The second row are quick links to commonly-used applications such as the dialer.  The main body of the screen is your home page, displaying a clock and other useful information.  The bottom row consists of three tabs representing Today (the page you're viewing now), Launch Task Page, and Running Tasks Page.

See [[Today/2007.2]] for more information about the Today page and customization.<br clear=all />

====Launch Task Page====

{{stub}}

This page displays a menu of available applications.  You may choose a category of applications to display to simplify the screen, or choose to display them all.

Current categories are [[PIM Suite]], [[Applications]], [[Games]], [[Utilities]], and All.

====Running Tasks Page====

{{stub}}

This page displays currently-running tasks.  Any individual task may be terminated by selecting it and then clicking on the garbage-can icon to close it.  All tasks may be terminated by clicking on any one of them and then clicking on the "folder" icon in the upper right (expect this to change in future releases).  Any task may be rejoined by selecting it and then selecting the "return" icon at the middle top.

====Exiting an Application====

Any time an application is running, you can simply click the device's power button and the application will exit, returning you to the Today page.

Alternatively, you can switch tasks at any time by clicking the menu of tasks at the far upper-left of the screen, which will display a list of running tasks, allowing you to select one.

(''Note:'' If the task menu is not shown, use the [[#Aux|Aux]] button to bring up the Aux menu, and select "Toggle Fullscreen".)

===Adjusting the Volume===

As of this writing, there is no way to adjust the volume from the screen.

For now, run the terminal application or [[Getting_Started_with_your_Neo_FreeRunner#Connect_to_the_Neo_FreeRunner_By_USB_Networking|log in via usb]], and run the [[alsamixer]] application.  The mixer is simpler than it looks.  Just use the left and right arrow keys to select "headphone" or "PCM" and use the up and down arrow keys to adjust the volume.  You can also adjust your microphone volume with the "mic2" adjustment.  Press ESC when finished.  Then exit the terminal application or log out of the USB login.

You may need to update configuration files in /usr/share/openmoko/scenarios/ to make the microphone setting permanent.  Use
 alsactl -f ''path-to-statefile'' store
to do this.

The default files are as follows (in /usr/share/openmoko/scenarios/): 
:gsmhandset.state
:gsmheadset.state
:gsmspeakerout.state
:headset.state
:stereoout.state

These correspond to the various Sound Profiles accessible in the Debug Tool under Applications.

One way to increase the volume of the microphone is to do the following:
# ssh into your Freerunner
# vi /usr/share/openmoko/scenarios/gsmhandset.state
# search for "Mic2"
# change to "value 3"
[[Freerunner_Hardware_Issues]]

==Getting into your new Linux box==

===Connect with and log in the Neo FreeRunner===

Connect the Neo FreeRunner to your Linux computer using the standard mini-USB to USB cable provided.

With the device connected, modprobe usbnet module (if necessary) and configure usb0 interface (as root):
<pre>
ifconfig usb0 192.168.0.200 netmask 255.255.255.0
</pre>
If your eth0 interface is also in the same 'range' (e.g. 192.168.0.105) then you can do the following:

1. ping the Neo with
 # ping -I usb0 192.168.0.202
2. add a route to your Neo (adjust your firewall if necessary):
 # /sbin/route add -host 192.168.0.202/32 dev usb0
3 log in to the Neo with empty password
 # ssh root@192.168.0.202

You will eventually want to setup your computer so that it automatically connects the Neo FreeRunner to the Internet when it is plugged in. This is discussed in the [[USB_Networking]] section, which you should see if the procedure above fails.

===Use the package manager===

There are three layers to the software on the FreeRunner:

* uBoot: Think of u-boot as a combination of the BIOS and Grub on a PC.
* Kernel: The Linux kernel
* Root Filesystem: The rest of the system

In order to keep the FreeRunner up-to-date with the latest features and bug-fixes, it is advisable update the software at regular intervals. There are two main methods of doing this: using the package manager opkg (discussed in this section) or flashing (discussed section 7 below).

uboot, the kernel and the root filesystem can all be flashed to update them. For uboot, this is the only possibility. The advantage of flashing the kernel, rather than using opkg seems to be speed. The disadvantage of flashing the root file system is that it wipes out all local modifications, including /home. If /home is moved to the SD disk, this is no longer a problem.

Assuming that your FreeRunner can access the internet (see above), the kernel and other packages can be updated with

 # opkg update
 # opkg upgrade

The first updates the repository information, telling opkg what packages are available. The second upgrades all packages for which a newer version is available. '''At the moment, some signature files are missing (404 errors), which opkg complains about, but this is cosmetic.'''  The repositories will still update with the missing signature files.  

Note that running opkg upgrade on a factory-fresh phone will upgrade dropbear (the ssh software) and various xserver packages, and neither upgrades elegantly while in use, so either upgrade dropbear from the FreeRunner's terminal and then upgrade the rest via ssh, or upgrade the xserver packages via ssh and then upgrade the rest from the FreeRunner's terminal.  For example, go to the FreeRunner terminal and type:

 # opkg install dropbear

which will upgrade it to the latest version.  Then connect to the FreeRunner via ssh and type:

 # opkg upgrade

If you do your first upgrade in two installments like this, it will go more smoothly.

It will be possible in the future to update uboot with opkg, but this has not yet been implemented

=== Installing multimedia, web browsing and other applications ===

The calendar can be installed with

 # opkg install openmoko-dates2

For a Media Player:

 # opkg install openmoko-mediaplayer2
 # wget http://abraxa.dyndns.org:81/random/openmoko-mediaplayer-theme.tar.bz2
 # tar xjf openmoko-mediaplayer-theme.tar.bz2 -C /usr/share/themes/Moko/gtk-2.0
 # rm openmoko-mediaplayer-theme.tar.bz2

If you want a basic image viewer, have a look at the one from the gpe suite:

 # opkg install gpe-icons gpe-gallery

To obtain the standard web browser, use:

 # opkg install openmoko-browser2

An alternative browser, minimo, offers many more features.  
First download and unpack it on your GNU/Linux host:

 # wget http://www.ginguppin.de/files/minimo.tar.bz2
 # tar jvxf minimo.tar.bz2

Copy it over to the FreeRunner:
 # scp minimo_* root@openmoko:/tmp

Then on the FreeRunner:
 # opkg install /tmp/minimo_0.02\+cvs20070626-r0_armv4t.ipk

There are tons more apps you can install - check out the [[Repositories]] for a list of packages.

=== Accessing the microSD card ===

Mounted at /media/card by default.

If you have multiple partitions on the card, the first (/dev/mmcblk0p1) will be mounted at /media/card, the second at /media/mmcblk0p2, the third at /media/mmcblk0p3 etc.

=== Importing contacts ===

If you can export your contacts to VCard format, either multiple files or single file containing all of them, you may use the script on [[Import Vcf Contacts]] page to bring them to Neo.

==The next steps==

Congratulations for setting up your Neo FreeRunner. There are many more ressources to help free your phone: 

===Discovering advanced smartphone functions===

The stock [[Openmoko2007.2]] image flashed onto the Neo FreeRunner is really just the bare bones. For example, you don't have the clock and the quick-launch icons showing. Here's how you can change that:

 # dbus-launch gconftool-2 -t boolean -s /desktop/poky/interface/reduced false
 # /etc/init.d/xserver-nodm restart

If you rather have a regular clock instead of the digital one, do this instead:

 # dbus-launch gconftool-2 -t boolean -s /desktop/poky/interface/reduced false
 # dbus-launch gconftool-2 -t boolean -s /desktop/poky/interface/digital_clock false
 # /etc/init.d/xserver-nodm restart

More information about today screen customization at [[Today/2007.2]].

With either clock, you may wish to set the correct [[Date]] and [[Timezone]].

Also, if you prefer having a full keyboard, see [http://www.ginguppin.de/node/15 these instructions].

===GPS, GPRS and WLAN===

See [[GTA02 WLAN]] about wifi and [[Manually using GPRS]]. 

Simple guide to get going with GPS:

 # opkg install gpsd
 # echo "GPS_DEV=\"/dev/ttySAC1\"" > /etc/default/gpsd

and restart gpsd, the gps daemon, with

 # /etc/init.d/gpsd restart

To test GPS, you can use agpsui:

 # opkg install openmoko-agpsui

For a nice map, try tangoGPS:

 # opkg install http://www.tangogps.org/downloads/tangogps_0.9.2-r1_armv4t.ipk

More information on [[GPS]] page.

According to some [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/support/2008-July/000003.html posts], GPRS might be broken currently (2007.2), though. There are also critical [[GPS Problems]]. To install the updates when they become available, you will probably want to learn about [[Booting the Neo FreeRunner]] and [[Flashing the Neo FreeRunner]].
