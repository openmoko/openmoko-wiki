This guide will cover modifying the main screen of the [[Om_2008.8]] distribution and related ([[FDOM]] etc).

{{Todo|Merge with [[Customize Application Icons]]. [[User:MinhHaDuong|MinhHaDuong]] 07:31, 27 October 2008 (UTC)}}

==Home screen==
===Modifying===
Icon files are located under /usr/share/pixmaps.

.png extension is assumed

Any .desktop file placed in /usr/share/applications will appear on the home screen.

Example:
[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=INSTALLER
TryExec=assassin
GenericName=Installer
Comment=Assassin Openmoko Installer
StartupNotify=false
Exec=assassin
Icon=assassin
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=PackageManager;System;Settings;Bar;

===Set icons to appear in the low menu===
In the above example, 'Bar;' indicates that the item will appear in the bottom menu where 'INSTALLER' sits as default. Add 'Bar;' to 'Categories' for it to appear here.
