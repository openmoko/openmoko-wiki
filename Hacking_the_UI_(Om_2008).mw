This guide will cover modifying the main screen of the [[Om_2008.8]] distribution and related ([[FDOM]] etc). 

==Home screen==
===Modifying===
Icon files are located under /usr/share/applications. Any .desktop file placed here will appear on the home screen. 

Example:
 [Desktop Entry]
 Encoding=UTF-8
 Name=INSTALLER
 TryExec=assassin
 GenericName=Installer
 Comment=Assassin Openmoko Installer
 StartupNotify=false
 Exec=assassin
 Icon=assassin
 Terminal=false
 Type=Application
 Categories=PackageManager;System;Settings;Bar;

===Set icons to appear in the low menu===
In the above example, 'Bar;' indicates that the item will appear in the bottom menu where 'INSTALLER' sits as default. Add 'Bar;' to 'Categories' for it to appear here.
