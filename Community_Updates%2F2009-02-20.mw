* [[Fyp]] is a Debian for Freerunner based distribution which uses [http://lxde.org/ LXDE] and [[Zhone]] on top. It is a FreeYourPhone.de community project. Now the first beta image is released.

*[[Momtools]] - (momtools = MyOpenMoko tools) the idea of this tool is creating an easy-to-use application, allowing the freerunner (gta-02) to connect to wifi and gprs, and add some useful applications such as a slim media-player and a little accelerometers-game.  This project now is on progress. You can check this on it's wiki page.

*[[Enscribi]] - a new handwriting recognition input method, currently it only supports writing Japanese and Chinese characters. You can download ipk files and install it on FSO.

== Trick and Tips  ==

* MokoGeocaching Installing - After you install MokoGeocaching, if the app won't even start, you may need to install these dependencies manually (Om2008.12):
 opkg install python-netclient python-mime python-netclient

* How to search bugs real quick, instead of using trac.openmoko.org ? You can use the [http://lindi.iki.fi/lindi/cgi-bin/openmoko-bugs.py Unofficial search of bugs.openmoko.org]. You can type the keyword or bug number on text box, then press "search", the results will be listed below the text box.

==Community ==
* Openmoko autobuilder is back online. It is generating images for gta01 and gta02 devices. You can check images status on this site : http://tinderbox.openembedded.net/builders/openmoko/. Unstable images will auto generate in http://downloads.openmoko.org/repository/unstable/. There are some packages that are failing consistently, Openmoko distribution maintainer is going to try and debug these and send some fixes upstream.

* Openmoko started migrating content from the Om wiki to [http://en.flossmanuals.net/bin/view/NeoFreeRunner/WebHome FLOSS Manuals]. Basis for the manual will be derived from [[Getting_Started_with_your_Neo_FreeRunner|Getting Started With Your Neo FreeRunner]] and [[Openmoko_developer_guide|Openmoko Developer Guide]].

* Wiki news! As per [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/documentation/2009-February/001079.html documentation mailing list] justification, I reverted my previous revert of main page. People missing the old multitude of links should look at the improved left side navigation choices. I also combined "Openmoko:Community Portal" into "Development resources" and renamed the whole thing to "[[Community Resources]]". -[[User:TimoJyrinki|Timo]]
