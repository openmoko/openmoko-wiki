== The device signals when it is dropped ==

When the accelerometer detects that the device is in freefall, it
generates the sound of a bloodcurling scream.

And maybe says "ouch" if there is a subsequent large impact.  Possibly also keeps murmuring "I'm over here!" if it detects that no one is picking it up.  (And "Thanks" when it does get picked up.)

=Utility=

This will help me know when my phone has fallen out of my pocket/clip.  It can also lock
the device after a fall, in case someone unfriendly picks it up (and displays an owner message).

That also brings up the interesting screen-lock method of throwing it up in the air.

=Problems=

Continual use of accelerometer hardware.  Could be embarrassing.
