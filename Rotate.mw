{{Languages|Rotate}}

Here's a quick and simple C program that reads a packet from the
accelerometer once per second, and rotates the screen to a new
orientation if the orientation has changed.

I don't mean this to conflict with Paul's excellent work on [[Gestures]];
my reason for writing it is so that it can be used as an always-on
daemon in the OM distributions.  (Full gesture interpretation is more
CPU heavy and requires reading data more often than once per second,
so perhaps that will be done on-demand instead of always-on.)

The code is:

There's an ARM binary here (chmod a+x rotate && ./rotate):
