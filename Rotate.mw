{{Application|Rotate}}

Here's a quick and simple C program that reads a packet from the
accelerometer once per second, and rotates the screen to a new
orientation if the orientation has changed.           

I don't mean this to conflict with Paul's excellent work on [[Gestures]];
my reason for writing it is so that it can be used as an always-on
daemon in the OM distributions.  (Full gesture interpretation is more
CPU heavy and requires reading data more often than once per second,
so perhaps that will be done on-demand instead of always-on.)

The code is:
   http://github.com/cjb/freerunner-rotate/tree/master/rotate.c?raw=true

There's an ARM binary here (chmod a+x rotate && ./rotate):
   http://dev.laptop.org/~cjb/rotate

And you're welcome to make patches against the GIT repo here:
   git://github.com/cjb/freerunner-rotate.git

Would anyone else be interested in being the maintainer of this package?
It would involve packaging it up in bitbake/OE and trying to persuade
the various OM distros to include it by default.  (Perhaps with an
on/off control panel entry in distros that make that easy to do?)

Comments appreciated.  Thanks!

- Chris.
