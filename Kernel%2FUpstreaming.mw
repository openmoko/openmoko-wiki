 lindi: openmoko specific. relatively simple, real trouble is in the glamo driver itself
= [https://gitorious.org/shr/linux/commit/cf18c7ef4b91239ff51929d60173afa26627ba51?format=patch <nowiki>Add jbt device.</nowiki>] =

 lindi: trivial. why does AR6003 define this in drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath6kl/hif.h and not this common file?
= [https://gitorious.org/shr/linux/commit/81c7116b8418aa499ebea9755fc586e8bfc6d91e?format=patch <nowiki>Add ar6000 wireless driver.</nowiki>] =
 lindi: tricky! probably can never be mainlined. Maybe we can build it as a separate module package in debian?

 From #ath6kl on freenode:
 <pabs3> kvalo: does ath6kl support AR6001/AR6002?
 <kvalo> pabs3: no
 <pabs3> kvalo: do you think it is feasible to add support for them, or are they completely different?
 <kvalo> pabs3: I haven't even seen either of them so I'm not qualified to answer :)
 <pabs3> ok

= [https://gitorious.org/shr/linux/commit/4e11662e7b95b1a8cdee1f5af9dc5ec49ce3c129?format=patch <nowiki>Add jbt6k74 display driver.</nowiki>] =
 lindi: feature. quite essential. does not look too tricky.
= [https://gitorious.org/shr/linux/commit/82dfe46f68342b3139b4df33cf3f782ab6d52dd9?format=patch <nowiki>LEDS: leds-pwm: Add init, notfiy and exit callbacks</nowiki>] =
 lindi: feature. not sure how easy this is to mainline

 lindi: safe cleanup?
= [https://gitorious.org/shr/linux/commit/0a304203ac7daf36070f8fecd8974bfaf84d9df6?format=patch <nowiki>pcf50633-gpio: Add gpiolib support.</nowiki>] =
 lindi: feature. has some useless whitespace changes. gpio stuff which I don't really understand
= [https://gitorious.org/shr/linux/commit/22ce0c31d823e002859fe5ef50f17905ce90471b?format=patch <nowiki>pcf50633: Move pcf50633-gpio driver to the gpio drivers folder</nowiki>] =
 lindi: just moves a file
= [https://gitorious.org/shr/linux/commit/e583591037796f962d07e935b2a1bdd0f89a61fb?format=patch <nowiki>MFD: pcf50633: Use mfd cells to register 
child devices</nowiki>] =
 lindi: cleanup? No idea how tricky this really is
= [https://gitorious.org/shr/linux/commit/780da55e2ad7f9d934e7452fba4340a5f9575a32?format=patch <nowiki>MFD: pcf50633: Use the genirq for irq handling</nowiki>] =
 lindi: has again extra whitespace changes. I guess genirq is some more abstract way to handle IRQs? Can not really judge how tricky this is.
= [https://gitorious.org/shr/linux/commit/3e77986a22550a8df84d9e78ddbc281488bf1120?format=patch <nowiki>power: implement platform battery driver</nowiki>] =
 lindi: feature. we can live without this if bq27x00 is mainlined or vice versa.
= [https://gitorious.org/shr/linux/commit/d09e21824bacd5f9ac0285c14c6ddc2d79b96608?format=patch <nowiki>Define machine_is_neo1973_gta01()</nowiki>] =
 lindi: trivial

 lindi: glamo stuff, no idea
= [https://gitorious.org/shr/linux/commit/833339cd47295e86e0ca8c838e8997a24ababf6c?format=patch <nowiki>nand/s3c2410: add mising badblocksbits value</nowiki>] =
 lindi: bugfix. trivial. 
 lindi: it seems this was broken in 2.6.36 and fixed again in 3.0.0 but differently: 26d9be11485ea8c1102c3e8eaa7667412eef4950
= [https://gitorious.org/shr/linux/commit/919ad8a33847d10bb2b6b4f9bb24702346455f1f?format=patch <nowiki>Openmoko resume reason sysfs node ported from 2.6.29</nowiki>] =
 lindi: feature. I personally need this a lot so that I can differentiate between RTC and GSM wakeups
= [https://gitorious.org/shr/linux/commit/dd73aa36cb4d37d200aead95310df58cfec784d3?format=patch <nowiki>glamo-display: fix WSOD for 242 timming</nowiki>] =
 lindi: openmoko specific. glamo hack. Who said 2-4-2 timings have no drawbacks? ;-)
gena2x: This is not original name for patch! And not true. I do not know why radek maned it with this way, but actually it JUST fixes WSOD with all kind of timings. Please rename it.

= [https://gitorious.org/shr/linux/commit/5c7e36859e8e28f9b56a2cb3ceb0ab2c3d079f96?format=patch <nowiki>Enable powering off after 8s POWER press</nowiki>] =
 lindi: openmoko specific. feature. simple. I personally don't really like this much however this should be easy to upstream.
= [https://gitorious.org/shr/linux/commit/ba207d46b7857f6cae1368f0e62e611eb773505c?format=patch <nowiki>gta02: add support for usb host mode</nowiki>] =
 lindi: openmoko specific feature. looks quite simple.
= [https://gitorious.org/shr/linux/commit/3066c8798168cb31af999e9d55bca2b445e27cdb?format=patch <nowiki>ar6000_delay.patch</nowiki>] =
 lindi: atheros wifi hack
= [https://gitorious.org/shr/linux/commit/b3f60f3ed24f503bda64aabf94b62053379c9ca9?format=patch <nowiki>wm8753: use snd_soc_jack on neo1973</nowiki>] =
 lindi: openmoko specific. gta01-only?
= [https://gitorious.org/shr/linux/commit/d5d5ee9c07ee06174f06255ae3141c368ca48f6a?format=patch <nowiki>Fix high power consumption in suspend</nowiki>] =
 lindi: openmoko specific. bugfix. simple. this should be a good candidate for upstreaming first?
= [https://gitorious.org/shr/linux/commit/084e5cd3284d499e3c4eb86f26042e7d72df2266?format=patch <nowiki>Force GPS power up on resume if it were powered up on suspend</nowiki>] =
 lindi: openmoko specific. Is this needed at all with qi? (My guess is no, its resume path does not touch serial ports)
= [https://gitorious.org/shr/linux/commit/edcc8410bc93dcc06b69d57e8b7b47756124cd1e?format=patch <nowiki>lis302dl accelerometer driver</nowiki>] =
 lindi: openmoko specific. feature. hard to say how tricky this is. I can personally live without accelerometers.
 Paul: upstream has a different driver for the hardware: http://lwn.net/Articles/304326/
= [https://gitorious.org/shr/linux/commit/02e9ff6da8f66701739b5beac43200eb3e0acbd7?format=patch <nowiki>input: lis302dl: fix the resume path</nowiki>] =
 lindi: openmoko specific. bugfix to accelerometer support.
= [https://gitorious.org/shr/linux/commit/10b4b78dc2081caff1239f229e08a7e829ed3c7d?format=patch <nowiki>lis302dl: use ABS events rather then REL events</nowiki>] =
 lindi: openmoko specific. bugfix to accelerometer support.
= [https://gitorious.org/shr/linux/commit/9668f02fe2af9dd880d5f83f95bd07bb2d963c56?format=patch <nowiki>Fix compile error for gta02 accelerometer.</nowiki>] =
 lindi: openmoko specific. trivial bugfix to accelerometer support. Why not rebase this to the patch?
= [https://gitorious.org/shr/linux/commit/f0e6a6317de2567383a543a545cf50e58b3caa3d?format=patch <nowiki>tslib relies on ts pressures events so this hack is needed to get tslib stuff working</nowiki>] =
 lindi: s3c specific. hack? I personally can live with evdev if this really only affects tslib.
 Paul: hm, worth investigating more: is not returning pressure at all a valid thing to do for a TS driver?
= [https://gitorious.org/shr/linux/commit/b05f074d5eb6f77cefcef35f7f2b2aaeb27af069?format=patch <nowiki>touchscreen: ignore unexpected interrupts</nowiki>] =
 lindi: s3c specific. bugfix? hard to say how ready this is for mainlining.
= [https://gitorious.org/shr/linux/commit/1f3750e2cf3895b269589495147416c61ba523c5?format=patch <nowiki>s3c2410_ts: jitter less touchscreen for glamo, version 4</nowiki>] =
 lindi: openmoko specific. quite essential. hack: read ts during vblank?
 gena2x: it slows down pixclock to read jitterless data. it does that while blank so screen has no artefacts. may be it is possible to do that while blank without slowing pixclock, even that we have no VSYNC-like interrupt we should be able to calculate exact time of VSYNC because pixclock is constant and we always know current position. But this doesn't solve only major concern of this patch - it introduces link (via callbacks) between glamo and ts.

= [https://gitorious.org/shr/linux/commit/74c481b35be9bf9b7d512de6942c7be345a7db47?format=patch <nowiki>wm8753: allow setting DAI mode even while pcm is active</nowiki>] =
 lindi: bugfix. should be easy to mainline. This basically fixes a bug introduced in 338ee25393a5627e8ded5819147f98b919656ce9 that was mainlined to 2.6.39
 lindi: is there some other driver that needs a similar fix? tlv320dac33.c seems to have a similar if (dac33->fifo_mode == ucontrol->value.integer.value[0]) return 0;
 lindi: why does this return 1?
 lindi/TODO: rebase on top of dev branch of git://opensource.wolfsonmicro.com/linux-2.6-asoc
 lindi/TODO: git send-email to http://mailman.alsa-project.org/mailman/listinfo/alsa-devel

= [https://gitorious.org/shr/linux/commit/4f1ae92f97c4aaad16567a5101c8b668893a9c91?format=patch <nowiki>Workaround toolchain bug: http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48783</nowiki>] =
 lindi: trivial. Occurs with gcc 4.4 but not 4.6 anymore. No need to mainline :-)
= [https://gitorious.org/shr/linux/commit/098ed461036a5d9ba027b62c18a85622a055f63d?format=patch <nowiki>First attempt at fixing openmoko bug #2478</nowiki>] =
 lindi: openmoko specific. bugfix. not yet ready. See http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/2478
