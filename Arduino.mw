=== Description ===

Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for artists, designers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments.

Arduino can sense the environment by receiving input from a variety of sensors and can affect its surroundings by controlling lights, motors, and other actuators. The microcontroller on the board is programmed using the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring) and the Arduino development environment (based on Processing). Arduino projects can be stand-alone or they can communicate with software on running on a computer (e.g. Flash, Processing, MaxMSP).

== Connection to Neo via USB ==

To connect Neo to Arduino you need a cable with "usb mini-b" for the Neo and "usb b-type" for the Arduino.

To send voltage to the Arduino and to make Neo host of usb devices:
<pre>
echo "1" > /sys/devices/platform/neo1973-pm-host.0/hostmode
echo "host" > /sys/devices/platform/s3c2410-ohci/usb_mode
</pre>

== Comunication ==

I have create a new project in http://projects.openmoko.org/projects/mokardu/ for colaborate.

The name is MokArdu ( Moko + Arudino ).
