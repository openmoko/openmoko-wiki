'''Status:''' ''[http://opensvn.csie.org/fyp/releases/5/ release 5.3 is ready]''

= Concept =
The main concept is the use of [http://lxde.org/ LXDE] and [[Zhone]] which is embedded in the background and the whole is based on Debian/FSO as a subsystem.

* Zhemes, an application to switch between four [[Zhone]] themes
* preinstalled applications (Woosh, [[Pidgin]], [[TangoGPS]], Wifi-Radar, EpdfView, Mokomaze, [[CellHunter]])

= Installation =

== Recommendations ==
