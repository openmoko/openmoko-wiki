{{Languages|fyp}}

fyp is a Debian for Freerunner based [[Distributions|distribution]] which uses LXDE and Zhone on top. It is a FreeYourPhone.de community project. 

'''Status:''' ''first beta image is released''

= Concept =
The main concept is the use of LXDE and Zhone which is embedded in the background and the whole is based on Debian/FSO as a subsystem.
This will allow the user to use the basic functions of the phone in a fingerfriendly way, but also gives the opportunity to take the pen and go surfing the web or do some messaging.

= Features =
* a new Zhone theme
* preinstalled applications (Iceweasel, Pidgin, TangoGPS, Wicd)
* it fits on the 256MB NAND flash


= Installation =

Get the jffs2 image and the kernel given and flash it to your Freerunner.

* Power (short press) pops up the shutdown/suspend menu 

== Recommendations ==

* make and use a swapfile in your µsd (warning: this may destroy the µsd card after uncertain time)
* save the TangoGPS map files on the µsd as there is little space left on the NAND
