neovento is a [[Debian|Debian for Freerunner]] based [[Distributions|distribution]] which uses [http://lxde.org/ LXDE] and [[Zhone]] on top. It is a [http://freeyourphone.de FreeYourPhone.de] community project. 

'''Status:''' ''[http://opensvn.csie.org/fyp/releases/3.18/ release 3.18 is ready]''

= Concept =
The main concept is the use of [http://lxde.org/ LXDE] and [[Zhone]] which is embedded in the background and the whole is based on Debian/FSO as a subsystem.
This distribution has the aim not only to be fully finger friendly, but also to give you a full featured desktop environment.

= Features =
* completely fingerfriendly
* window based environment
* a new [[Zhone]] theme
* preinstalled applications (Fennec/Lynx, [[Pidgin]], [[TangoGPS]], Wifi-Radar, EpdfView, Mokomaze, [[CellHunter]])
* it fits on the 256MB NAND flash

= Installation =

* download latest [http://opensvn.csie.org/fyp/releases/ release]
* flash the image and the kernel with [[NeoTool|NeoTool]]
* optional: make use of the latest [http://opensvn.csie.org/fyp/patches patch]

= Usage =

== Buttons ==

* AUX (short press) shows the keyboard
* Power (short press) suspends the Neo

== Recommendations ==

* use the recommended Kernel
* make and use a [[SwapSpace|swapfile]] on your µSD (warning: this may destroy the µSD card after uncertain time)
* save the TangoGPS map files on the µSD as there is little space left on the NAND

= To-Do =

Please help in contributing Neovento changes back to Debian. It does not help the big picture to do just concentrate on images and scripts if the base work in Debian does not improve - the development in the long run suffers.

* Contribute packaging to [http://wiki.debian.org/Teams/DebianFSO pkg-fso] team for any packages not yet in the repositories (already in Debian or Debian's PKG-FSO: Pidgin, mokomaze, tangogps, epdfview)
** Fennec
** Wifi-radar
** Mokomaze
* Contribute changes to Debian or upstream repositories
** Zhone
** LXDE (eg. lxde-fso package with settings)
** Matchbox
* Create for example "fso-neoventa" meta package for PKG-FSO repositories, installation of which equals to installing Neovento image

Note that especially contributing to Debian-FSO team's work is not that hard, and not all requirements of official Debian apply there.
