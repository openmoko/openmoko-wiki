'''Status:''' ''[http://opensvn.csie.org/fyp/releases/3.18/ release 3.18 is ready]''

= Concept =
The main concept is the use of [http://lxde.org/ LXDE] and [[Zhone]] which is embedded in the background and the whole is based on Debian/FSO as a subsystem.

* a new [[Zhone]] theme

* optional: make use of the latest [http://opensvn.csie.org/fyp/patches patch]

= Usage =

== Recommendations ==
