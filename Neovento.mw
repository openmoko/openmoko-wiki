== fyp - the FreeYourPhone distribution ==


The main concept is the use of LXDE and Zhone which is embedded in the background and the whole is based on Debian/FSO as a subsystem.
This will allow you to use the basic functions of the phone in a fingerfriendly way, but also gives the opportunity to take the pen and go surfing the web or do some messaging.

Further features are the beautiful new zhone theme and some important preinstalled applications and also preconfigurations.
It includes a full lxde environment, Zhone, Wicd, Iceweasel, Pidgin and some more.

This all fits in one jffs2 image for your 256MB NAND flash.

The aim for this distribution is to make it pretty simple and simply pretty.

It is recommended to use the Kernel given in the release path, to use a swapfile for speed improvement and not to save the tangogps files on the NAND which is short of space.
