'''Status:''' ''[http://opensvn.csie.org/fyp/releases/2.17/ second beta image (2.17) is released]''

The main concept is the use of [http://lxde.org/ LXDE] and [[Zhone]] which is embedded in the background and the whole is based on Debian/FSO as a subsystem.
This will allow the user to use the basic functions of the phone in a fingerfriendly way, but also gives the opportunity to take the pen and go surfing the web or do some messaging.
