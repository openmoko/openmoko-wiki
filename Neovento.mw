'''Status:''' ''[http://opensvn.csie.org/fyp/releases/2.17/ second beta image (2.17) is released]''

= Concept =
The main concept is the use of [http://lxde.org/ LXDE] and [[Zhone]] which is embedded in the background and the whole is based on Debian/FSO as a subsystem.
This distribution has the aim not only to be fully finger friendly, but also to give you a full featured desktop environment.

* a new Zhone theme
* preinstalled applications (Dillo, Pidgin, TangoGPS, Wifi-Radar, EpdfView, Mokomaze, Cellhunter)

= Installation =

* optional: make use of the latest [http://opensvn.csie.org/fyp/patches patch]

= Usage =

== Recommendations ==

* use the recommended Kernel
* make and use a [[SwapSpace|swapfile]] on your µSD (warning: this may destroy the µSD card after uncertain time)
* save the TangoGPS map files on the µSD as there is little space left on the NAND
* Uboot stable is recommended in case you want to be sure to have everything functional
