== Purpose ==

dfu-util is a program that implements the Host (PC) side of the [[USB DFU]] (Universal Serial Bus Device Firmware Upgrade) protocol.

In the OpenMoko project, we use this program to communicate with our specially enhanced [[u-boot]] boot loader, which implements the DFU device side.

Using dfu-util and your Neo1973, you can
* transfer and flash partitions to [[NAND Flash]], such as 
** The Linux [[kernel]]
** The root file system partition
** The splash screen partition
** The u-boot environment
** Last, but not least: The [[u-boot]] bootloader itself.
* transfer anything into Neo1973 RAM
** this can be used for fast development cycles of low-level code such as kernels without flashing them
* read out the current NAND partitions
** this is an easy and efficient way of doing full backups of your phone

== Phrasebook ==

There's no full-fledged manual yet.  Instead, some examples:

=== Flashing the kernel ===

 dfu-util -a 3 -t 4093 -D /path/to/uImage

=== Flashing the bootloader ===

 dfu-util -a 1 -t 4093 -D /path/to/u-boot.bin

=== Copying a kernel into RAM ===

 dfu-util -a 0 -t 4093 -D /path/to/uImage

Once this has finished, the kernel will be available at the default load address of 0x32000000 in Neo1973 RAM. 

{{note|You cannot transfer more than 2MB of data into RAM using this method}}
