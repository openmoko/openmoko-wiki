== Change matchbox keyboard layout ==

If you have the matchbox-keyboard installed you can change the layout.
In /usr/share/matchbox-keyboard/ are the keyboard-files in xml format
just take one an copy it to your home-directory

 mkdir /home/root/.matchbox
 cp /usr/share/matchbox-keyboard/keyboard.xml /home/root/.matchbox/

so now you can change the layout of the keyboard by changing this file
you could add also more than one layout in that file and you can change this on-the-fly by using
this button on your keyboard [->]

for example here is my keyboard.xml with german QWERTZ layout, numblock layout and default layout
just copy it to your home directory, rename it to keyboard.xml and have fun
