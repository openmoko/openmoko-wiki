'''phoned''' will be a replacement for [[neod]]. the aux menu, power menu and display locking functinality will be outsourced in normal applications. '''phoned''' will send all sort of phone events through dbus, e.g.

* aux button pressed/released
* power button pressed/released
* earphone plugged in/out
* earphone button pressed/released
* timeouts (no user interactions since X seconds, ...)

The architecture will be similar to the architecture of blueZ.

Please contact "borg" in #openmoko or write an email to olaf@uni-paderborn.de if you want to help or have ideas for new events or other interfaces.

{{note|Before you start on something new, please consider helping us in the new [[http://www.vanille-media.de/site/index.php/2007/11/27/collaboration-launch-on-phoneserver-and-devicedaemon/ device daemon initiative]]. A lot of embedded Linux projects are in severe need of a need a small hardware daemon and I'd like us to collaborate on just _one_ that runs on Zaurus, iPaqs, HTCs, Palms, etc. :Mickey:}}
