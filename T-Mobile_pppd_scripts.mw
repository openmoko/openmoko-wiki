I got this working using wap.voicestream.com.  internet2 keeps giving me "LCP terminated by peer (^K!)" after CHAP auth.

Note to the above comment (2008-08-19 by Ryan Adams): I finally got internet2.voicestream.com working (on OM2008.8).  Initially, like the user above, I received "LCP terminated by peer (^K!)" after CHAP authentication.  It turns out this only happened when I dialed in to "99***2".  When I used "99***1" instead I was able to get all the way through without any errors.  I have the "T-Mobile Total Internet Add-on" plan and live around Seattle, WA.

This almost worked as is for me.  I simply had to remove the "115200" line.  I'm using T-Mobile in Denver, CO so I'm not sure if that's what caused the differences. - Dave

I was able to use "internet2.voicestream.com".  Once again, not sure if being in Denver caused the difference.  - Dave
