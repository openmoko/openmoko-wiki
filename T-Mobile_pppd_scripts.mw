I've seen some progress getting pppd working with T-Mobile again.  The files I'm using are below.

NOTE: This isn't working reliably for me yet.  It worked one time.  Now it hangs gsmd and fails to connect.  


== /etc/ppp/peers/tmobile ==
   /dev/ttySAC0
   115200
   defaultroute # set the default route
   usepeerdns
   crtscts 
   lock   
   noauth
   local 
     
   connect "/usr/sbin/chat -v -f /etc/ppp/chatscripts/tmobile"
   disconnect "/usr/sbin/chat -v -f /etc/ppp/chatscripts/tmobile-disconnect"
