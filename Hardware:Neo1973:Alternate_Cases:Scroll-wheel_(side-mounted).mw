Alternate case for the Neo1973, with side-mounted scroll-wheel

==Concept==
Ease navigation in menus and pages and setting of certain controls.

Please consider following positions for placing a scroll-wheel: top left, top right or bottom front

Also consider making the scroll-wheel 'pressable'.

Scroll-wheel (from old mouse?)
<br/>
There are some scroll wheel-type things in a lot of modern digital cameras that would suit the purpose. I think the scroll wheel from a mouse would be too "soft" for a portable device. [[User:Mmanjos|Mmanjos]] 20:23, 4 November 2007 (CET)

A touchpad-like scrolling area would probably take-up less space and would be more durable. --[[User:Beavel|Beavel]] 11:57, 22 April 2008 (CEST) (oh, sorry, such thing is here [[Hardware:Neo1973:Alternate Cases:Touch strip sensor (side-mounted)]]
