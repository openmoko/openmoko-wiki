Alternate case for the Neo1973, with side-mounted scroll-wheel

==Processes==
Stereolithography

==Components==
Scroll-wheel (from old mouse?)
<br/>
There are some scroll wheel-type things in a lot of modern digital cameras that would suit the purpose. I think the scroll wheel from a mouse would be too "soft" for a portable device. [[User:Mmanjos|Mmanjos]] 20:23, 4 November 2007 (CET)
