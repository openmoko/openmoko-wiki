====='''Period 2011-06-01 to 2011-08-31'''=====

Welcome to 2011-09-01 edition of the Openmoko Community Updates. Openmoko is a loosely bound group of people originating from the developers and users of the pioneering Neo1973 and Neo FreeRunner products from Openmoko Inc. Nowadays most efforts are around free software distributions for a range of mobile phones, including the original Neo products. There are also several spin-off companies inspired by the Openmoko Inc's work.

== Hardware ==

* Video of the [[Freerunner_Navigation_Board_v3]] production posted @ YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngyhKr3yTO8

* [http://projects.goldelico.com/p/gta04-main/ GTA04] has now several early adopter boards with UMTS and OMAP3 hardware functional. Stay tuned for this motherboard update to original Neo phones.

== Distributions ==

Distributions lists releases and other significant updates in distributions that have some support for the Openmoko devices. 

{{DistributionBox|
Name=Debian GNU/Linux |
Description=[[Debian]] is a universal operating system used on many embedded devices, servers and home computers. Using Debian on the FreeRunner gives access to the huge army of software packaged in the Debian repositories, already compiled for the Neo's ARM(v4) processor. Moreover, one can build one's own source files for programs without having to learn the OpenEmbedded way. For an existing Debian/Ubuntu user, choosing Debian for Neo FreeRunner makes phone a very familiar, trustworthy and flexible place to hack in.<br><br>
General news:
<br>
* Debian is again installable with the install.sh script, thanks to a new kernel and some testing. See http://wiki.debian.org/DebianOnFreeRunner for more details
* FreeSmartphone.Org's FSO2 is making it into Debian finally, thanks to fabulous work by Rico Rommel and others. Most of it is already in: http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-fso-maint/2011-August/004321.html
* FSO2 also means a start of support for many new phones like ''Palm Pre'', ''Nokia N900'', ''Nexus One'' and others that have at least some support in fso-deviced
* A new 2.6.34 kernel was released into the pkg-fso repository, required by all Neo FreeRunner users that have upgraded to Debian unstable's newest udev version. It includes the wire_up_sys_accept4.patch.
* Enlightenment 17 (E17) has seen several updates, but the Python bindings still lag behind and the needed versions are only available in the experimental repository
* omhacks 0.15 uploaded, most noticeable change: Fix error handling of om_sysfs_readfile
