The card works fine with the following kernel parameters here (GTA02 with GPS capacitor fix on uSD slot):

glamo_mci.sd_max_clk=10000000 glamo_mci.sd_drive=2

Lower drive strength or or higher clock speed cause unreliable behavior if the GSM modem is activated (either directly after entering the PIN, when making a call, or using GPRS):

Sep 15 14:15:20 debian-gta02 kernel: mmcblk0: error -84 sending read/write command

Sep 15 14:15:20 debian-gta02 kernel: glamo-mci glamo-mci.0: Error after cmd: 0x4304

Drive strength of 0 at glamo_mci.sd_max_clk=10000000 is pretty reliable at normal operation, but still fails sometimes when GPRS is activated.

(last verified using 2008.8 and newer daily kernel versions)
