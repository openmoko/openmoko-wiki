NOTE: This is work in progress and quite incomplete

=Features=

The FRIDB realizes an experimental platform for RFID (13.56 MHz). It consists of an Antenna, a ST Micro M24LR64 RFID-Tag Chip with EEPROM port and a Texas Instruments TRF7960 RFID reader chip with SPI interface.

So you can make the Freerunner either a RFID tag (e.g. to open doors) or a RFID reader (to read/write standard tags e.g. in credit card format).

The board comes with three parts that can/must be separated:
* Antenna
* RFID-Tag with I2C EEPROM (ST Micro M24LR64)
* RFID-Reader with SPI interface (TI TRF7960)

Either the Tag or the Reader module fits into the area above the SIM/SD card reader of the Openmoko Freerunner.
It is up to you to wire the board to the Freerunner main board in a way that you can still swap SD cards and/or SIM cards.

The FRIDB can also connected to other Microcontrollers and SoC (e.g BeagleBoard) since it has splitted I/O and power supply.

===Expansion pads===
The supply voltage as well as the SPI / I2C bus is routed to testpads at the end of the board.

=Documentation=
The project home is http://projects.goldelico.com/p/fridb/. There, you can find background information, instructions, software etc.

Schematic and board layout files are available in CadSoft EAGLE 5.x format from http://projects.goldelico.com/p/fridb/downloads/.

* '''VCC''': +3.3V, available at the AUX-Switch
* '''VIO''': +1.8 V - +3.3V, available at the AUX-Switch
* '''GND''': Ground, available from the (big) decoupling capacitor next to the accelerometer
* '''SCL''', '''SDA''': Serial clock and data, get it from testpoints at the debug connector
* '''OE''': Output enable from the frequency generator. Pull this pin high to enable the CLK output
* '''CLK''': Clock output from the frequency generator.
* '''LED controller 0-3''': LED current sinks. Connect LEDs in series with current limiting resistors from VCC to these pads.
* '''12-Bit A/D 0-3''': Analog to digital converter inputs. They can operate single ended or differencial. The reference voltage is VCC.
* '''Touch electrodes 0-6''': Connect these pads to a larger conducting area to use it as touch sensor. The inputs 0-3 can also be used to drive LEDs. Refer to the datasheet for more information.
