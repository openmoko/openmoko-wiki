NOTE: This is work in progress and quite incomplete

=Features=

The FRIDB realizes an experimental platform for RFID (13.56 MHz). It consists of an Antenna, a ST Micro M24LR64 RFID-Tag Chip with 64kbit EEPROM and I2C port and a Texas Instruments TRF7960 RFID reader chip with SPI interface.

So you can make the Freerunner either a RFID tag (e.g. to open doors) or a RFID reader (to read/write standard tags e.g. in credit card format).

The board comes with three parts that can/must be separated:
* Antenna
* RFID-Tag with I2C EEPROM (ST Micro M24LR64)
* RFID-Reader with SPI interface (TI TRF7960)

Either the Tag or the Reader module fits into the area above the SIM/SD card reader of the Openmoko Freerunner.
The antenna can be fixed by tape instead of the battery cover or mounted externaly.
It is up to you to wire the board to the Freerunner main board in a way that you can still swap SD cards and/or SIM cards.

The FRIDB can also connected to other Microcontrollers and SoC (e.g BeagleBoard) since it has splitted I/O and power supply.

===Expansion pads===
The supply voltage as well as the SPI / I2C bus is routed to testpads at the end of the board.

=Documentation=
The project home is http://projects.goldelico.com/p/fridb/. There, you can find background information, instructions, software etc.

Schematic and board layout files are available in CadSoft EAGLE 5.x format from http://projects.goldelico.com/p/fridb/downloads/.

* '''VCC''': +3.3V, available at the AUX-Switch
* '''VIO''': +1.8 V - +3.3V, available at the AUX-Switch
* '''GND''': Ground, available from the (big) decoupling capacitor next to the accelerometer
* '''SCL''', '''SDA''': Serial clock and data, get it from testpoints at the debug connector
* '''OE''': Output enable from the frequency generator. Pull this pin high to enable the CLK output
* '''CLK''': Clock output from the frequency generator.
* '''LED controller 0-3''': LED current sinks. Connect LEDs in series with current limiting resistors from VCC to these pads.
* '''12-Bit A/D 0-3''': Analog to digital converter inputs. They can operate single ended or differencial. The reference voltage is VCC.
* '''Touch electrodes 0-6''': Connect these pads to a larger conducting area to use it as touch sensor. The inputs 0-3 can also be used to drive LEDs. Refer to the datasheet for more information.

==Installation==
===Hardware installation===
The best way to connect the FRIDB to your Freerunner is to solder four wires to...

==Software==
===U-Boot driver===
some C-code for a U-Boot API is available to do some preliminary SPI communication (e.g. read/write registers).
Link: http://projects.goldelico.com/p/fridb/source/tree/master/u-boot

===Kernel drivers===
Upcoming.

===Userspace software===

n/a yet. Volunteers welcome!

What we most likely need is a Card scanner application (i.e. one that lists when tags come to vicinity).
And it would be nice to read/write content (which is unfortunately not quite standardized).

And we should have a keyboard driver that pressing the AUX button "types" the
ID of the current card plus a Newline. This would allow to use the card scanner like a
barcode scanner.
