Openmoko is still developing new phones. Each phone has an internal name before it's reaches it's final status. Here you can follow the development for nearby.

== GTA04 (future)==

The fourth Openmoko planned, GTA04, will be based on a different system-on-a-chip.

== GTA03 (future)==

The next phone, GTA03, will be based on the same system-on-a-chip as the Neo FreeRunner (GTA02). It will presumably differ from it by having a 3.5 mm TRS audio connector (instead of a 2.5 mm connector), EDGE and a camera. GTA03 will not include support for 3G networks.

== GTA02  (Neo FreeRunner)==
