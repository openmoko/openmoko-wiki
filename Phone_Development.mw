Openmoko is still developing new phones. Each phone has an internal name before it's reaches it's final status. Here you can follow the development for nearby.

== GTA04 (future)==

The fourth Openmoko planned, GTA04, will be based on a different system-on-a-chip.

== GTA03 (future)==

The next phone, GTA03, will be based on the same system-on-a-chip as the Neo FreeRunner (GTA02). It will presumably differ from it by having a 3.5 mm TRS audio connector (instead of a 2.5 mm connector), EDGE and a camera. GTA03 will not include support for 3G networks.

The Neo Base costed $300, with the Advanced kit costing  $450.
Both have now sold out.

See [[Neo 1973 hardware#GTA01Bv4|Neo 1973 hardware]] for what components GTA01B_v04 contains.

Neo Base -- everything the mobile application developer needs to enjoy
the benefits of the first freed phone, the Neo 1973:

 * Neo 1973 (GTA01B_v4)
 * Battery (1200mAh)
 * Stylus
 * Headset
 * Phone Pouch
 * Lanyard
 * SanDisk 512MB MicroSD Card
 * Mini USB Connectivity Cable

Neo Advanced -- everything the mobile device hacker wants to get down
and dirty with the first freed phone, the Neo 1973:

 * Neo 1973 (GTA01B_v4)
 * Battery (1200mAh) (2x)
 * Stylus
 * Headset
 * Phone Pouch
 * Lanyard
 * SanDisk 512MB MicroSD Card (2x)
 * Mini USB Connectivity Cable (2x)
 * Debug Flex Cable
 * Debug Board v2 (JTAG and serial console)
 * Ruggedized Toolbox with shoulder strap

You do not need the Advanced package to do normal kernel, or application development, only perhaps hacking on [[u-boot]].
