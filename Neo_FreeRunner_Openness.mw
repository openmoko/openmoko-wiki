Many people are more interested in getting a completely (and openly) documented hardware platform than in getting one with "just" all drivers under GPL. Why is this so? Just imagine an open source kernel which is released under a copyleft license which is incompatible to the GPL (like the OpenSolaris kernel). These poor developers would have to reverse engineer a so called "open platform" as they cannot use the available drivers and header files. If you are a GPL-is-the-only-true-license guy/girl: Don't be offended by this, it's simply about choice. :)

This page tries to give you an overview how open the GTA02 hardware is documented and where to get the documentation. Your help is needed! If you know anything which is missing just add it, if possible with a reference where the info is coming from.
