Many people are more interested in getting a completely (and openly) documented hardware platform than
in getting one with "just" all drivers under GPL. Why is this so? Just imagine an open source kernel which
is released under a copyleft license which is incompatible to the GPL. These poor developers would have
to reverse engineer a so called "open platform" as they cannot use the available drivers and header files.
If you are a GPL-is-the-only-true-license guy/girl: Don't be offended by this, it's simply about choice. :)

This page tries to give you an overview how open the GTA02 hardware is documented and where to get the
documentation. Your help is needed! If you know anything which is missing just add it, if possible with
a reference where the info is coming from.
