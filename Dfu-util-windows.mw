== dfu-util for Win32 ==

{{Note|This has been reported to work on Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Vista with the Neo FreeRunner.  No reports have been received on whether it works with other versions of Windows or with the Neo 1973.  There are some reports that image downloads and uploads are extremely slow for some people.  The exact cause of this has not yet been pinpointed.}}

In order to use dfu-util for Win32, you need to install a Windows driver when the device is in U-Boot.  Theoretically, a USB standard-compliant DFU class driver should work, unfortunately, Windows does not come bundled with one.  If you do not have a DFU class driver (ie. Windows does not recognize the device in U-Boot mode and pops up the New Device Wizard), the LibUSB-Win32 driver and accompanying INF file for the Neo FreeRunner can be used, this driver can be found in OpenmokoDFU.zip at the link below.  When the Windows New Device Wizard pops up, use this driver.

Once the driver is installed, then you can proceed and use the instructions found at the main [[dfu-util]] page.  

The above mentioned files can be downloaded at: [http://projects.openmoko.org/projects/dfu-util-win32/ http://projects.openmoko.org/projects/dfu-util-win32/]

The information below is for developers who would like to know how to compile dfu-util for Win32.

== Porting dfu-util to Windows ==

{{Note|This is entirely work in progress. Nevertheless hopefully the information on this page will serve as a starting point for anyone who find the time to take this further. After all, as many people still use Windows PCs as their every day computers, having a convenient way to re-flash a Neo from Windows would probably open up the user base.}}

=== Potential Approaches ===

* Cygwin
: Not very attactive as Cygwin binaries require Cygwin in order to run. You will not get a simple, native dfu-util.exe which can be downloaded and used on any Windows machine that way.

* MinGW/MSYS
: MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) seems to be the platform of choice.

* LibUSB-Win32
: Will only be able to be built on a Windows box

=== MinGW/MSYS port ===

The preferred order of installation is:

# Install MinGW (the core installation should be sufficient)
# Install MSYS (Note: make comes with MSYS while GCC comes with MinGW)

Here is step-by-step howto:

1. Download MinGW-5.1.4.exe from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435&package_id=240780&release_id=529741 and execute the installer. It will download additional files required and install MinGW.
: {{Note|It has often been a good idea to install into a directory that has no spaces in the filename.}}
2. Download MSYS-1.0.10.exe from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435&package_id=24963 and install.
: {{Note|Make sure to open the "Current Version: 1.0.10" folder as the newer version 1.0.11 does not have an installer yet.}}
You will need to enter the path where you installed MinGW. It's a good idea to install MinGW and MSYS next to each other, i.e. C:\SOMEDIR\MinGW and C:\SOMEDIR\MSYS.
: {{Note|For example if MinGW is installed in C:\MinGW enter 'C:/MinGW.' including the period.}}

3. Download msysDTK-1.0.1.exe from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435&package_id=67879&release_id=131044, which contains the autotools. Install into the same directory into which you installed MSYS itself. The installer might not automatically suggest the right directory.

That should give you an Icon in your Start menu in MinGW->MSYS with the name of msys. Open that one, and you will find yourself in a bourne compatible shell on your native Windows system.

You can try to execute some commends such as gcc, make, etc. to make sure you installed everything correctly.

4. Download autoconf 2.59 from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435&package_id=67879&release_id=131044.  All you need to do to install it is to use a utility like [http://www.7-zip.org/ 7-Zip] to extract the files into your msys installation directory.

5. You will also need pkg-config.  According to [http://www.mingw.org/MinGWiki/index.php/pkg-config http://www.mingw.org/MinGWiki/index.php/pkg-config], you need the following packages:

  glib
  glib-dev
  libiconv
  gettext
  pkg-config

You can get all of these from the GTK+ for Windows page at: [http://www.gtk.org/download-windows.html http://www.gtk.org/download-windows.html].  Unzip them to your msys\1.0 directory.

6. Open the file /etc/profile (C:\msys\1.0\etc\profile) with your favorite editor (make sure it uses LF line endings) and add:

  PKG_CONFIG_PATH=" /c/msys/1.0/lib/pkgconfig"

ensuring that the path is accessible from the MSYS shell and points to the pkgconfig files.

7. Download libusb-win32-device-bin-0.1.12.1.tar.gz from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=78138&package_id=79216&release_id=495011. Then, copy the libusb.a file from the LibUSB-Win32\lib\gcc directory into the MinGW\lib directory and the usb.h file from LibUSB-Win32\include into MinGW\include (or you can copy it into your dfu-util\src directory).

8. Then you will need to create a libusb.pc file in the msys\1.0\lib\pkgconfig directory.  I created the following:

  prefix=c:/msys/1.0
  exec_prefix=${prefix}
  libdir=${exec_prefix}/lib
  includedir=${prefix}/include
  Name: LibUSB
  Description: USB for Win32
  Requires: 
  Version: 0.1.12.1
  Libs: -L${libdir} -lusb
  Cflags: -I${includedir}

=== Getting dfu-util sources ===

Use your favorite Subversion client to check out the dfu-util sources.  The dfu-util sources can be checked out from [https://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/src/host/dfu-util/ https://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/src/host/dfu-util/].

=== Apply patch to compile with MinGW ===

Apply the following patch to the source code:

=== Build dfu-util ===

In the Msys shell inside the dfu-util directory, run the following command:

  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make

dfu-util should successfully compile and you should have the .exe files in the src directory. In case you get the following error

  checking for USB... configure: error: *** Required libusb >= 0.1.4 not installed ***

check your PKG_CONFIG_PATH (see above) to make sure it is correct, otherwise, you can try running the following command (if you are sure that libusb is correctly installed):

  ./configure USB_CFLAGS=-Iinclude USB_LIBS=-lusb

=== Preparing to use dfu-util ===

A Windows driver needs to be installed when the device is in U-Boot and connected through the USB.  Windows does not come with a DFU class driver and Jungo seems to be the only one that has created a DFU class driver, but it is non-free.  You can use LibUSB-Win32 as the driver for the device by creating an INF file for it for this device.  Use inf-wizard.exe, which is a part of the LibUSB-Win32 binaries distribution.  Run the wizard, select the following device:

  Vendor ID  Product ID  Description
  0x1D50      0x5119      USB Device

Insert the Manufacturer name: Openmoko, or FIC?

Insert device description: Device Firmware Upgrade

Then save the INF file along with the auto generated CAT files.

When you get the New Device Wizard when plugging in the device in U-Boot mode into Windows, select this newly generated INF file.

=== Running dfu-util ===

Once the Windows driver is successfully installed, you can try some commands:

  dfu-util --list

and you should be able to list the device.  Example:

  Found Runtime: [0x1d50:0x5119] devnum=7, cfg=0, intf=2, alt=0, name="USB Device Firmware Upgrade"  

=== Binary ===

[http://projects.openmoko.org/projects/dfu-util-win32/ http://projects.openmoko.org/projects/dfu-util-win32/]

=== Outstanding issues ===

Had to call usb_set_configuration() with configuration set to 1 before attempting to claim the device instead of using configuration 0 that the device returns.  It sounds like DFU implementation in U-Boot might not be compliant with USB spec.  A similar issue and discussion can be found here: [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.libusb.devel.windows/1546/focus=1554 http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.libusb.devel.windows/1546/focus=1554]
