The Neo1973 uses quad-band [[GSM]] (850/900/1800/1900 MHz) so any GSM provider in the world should be compatible. In general, when you are looking for a mobile solution in your region, you would need to be aware of:
* the ''network coverage'' of available providers
* different ''tariffs'' of these providers
and choose the one that is right for you. If you haven't had any experience with GSM coverage in your area, you may want to inquire locally from the available providers and people you know that may already have experienced GSM at your location. You may also want to subscribe to our mailing list. If you have doubts about the coverage for your area, you may want to borrow a GSM phone or buy an inexpensive one so that you can get a feel for how the Neo1973 will work in your area. You can help keep your cost down by using a prepaid card for your testing.

Here is some information on Prepaid GSM cards:
* [http://www.prepaidgsm.net/ PrePaidGSM - worldwide overview about GSM prepaid offers]
Think twice before choosing a tariff with long duration contracts (more than 12 months), because prices for the GPRS data tariffs are ''likely'' to lower in many countries. Also, long duration contracts are mostly combined with hardware (ie: free or steeply discounted phone with a 24 or 36 month contract). It will be worth your while to shop around for competing offers from the different providers in your area.

We chose the GSM network format for the Neo1973 because GSM is in use by more countries than any other mobile phone standard. As a result, you will have better coverage with the Neo1973, and we felt that it was the best choice for our OpenMoko devices. When the Neo1973 is successful, and we believe that it will be, we will be developing new devices that we will be bringing to market. They will be running OpenMoko and supporting additional mobile phone network standards as well. So if GSM is not available in your area (ie: some areas in the USA), OpenMoko will be bringing other options to market in the future.
