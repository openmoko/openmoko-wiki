OpenMoko uses quad-band [[GSM]] (850/900/1800/1900 MHz) so any GSM provider in the world should be compatible. Choosing the right (GSM) provider is not a special topic only for using the Neo1973 at your place - In general: when you are looking for a mobil solution at your region you would have to care abouts:
* the network coverage of different provider
* different tariffs of these provider
and choose the right for you. ;)  When your haven't experiances with GSM coverage at your town yet, it would be clearly more usefull to ask people at your town with GSM experiances - then asking our mailinglist. When you have doupts about the coverage, borrow a GSM device or buy a cheap(used) one and maybe buy a cheap prepaidcard (mostly starts at 10 US$/Euro). Good information about Prepaid GSM cards:

Think twice before choosing a tariff with long duration contracts (>= 1 year) especialy prices for GPRS data tariffs will (likly) fall (in most countries). Long duration contracts are mostly combined with hardware subvention but heavy advertised - so a second view to GSM offers beside the biggest advertisment flyers worth a view ;)

Why GSM? Because this standard is used in more contries then any other mobile phone standard. So it's coverage was the best choice for building a first device to start OpenMoko. When Neo1973/OpenMoko is succsessfull, it is very likly that there will come new devices to the market, running OpenMoko and supporting other mobile phone standards as well. When GSM has not the best coverage at your town, e.g. some region in the USA, please be patient with OpenMoko and the GSM coverage at your town...
