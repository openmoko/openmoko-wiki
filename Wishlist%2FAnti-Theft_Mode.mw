Suppose you are in a busy environment and your device is lying around somewhere. You sometimes use it but cannot look after it all the time. A sort of high risk environment for phone theft where you could put it in anti theft mode which is enabled when 
* someone moves it 
* touches the touch screen
* removes the USB/charging-plug
* removal of Bluetooth/WiFi devices in vicinity
This mode can be '''switched off by'''
* entering a password/pin (unprompted?)
* doing a certain gesture (measured by accelerometers)
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_recognition voice verficiation] ;-)
* remote-reactivating (USB, WiFi, Bluetooth)
* mixture of the above
From the moment it '''has been moved or touched'''
* it will display a warning on a red background flashing in black: ''You are committing a crime. Put this phone back, now!'' (or similar)
* do nothing. It may simulate a fake network error or similar when a number is dialed.
If it is '''not unlocked may'''
* set off a loud alarm 
* start sending messages to a predefined email address with pictures (???), GPS coordinates and network pings (???)
* activate microphone recording and send compressed audio files to a pre-defined number/e-mail-adress
* activate self-destruct mechanism ;-)

If the above '''anti-theft measures fail'''
* a special text message could be sent to the phone which erases all contacts then activates the pin lock for the phone and SIM card.
* activation of some sort remote control
