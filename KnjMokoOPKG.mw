== About ==
[[KnjMokoOPKG]] is an application to install, remove and search for software through [[Opkg]].

Instead of using [[Opkg]] directly (which is horribly slow), it uses knjOPKGDB (which is a SQLite3-database with information about the packages), making it much faster than simular tools.

It is written in [[PHP-GTK]].



== How to get it ==
It can be install through the [[Knjrepository]] like this:
 opkg install knjmokoopkg
