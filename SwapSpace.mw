WARNING: THIS MIGHT KILL YOUR SD CARD, since there might be alot of read/writes on the same spot.
The Freerunner has only 128mb ram, when this is used up applications get killed. 

Please note that the above warning do not apply to [[microSD]] (including microSDHC) card with wear-levelling algorithms/microcontrollers. (See [[#References]])

Please note that you can change the ''swappiness setting'' (low value, default 60) so the swap partition or swap file will be used as little as possible. (See [[#References]])

=Make swap when you are connected to your openmoko with ssh=
64M byte of swap just as an example
 dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=65536
Next time you boot there will be swap
 echo "/swapfile               swap                    swap    defaults        0 0">> /etc/fstab 
Make swap
 mkswap /swapfile
Make the swap file work now:
 swapon /swapfile


=Make swap when microSD card is in a card reader=
The uSD card is booted on /boot. To use this, we need to make sure that the microsd card is booted, and the Swap can be turned on.

Create the swapfile on the uSD card.
  # dd if=/dev/zero of=/boot/swapfile bs=1024k count=128
  # mkswap /boot/swapfile

Now, we can put in an init script for [[Fyp]] which does this for us everytime we boot.

  # touch /etc/init.d/extswap.sh
  # chmod +x /etc/init.d/extswap.sh
  # cat > /etc/init.d/extswap.sh
  #! /bin/sh
  ### BEGIN INIT INFO

One more thing to consider is that flash-devices handle their space in blocks. The blocksize typically varies between 16KB and 512 KB.

A swappiness setting of zero means that the disk will be avoided unless absolutely necessary (you run out of memory), while a swappiness setting of 100 means that programs will be swapped to disk almost instantly..."
