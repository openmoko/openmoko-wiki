These are consumer units that Openmoko phones can be considered to be in competition with, based on featureset and price point.

==iPhone==
See [[iPhone]]

==Sony PSP==

Portable Game System

Price: $170

====Interfaces====
*Wifi
*IR
*USB (terminal device only)
*Headset (audio out + mic in)
*Game keys
*Memory Stick

====Accessories====
*GPS
*Camera

====Features====
*Multimedia: MP3, MP4, jpg, AAC, ATRAC. Multimedia capability is adequate. Controls are not necessarily intuitive, given that it's a gaming unit, and not a media player, though third party and earphone jack media remote control is available. Memory is provided by removable flash (Sony Memory Stick, proprietary) up to 4Gb in size, which is plenty large enough for movies at full resolution. And the screen! My god, it's full of stars! The PSP screen is pretty much the best screen going, both  in terms of size and clarity, unless the iPhone has done better. Unlike the iPhone and the Neo1973, no touchscreen. UMD is irrelevant to this discussion.
*Networking:
TCP/IP over Wifi. Applications include network firmware update, RSS/Podcast downloading and streaming, internet video viewing using Sony's Location Free Base Station (ala Slingbox),  VoIP, and a web browser.

====Flaws====
No keyboard, and no keyboard support, neither infrared nor USB. And the text entry UI relies on, ahem, cellphone styled number keying. No GSM. Too much Sony propriety.
