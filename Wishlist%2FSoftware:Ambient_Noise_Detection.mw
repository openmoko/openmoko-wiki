== Ambient noise dependent ringing volume ==
Ringing volume is dependent on the ambient noise. Adjust the ring tone volume to be heard over the background noise. I.e. ring nice and quietly (or on vibrate) when in a quiet library, or ring at full volume when in a noisy bar.

The ambient noise level is measured using the microphone.

== Use Cases ==
Here are some possible use cases:

* I'm in a noisy bar and somebody is calling me, I need to hear the phone ringing
* I'm in a quiet library and somebody is calling me, I don't want other people to be disturbed by the ringtone

== Design Issues ==
The ambient noise level might be muffled in pockets, and therefore would not ring as loudly while inside a pocket when it should.

Maybe it can analyze how loudly it hears itself ringing and adapt as it rings? If it's in a pocket, it will supposedly hear itself ringing more quietly than if say on a table. If it kept constantly adapting it would also go quieter once you drag it out of your pocket, bag or whatever.
