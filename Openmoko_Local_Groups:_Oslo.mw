Welcome to the OpenMoko group for people near Oslo, [[OpenMoko_Local_Groups:_Norway|Norway]]!

This page is supposed to function as a means for Openmoko interested people near Oslo to find each other and get organized. Since the community is still quite small, please remember to add yourself to the list.

The list also shows who you can contact to ask for help if you have bricked your device and need to borrow a [[Debug board|debug board]] to unbrick it.

=== Local events ===
 TBD. Until we get a proper mailing list, you can use [[Talk:OpenMoko_Local_Groups:_Oslo|discussion page]] for suggestions
 about local events.
