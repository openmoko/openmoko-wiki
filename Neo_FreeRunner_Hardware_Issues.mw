This is a community-written page that discusses '''hardware issues''' with the Freerunner/[[GTA02]] device. Information here is unofficial (and possibly incorrect) unless otherwise stated. Corrections and clarifications from [[Openmoko]] employees would be greatly appreciated.

Also please '''DON'T PANIC''' when reading this page. Please give Openmoko employees time to investigate these issues and to develop a solution.  Some of the items may turn out to be non-issues, or may have software workarounds.

=== Active Issues ===


==== GPS Slow TTFF ====

Issue: The GPS signal is degraded to the point where the unit cannot reliably get a "cold-start" fix. See [[GPS_Problems]]. 

Reason #1: For some reason, the [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-July/021774.html MicroSD controller] on the Freerunner is interfering with GPS reception.

Reason #2: Poor soldering and/or mechanical deformation of the internal GPS antenna connector on some devices. See [[FreeRunner_GPS_antenna_repair_SOP]]

Affects: unknown percentage of devices

Status of #1: [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/openmoko-kernel/2008-July/003777.html Software workaround] found; hardware fix [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-July/022528.html described here].

Status of #2: unknown

Workarounds: Remove the microSD card. Use an external GPS antenna. Supplying almanac data and approximate coordinates in software (so that the chip can perform a "warm" acquisition) may also help.

==== Poor Audio Quality ====

Issue: The person on the other end of a GSM phone call may experience poor audio quality, to the point where he/she cannot carry on a normal conversation.

There are three related aspects to this issue:
* Call is too quiet (mixer settings for mic and/or earpiece are set too low)
* Caller hears a loud echo of their own voice [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1267 #1267]
* Buzzing noise caused by GSM radio interference [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/883 #883] [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1352 #1352]

Affects: all devices but only some users (depending on many factors)

Status: Under investigation. There is a possibility that the quality can be made "good enough" through software (mixer settings). 

Workarounds: Using a bluetooth headset is a possibility. 

==== PMU/Charger Issue ====

Issue: The device may fail to boot or charge the battery if the battery is deeply discharged (far enough that its internal protection circuitry is activated). See for example this thread on the [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/openmoko-kernel/2008-June/003326.html kernel list].

If the battery's terminal voltage is low but greater than zero then the Neo1973 recovery method may work: Disconnect USB, remove the battery, wait 10 seconds, re-insert the battery, re-connect USB, let it charge for 1 hour (or more) without pressing any buttons.

Affects: Unknown. Some discussions on the mailing list may refer to pre-production devices. 

Status: Fixed with [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/openmoko-kernel/2008-July/003799.html Werner Almesberger patches] - [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/commitlog/2008-July/005403.html more here]

Workarounds: See http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-July/021556.html

==== Some SIMs Don't Work ====

Issue: There are reports that some users cannot register with their GSM network when using certain SIM cards. See for example http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-July/020370.html

It is possible that there is more than one issue involved here. The observed problems ''might'' (i.e. some items are only speculation at this point) be caused by: 

* User error, not inserting the SIM in the correct orientation or not sliding the holder to the 'locked' position

* Software issues that result in a locked SIM (not properly prompting the user for a PIN and then passing this to the SIM)

* Mechanical issues with the SIM holder that prevent the pins from making reliable contact with the pads on the SIM. Note that only 6 of the 8 pins are used, and the remaining two are not connected.

* Electrical incompatibility (some tests show problems with 1.8V SIMs while 2.9V ones work OK)

* Firmware bugs in the TI Calypso GSM chipset. Note that one issue in this category was found and fixed on the GTA01 devices (#666 in Trac), and that specific problem should not affect the Freerunner.

* Defective SIMs, i.e. ones that do not comply with the applicable standards and are acknowledged as being defective by the carrier (even if they happen to work in some phones). 

See also: http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Carriers/ATT

Affects: Only a subset of users (details unknown).

Status: Under investigation

Workarounds: It may be possible to obtain a different model of SIM from your GSM carrier.

==== Empty NOR Flash ====

Issue: NOR flash (backup copy of u-boot) is not programmed. [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1568 #1568]

Affects: Unknown - maybe only 1 or 2 devices? Also need to confirm that the bug report was from a mass-production unit rather than an earlier prototype.

Status: Unknown

Workarounds: Use the NAND copy of u-boot and be careful not to brick the device unless a debug-board is available.

==== Debug board has wrong vendor/product ID ====

Issue: A debug board is not reporting the expected USB Vendor/Product ID.

Affects: Only [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/device-owners/2008-July/001775.html one report] has been seen so far.

Status: Unknown

Workarounds: Edit configuration files (e.g. openocd.conf) to use the IDs that the board is reporting.

=== Known/Accepted Issues ===

This section lists items that are acknowledged as being less than ideal, but are considered to be acceptable in the shipping product. They will not be discussed in detail on this page.

* Poor performance + slow bus speed of the Glamo GPU - discussed to death on the mailing lists and IRC.  
* [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/hardware/2008-April/000055.html GPS antenna switch] driven out-of-spec - does not appear to have a significant effect on device performance
* Poor low-frequency audio response with low-impedance headphones, e.g. as discussed in this thread:   http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/openmoko-kernel/2008-March/001999.html  (NOTE - this thread refers to pre-mass-production devices)

=== Resolved Issues ===

These are issues that have been discussed in the past, but have been fixed (or turned out not to be a problem) for the mass-produced devices.

* Excessive LED current - Some early units lacked a current-limiting resistor for the LEDs. This has been fixed for the production units.
* Battery life - At this time it appears that the Freerunner battery life will be acceptable once suspend/resume support has been implemented in software.
