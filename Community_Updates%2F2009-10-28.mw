==Openmoko Development Survey==
Kerstin from Open Innovation Projects has completed a survey on the influence of open source development in the openmoko project. The full results are available here: http://open-innovation-projects.org/openmoko-survey-results/ 

The results of the survey shouldn't be too much of a surprise given the nature of this particular project. The overwhelming majority of respondents agree with statements like "I really care about the fate of the project" and "I enjoy being part of this community". The community is mostly male, young (average age = 30) and well educated with over half of respondents indicating they have at least a university level degree. 

===Work Distribution===
With regard to the split between developers and users, the community seems to be led by a small number of lead developers committing the majority of the work. The largest group indentify themselves as part of the community with just under a third identifying themselves as end-users. 

===Documentation===
Access to documentation is important for the members of the openmoko community. The level of access granted to the community is satisfactory with over half of members indicating a strong degree of satisfaction with the level of access to software documentation and just under half for the hardware documentation. The community is satisfied with the ease of access to the community documentation with less than 5% of respondents finding it difficult to access software/hardware documentation. The community documentation is deemed to be useful by the majority of respondents. However, the number of respondents finding it difficult to contribute due to lack of information suggests a disparity between the perceived ease of access and value of documentation and the breadth of coverage. Few respondents were completely satisfied by the available information. The story is a little worse for 3rd party documentation as is to be expected. This can be considered an area for improvement. The level of access granted to documentation has a bearing on the satisfaction of developers as shown by the level of satisfation with the completeness of the documentation.

===Community Influence===
Despite the fact that few respondents indicated a leading role in the development of software and identified themselves as end users or community members they majority felt they were able to influence the direction of the project. This indicates that the lead developers are listening to users and there seems to be a high level of satisfaction amongst users with their ability to influence the direction of development.
