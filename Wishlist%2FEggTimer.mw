=== Egg Timer ===

There are four basic types of timers:  count down timers, lap timers, chess/task timers and alarms.

=== Count Down Timers ===

Count down timers are used to tell you when the pizza is done, when it's time to change the laundry, when you've been staring at your computer screen for too long, et cetera.   They're generally called "egg timers".  To be useful, the basic functions must be quick and easy to use: mostly a single click.

Basic functions:

# set a timer length
# pause/restart
# clear
# start the timer with the previously elapsed time
# add or subtract a small increment of time

The best egg timer interface I have run across is [http://www.freewarepalm.com/clock/1touchtimer.shtml 1TouchTimer] for the Palm Pilot.  

=== Lap Timers ===

The most important feature is an incrementing timer display with as big a font as possible.  There is also a log of the time between successive presses of the lap buttons.

I haven't looked at a lot of lap timers, but the best for the palm pilot seems to be [http://ogin.net/spaware/plap/index_e.html Parallel Lap].

=== Chess Timers ===

Chess timers are used to divide time up into tasks.  A "real" chess timer only has two tasks, but these are typically used to measure how long is spent on various activities.  They can get very sophisticated because they are often used for billing customers.

=== Alarms ===

These timers ring the alarm at a specific time, rather than after a specific interval.  Presumably they will be handled well by the [[Calendar]] app.
