This is a skeleton to try and get the strengths and weaknesses of the various distributions available for the Neo listed in one place.  Please help contribute!

Initial information is available at http://www.vanille-media.de/site/index.php/2008/06/28/gtk-asu-fso-tmtla/

I will probably start with what is there and fill in what I can.


== Features by Distribution ==
{| border=1 |
| Feature || OM2007.2 || FSO || ASU || SHR
|-
| Description || The Openmoko 2007.2 Stack, utilizing GTK+ and assorted applications. 2007.2, since it was the 2nd iteration of the GTK+ user interface that we released in 2007. || The FSO Stack, also known as the Openmoko Framework initiative. This one is called FSO, because it’s an implementation of the freesmartphone.org APIs. You may also have seen the term Zhone which describes the framework testing user interface and is a minor part of this stack. || August Software Update.  The ASU Stack, the combination of a classical smartphone stack based on Trolltech’s Qtopia ported to X11 and enhanced with an EFL-based launcher and new applications. You may have seen the term Illume which is the launcher of ASU. || Stable Hybrid Release, a combination of the FSO, some of the 2007.2 GTK software, and the ASU that provides all of the functionality of the 2007.2 software, but with the stability of the FSO.
