This is a skeleton to try and get the strengths and weaknesses of the various distributions available for the Neo listed in one place.  Please help contribute!

Initial information is available at http://www.vanille-media.de/site/index.php/2008/06/28/gtk-asu-fso-tmtla/

I will probably start with what is there and fill in what I can.

We need to develop a list of features that we want to track.
