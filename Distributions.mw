Openmoko distributions are designed to run on various mobile devices, with the primary aim of supporting Openmoko Inc.'s [[GTA01:Neo 1973|Neo 1973]] and [[Neo FreeRunner]] phones. They are GNU/Linux distributions -- complete operating systems with more or less user applications. You can install any of them on your phone or even have a multiboot system with two distributions installed.

While the Openmoko distributions will run on [[Supported devices|other mobile devices]] too, some other software distributions will also run on the Openmoko Inc. phones (see below).

For downloads see [[Download]], for installation instructions see [[Flashing the Neo FreeRunner]].

== About distributions ==

As of November 3rd, 2008:
* The phones ship with [[Om 2007.2]]. It is not supported by Openmoko Inc. anymore. But community developpers continue to work on it as the [[SHR]] project.
* The branch currently supported by Openmoko Inc. is [[Om 2008.9 Update]], which is a minor upgrade of [[Om 2008.8]] (formerly named ASU). Based on that, the community made the [[FDOM]] distribution by adding lots of fixes and applications to it.
* The trunk tip is a "base image" on which the next major release should be based. This next release can be previewed by installing milestones of the [[FSO]] - Free Smartphone.Org project. The [[Debian]] packaging team also track that branch.
* The FreeRunner is a reference platform for TrollTech's Qt Extended (formerly [[Qtopia]]) distribution.
* The Android port is work-in-progress.

Which distribution should I use ?
* Most new users find [[FDOM]] the most comprehensive and functional distribution.
* If you want "just a phone", try [[Qtopia]].
* If you want to develop anything that last, your target is [[FSO]].
* [[SHR]], [[Debian]], [[Gentoo]] and [[Android]] are for developers who know where they are.
* Tracking the "base image" by updating daily from testing/unstable is a different game either.

Note that unresolved hardware/kernel/drivers issues bite all distributions in more or less the same way.

Most of these distributions also have package repositories. It is a BAD idea to feed from another distribution's repository. Upgrade path between these distributions are not tested enough, thus updating by changing the feeds will most likely end in broken packages or even an unbootable system. It is advisable to reflash the whole filesystem with [[dfu-util]] to switch between the different distributions, with the reminder that a dual-boot setup (e.g. via sdcard or NFS) can be used.

== Openmoko Inc. driven release targets ==

These different 'release targets' are built out of different branches of the [[OpenEmbedded]] metadistribution source tree.

=== Om 2008.9 ===

The Om 2008.9 Update is the first point release after the initial Om 2008.8 release. Openmoko recommends that all existing installations of Om 2008.8 should be updated to that version. Quality-wise, we are still far from the goal, but this version includes general stability enhancing operating system improvements and a new splash screen. No applications were added or removed. Users with basic telephony needs will find it tolerable as an everyday phone.

{{Main|Om 2008.9 Update}}

=== Om 2008.8 ===

Om 2008.8 was released on August 8, 2008, to replace 2007.2. Prior to that, its codename was ASU (April/August Software Update). This is still the name of the branch in the version control system. This distribution integrates the [http://trolltech.com/products/qtopia Qtopia] phone stack with a set of new Openmoko applications based on the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries. Qtopia being a more mature product than the GNOME Mobile stack, the standard phone applications (dialer, contacts, calculator, calendar) work better than in 2007.2. The Qtopia used in 2008.8 was ported to run on X11, contrary to standard Qtopia which uses the framebuffer. This allows non-Qt applications to safely share the screen with Qt applications. This is a .0 release, many unresolved issues remain in the lower layers (kernel power management, sound, wifi drivers...).

{{Main|Om2008.8}}

=== Om 2007.2 ===

[[Om 2007.2]] is the base-system which is installed on FreeRunner when it leaves the factory. The interface was totally finger-oriented,  optimized for 285ppi, and very orange. It used the GTK+ stack, which is part of the [http://www.gnome.org/mobile/ GNOME Mobile] platform. This distribution is now considered obsolete and not being worked on by Openmoko Inc or by OpenedHand. There is a community effort (see [[SHR]]) to port the GTK based telephony applications to the future middleware from [[FSO]].

{{Main|Om 2007.2}}

=== FSO - freesmartphone.org ===

FSO has been started to overcome the deficiencies both of the 2007.2 and the 2008.8 stack, namely to come up with an extensible framework that gives developers the infrastructure they need to create solid and exciting software products based on the Openmoko platform. An infrastructure that supports competing UIs while we can collaborate on developing services, making the framework strong . Here, the focus is on stable highlevel services that you can access from whatever language or UI that supports [http://dbus.freesmartphone.org/ dbus]. People report that despite its infancy, e.g. the phone server part in FSO is already more solid than anywhere else.

It is not really intended as future release-target, but used as a 'vessel' or 'container' for the development and testing of the new, future middleware.

The applications installed are intended as test-tools for the new middleware and not as fully featured, end user oriented applications. (even if it looks that way sometimes)

In the words of Mickey, project manager:

<blockquote><em>FSO is only a distro because "we can" (thanks to OpenEmbedded). Zhone is an independent UI application based on the FSO framework to facilitate testing. If you want to build own UIs or custom applications on the forthcoming Openmoko dbus service framework, then the FSO-image is a good starting point.</em></blockquote>

== Openmoko Community driven release targets ==

=== SHR - Stable Hybrid Release ===

SHR is mainly a community driven distribution, that contains some basic applications which make use of the FSO. There currently is a EFL (with elementary) dialer, messages and contacts application programmed in C.

{{Main|Stable Hybrid Release}}

=== FDOM (FAT and Dirty Openmoko) ===

[[FDOM]] is a distribution based on Openmoko's currently supported image, updated with many ready-to-use applications and with fixes posted in the mailing lists.

{{Main|FDOM}}

== Non-Openmoko distributions ==

These are not Openmoko (and OE) based distributions. These are alternatives you can run on your Openmoko phones.

=== Qt Extended ===

The Qt Extended distribution (formerly known as Qtopia) from [http://www.trolltech.com Trolltech] aims to provide a ready-to use image for Openmoko devices.

* [[Qtopia_/_Qt_Extended_on_FreeRunner|Qt Extended]]
* Download: [http://www.qtopia.net/modules/mydownloads/viewcat.php?cid=6 Qtopia.net]

=== Debian ===

In the words of Joachim "nomeata" Breitner from the [http://wiki.debian.org/Teams/DebianFSO pkg-fso] team:

:It’s not really a distribution in the Openmoko sense of the word, but rather a different underlying system for Openmoko distributions. At the moment, we ship the software from the FSO stack, but hopefully we’ll also have, for example, the Stable Hybrid Release software in our archive.

:So for now, Debian is a different way of installing FSO, which takes more space and provides more programs :-)

{{Main|Debian}}

=== Gentoo ===

{{Main|Gentoo}}

=== Android ===

Android is a mobile phone platform by Google, and later the Open Handset Alliance (OHA).

'''Openmoko''' is fully supporting Android running on the Freerunner. Details along with images are being constructed at the moment. Visit the user web page for [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/User:Seanmcneil3 Sean McNeil] for further details.
And you can download kernel and image [http://people.openmoko.org/sean_mcneil/ here]
