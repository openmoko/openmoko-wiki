Openmoko distributions are similar to any other Linux distribution, they are complete operating systems with user applications. You can choose to install any of these on your phone, you can even have multiboot system with two distributions installed.

Openmoko distributions are designed to run on various mobile devices, with the primary aim of Openmoko Inc.'s [[Neo 1973]] and [[Neo FreeRunner]] phones. While the Openmoko distributions will run on [[Supported hardware|other mobile devices]] too, some other software distributions will also run on the Openmoko Inc. phones.

For downloads see [[Latest Images]], for installation instructions see [[Flashing the Neo FreeRunner]].

Distribution descriptions are from Mickey Lauer's [http://www.vanille-media.de/site/index.php/2008/06/28/gtk-asu-fso-tmtla/ GTK, ASU, FSO, TMTLA!].

== Openmoko Inc. distributions ==

=== Openmoko 2007.2 ===

Openmoko2007.2 is for people who are familiar with the [http://www.gnome.org/mobile/ GNOME Mobile] initiative and who want to write applications that run on multiple devices running (parts of) GNOME Mobile. This includes Maemo, which runs on the Nokia Internet Tablets. The strength of the GTK+ stack is a UI and programming environment similar to what you run on your Linux desktop, if you’re into GNOME. The GTK+ has PIM applications based on the Evolution Data Server and runs the gsmd phone server. Although you can use them, the applications are still pretty rough und unfinished. Some people have problems with the stability of the phone server.

* [[Openmoko2007.2]]
* Availabilty: [http://buildhost.openmoko.org/daily/ Official Buildhost] and [[MokoMakefile]] support for development builds
* Download: [http://buildhost.openmoko.org/daily/freerunner/  Releases are labeled "openmoko-devel-image" ]

=== ASU - April Software Update ===

ASU - April/August Software Update - has been started to integrate the [http://trolltech.com/products/qtopia Qtopia] stack - on X11 - with a new set of graphically pleasing applications based on the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries. Qtopia is a more mature product than the GNOME Mobile stack and you can expect all the standard feature phone applications to work in a solid way. It uses the Qtopia phone server. Since - contrary to standard Qtopia - it does not directly use the framebuffer, non-Qt applications can safely share the screen with Qt applications, that is until you are writing applications that do not communicate with the framework. If you want to integrate, then you’re back to C++ and Qt.

=== FSO - freesmartphone.org ===

FSO has been started to overcome the deficiencies both of the 2007.2 and the ASU stack, namely to come up with an extensible framework that gives developers the infrastructure they need to create solid and exciting software products based on the Openmoko platform. An infrastructure that supports competing UIs while we can collaborate on developing services, making the framework strong . Here, the focus is on stable highlevel services that you can access from whatever language or UI that supports [http://dbus.freesmartphone.org/ dbus]. People report that despite its infancy, e.g. the phone server part in FSO is already more solid than anywhere else.

=== SHR - Stable Hybrid Release ===

Stable Hybrid Release, a combination of the FSO, some of the 2007.2 GTK software, and the ASU that provides all of the functionality of the 2007.2 software, but with the stability of the FSO.

* [[Stable Hybrid Release]]

== Non-Openmoko Inc. distributions ==

These are not Openmoko Inc. software stacks. These are an alternative distributions you can run on your Openmoko phones.

=== Qtopia ===

The Qtopia distribution from [http://www.trolltech.com Trolltech], it aims to provide a ready-to use image for Openmoko devices.

=== Debian ===

Debian Linux, the whole distribution, on a mobile phone.
