== About distributions ==
Openmoko distributions are designed to run on various mobile devices, with the primary aim of supporting Openmoko Inc.'s [[GTA01:Neo 1973|Neo 1973]] and [[Neo FreeRunner]] phones. They are GNU/Linux distributions -- complete operating systems including user applications. You can install any of them on your phone or even have a dualboot system with two distributions installed. For downloads see [[Download]], for installation instructions see [[Flashing the Neo FreeRunner]].

Besides, Openmoko distributions also run on [[Supported devices|other]] mobile devices and some other software distributions also run on the phones of Openmoko Inc.

=== Choosing a distribution ===
Currently the most used distributions are [[Om 2008]], which comes preinstalled on the Neo FreeRunner, and [[Stable Hybrid Release|SHR]].[http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=p2ZQdcRSVg9XfYLwBVsZicg]

In the future [[Om 2009]] will be the default distribution. It is currently under development and should be released in june 2009. Like SHR it will be based on the [[freesmartphone.org]] framework.

Furthermore, there are many other distributions, like [[Qt Extended]] (for stable basic functions), Google's [[Android]], and some [[Debian]]-based distros.

=== Please note ===

* Stable in the FreeRunner world does not mean the same thing as stable in the Debian world.
* Most distributions use the same bootloader, kernel, drivers and hardware. Therefore, the same low level bugs are commonly found in all distributions. The latest and greatest software usually has most bug fixes, plus a whole set of new fresh bugs.
* Most of these distributions also have package repositories. It is a BAD idea to feed from another distribution's repository.
* Upgrade path between these distributions are mostly not tested, thus updating by changing the feeds will most likely end in broken packages or even an unbootable system. It is advisable to reflash the whole filesystem with [[dfu-util]] to switch between the different distributions, with the reminder that a dual-boot setup (e.g. via sdcard or NFS) can be used.

== Official Openmoko releases ==

'Release targets' offered by Openmoko Inc. are built out of different branches of the [[OpenEmbedded]] metadistribution source tree.

=== Om series ===

* '''[[Om 2009]]''' is intended to be the new distro; it is not a simple follow-on from [[Om 2008]]. It is based on the [http://freesmartphone.org freesmartphone.org] milestone 5.5 framework.

{{Main|Om2009}}

* '''[[Om 2008]]''' was released on August 8, 2008, to replace 2007.2. Prior to that, its codename was ASU (April/August Software Update). This is still the name of the branch in the version control system. This distribution integrates the [http://trolltech.com/products/qtopia Qtopia] phone stack with a set of new Openmoko applications based on the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries ([[EFL_Documentation|EFL]]). Qtopia being a more mature product than the GNOME Mobile stack, the standard phone applications (dialer, contacts, calculator, calendar) work better than in 2007.2. The Qtopia used in 2008.8 was ported to run on X11, contrary to standard Qtopia which uses the framebuffer. This allows non-Qt applications to safely share the screen with Qt applications. 

{{Main|Om 2008}}

* '''[[Om 2007.2]]''' was the first distribution created by Openmoko. The interface was totally finger-oriented,  optimized for 285ppi, and very orange. It used the GTK+ stack, which is part of the [http://www.gnome.org/mobile/ GNOME Mobile] platform. This distribution is now considered obsolete and not being worked on by Openmoko Inc or by OpenedHand. 

{{Main|Om 2007.2}}

== Openmoko community releases ==

=== SHR - Stable Hybrid Release ===

SHR is a community driven distribution. It contains some basic EFL based applications which make use of the FSO. There currently is an [[EFL_Documentation|EFL]] (with elementary) dialer, messages and contacts application programmed in C, as well as a nice Settings-GUI in Python. As of April 12th, 2009, there is no stable release of this distribution yet, as the SHR team doesn't feel it to be good enough. You can find images though on the [http://shr.bearstech.com/shr-testing SHR buildhost].

{{Main|Stable Hybrid Release}}

=== FDOM (FAT and Dirty Openmoko) ===

[[FDOM]] is a distribution based on Openmoko's currently supported image, updated with many ready-to-use applications and with fixes posted in the mailing lists. A combination of applications (everything goes) and fixes to demonstrate the capabilities of the Freerunner and to have a functional phone (sort of). This all while retaining the ability to update through the official feeds.

{{Main|FDOM}}

=== Non-Openmoko distributions ===

These are not Openmoko (and OE) based distributions. These are alternatives you can run on your Openmoko phones.

==== Qt Extended ====
Qt Extended has had several names. The current name is <b>Qt Extended Improved</b>. An Openmoko-based community develops Qt Extended Improved as a Free Software project. Qt Extended Improved builds on the foundation of Qt Extended/Qtopia/Qt by Qt Software/Trolltech. Qt Extended Improved provides a robust telephony stack, a webkit based browser and other smartphone features.

On 5th March 2009 Qt Software released Qt Extended 4.4.3. On 3rd March 2009 Qt Software announced that Qt Extended would 4.4.3 would be the last release of the Qt Extended product. Prior to version 4.3, Qt Extended was known as Qtopia.

{{Main|Qtopia / Qt Extended on FreeRunner}}

==== Debian ====
Debian is "the universal operating system". It comes with thousands and thousands of packages (most of them designed for desktops or servers so far). So in the words of Joachim "nomeata" Breitner from the [http://wiki.debian.org/Teams/DebianFSO pkg-fso] team, this is not really a distribution in the Openmoko sense of the word, but rather a different underlying system for Openmoko distributions. At the moment, we ship the software from the FSO stack, but hopefully weâ€™ll also have, for example, the Stable Hybrid Release software in our archive. So for now, Debian is a different way of installing FSO, which takes more space and provides more programs :-)

{{Main|Debian}}

==== [[Gentoo ]]====
Gentoo is all about choices. When installing Gentoo, this is made clear to you several times -- you can choose how much you want to compile yourself, how to install Gentoo, what system logger you want, etc. Gentoo is a fast, modern metadistribution with a clean and flexible design. Gentoo is built around free software and doesn't hide from its users what is beneath the hood. Portage, the package maintenance system which Gentoo uses, is written in Python, meaning you can easily view and modify the source code. Gentoo's packaging system uses source code (although support for precompiled packages is included too) and configuring Gentoo happens through regular textfiles. In other words, openness everywhere.

{{Main|Gentoo}}

==== Android ====
[http://code.google.com/android/ Android] is a software stack for mobile devices developed by the [http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/ The Open Handset Alliance.] Openmoko is fully supporting Android running on the Freerunner.

Android has now reached a point where it is usable on the FreeRunner as an everyday phone, there are, however, still some caveats. Check out the main Android section of the wiki for more info.

{{Main|Android}}You can also visit the user web page for [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/User:Seanmcneil3 Sean McNeil] for some more info.

====Slackware====
As of release 12.2, Slackware is now officially supported on the Neo Freerunner
[http://armedslack.org/]


==== Hackable:1====
Hackable1 is a community distribution for hackable devices like the Neo Freerunner. It is based on Debian and 2007.2 userland which has been abandoned by Openmoko. It follows the GNOME mobile platform. 
{{Main|Hackable:1}}

====[[neovento]]====
neovento (ex FYP) is a [[Debian|Debian on Freerunner]] based [[Distributions|distribution]] which uses [http://lxde.org/ LXDE] and [[Zhone]] on top. It is a [http://freeyourphone.de FreeYourPhone.de] community project. 

{{Main|neovento}}

====[[OpenWRT]]====
The OpenWRT Development Trunk supports Freerunner, too. [http://www.openwrt.org/]


====Mer====
[[Mer]] is a distribution based on [[Maemo]].

==== Others / unreleased ====
* The [http://www.neopwn.com/software.php NeoPwn] network auditng system's core is a modified Linux 2.6.24 kernel, with cross-compiled module driver support for the numerous compatible addon devices running on a FULL Debian (ARMEL) operating system. The filesystem has been optimized for performance and size and includes the NeoPwn menu system and several GUI dialogs for hardware control and attack automation. ''Status: Unknown, the GPL requires source code to be distributed only to customers''.
* [http://runningbear.org/trac RunningBear] is an innovative, yet free and open-source Operating System for hackable devices driven by Bearstech. Lightweight, Portable, Secure, Friendly and Useful. ''Status: In development''.
* [http://pokylinux.org/ Poky] and Sato, by OpenedHand/Intel. An open source platform build tool derived from OE. It is a complete software development environment for the creation of Linux devices. It enables you to design, develop, build, debug, and test a complete, modern, software stack using Linux, the X Window System and GNOME Mobile based application frameworks for both ARM and x86 based platforms. ''Status: The "Nightly Build" Image works fine on Neo Freerunner, but phone functionality doesn't.''
* [http://pyneo.org/ PyNeo] pyneo is a stack for mobile devices excessivly using dbus, glib and evas. Pyneo is NO distribution but a middleware or framework like FSO which itself developed from a very early version of pyneo. Current pyneo images are entirely based on debian instead of oe. ''Status: still active and in development! ask around on #pyneo.org ''
* [http://www.quantum-step.com/ mySTEP] by Openmoko distributor Golden Delicious Computers is based on GNUstep and brings a Objective-C API to the Neo. Core GUI frameworks are "Foundation" & "AppKit". It has been shown on FOSDEM 2008, LinuxTag 2008 and SYSTEMS 2008 to run on the Neo 1973. If someone reengineers UIKit, (open) source code compatibility to iPhone apps appears achievable. ''Status: it does not have its own kernel so a Freerunner distribution waits for a solid basis and an arm-linux-gnueabi toolchain that runs natively on Mac OS X is currently lacking.''

== Features by distribution/release target ==

Generally, distributions can differ on one or more of the following components:
* The bootsplash screen image. This is purely decorative.
* The bootloader. Theoretically, any version of ''uboot'' could be used with any distribution. In the future ''Qi'' will replace ''uboot''.
* The kernel. GNU/Linux kernels versions 2.6.24, 2.6.26 or 2.6.28 can be found. Some have modules compiled in, others have modules compiled separately. If compiled separately, modules can be distributed in the same package file as the kernel or separately.
* Middleware: daemons to handle GSM calls or GPS, sound system, personal information storage and so on. Qt and Android have their own subsystems, FreeSmartphone.Org (FSO) is working towards a standard-based Free Software one.
* Display driver. The original ''Qt Extended'' uses the framebuffer, most other distributions today use ''X11''.
* Libraries and application framework (widget toolkit and  and graphical environment) : EFL, Qt, Gtk+ or Java ?
* Basic telephony applications: voice calls, SMS, alarm clock...
* Smartphone applications: GPS, media player, simple games, web browser...
* Open source applications: more games, scientific, you name it...
