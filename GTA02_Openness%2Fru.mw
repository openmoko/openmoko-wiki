Many people are more interested in getting a completely (and openly) documented hardware platform than in getting one with "just" all drivers under GPL. Why is this so? Just imagine an open source kernel which is released under a copyleft license which is incompatible to the GPL (like the OpenSolaris kernel). These poor developers would have to reverse engineer a so called "open platform" as they cannot use the available drivers and header files. If you are a GPL-is-the-only-true-license guy/girl: Don't be offended by this, it's simply about choice. :)

This page tries to give you an overview how open the GTA02 hardware is documented and where to get the documentation. Your help is needed! If you know anything which is missing just add it, if possible with a reference where the info is coming from.

|CPU
|Samsung S3C2442
|Docs available from Samsung, but not easily. Only after registering and qualifying. [http://www.elektronika.opatnet.cz/datasheet/U/um_s3c2442b_rev12.pdf here] is a copy.  um_s3c2442b_rev12.pdf]

|NAND flash
|Samsung?
|Standard [[NAND]] command-set.
|-
|GSM modem
|TI Calypso?
|Speaks standard protocols with proprietary extensions. Most of the proprietary extensions are present also in some BenQ and/or Enfora Enabler modems which have open documentation available on internet. See also [[GTA01 gsm modem]]. The NDAd documentation for the calypso, [http://cryptome.org/ti-calypso1.pdf register definition] and [http://cryptome.org/ti-calypso2.pdf hardware definition] was leaked onto a public forum on the 4th of March by persons or persons unknown.
The legality of reading these files may vary according to your local laws, as may generating code from them.
