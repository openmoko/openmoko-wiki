== installing ==

* download exactly these versions of '''[[Om 2009]]''' from z0ph
{{Main|Om2009}}
* fash '''[[qi]]''', '''[[kernel]]''', root image to your neo (i tested this on '''[[GTA02]]'''v6)
* unpack the comtomize pack to your SD-Card (to /media/card). don't do this under windows!! or your execute bits will get lost (you have been warned)

== start up ==
* boot up your neo, and let it run until paroli has logged in to your GSM net
* then shout neo down (press and hold power button for a few seconds)
* boot up your neo again, and let paroli log in to your GSM network again.

== localize for AT ==
* now connect your neo with usb and login via ssh
* start (as root on your neo):

 cd /media/card/
 ./init_om2009.sh

this will take some time !! have coffee ready :-)
