* download customize pack from z0ph
     '''4.''' [http://work.zoff.cc/openmoko/om2009/de_at/customize_pack.tar.gz] customize pack 
* if you want it quick, you can instead download customize pack[http://work.zoff.cc/openmoko/om2009/de_at/customize_pack_no_maps.tar.gz] without navit maps, its much smaller
* fash '''[[qi]]''', '''[[kernel]]''' and root image to your neo (i tested this on '''[[GTA02]]'''v6). Detailed instructions for [[Flashing_the_Neo_Freerunner|Freerunner]]
* unpack the customize pack to your SD-Card (to /media/card). don't do this under windows!! or your execute bits will get lost (you have been warned)

== Startup ==
* boot up your neo, and let it run until paroli has logged in to your GSM net
* then shout neo down (press and hold power button for a few seconds)
* boot up your neo again, and let paroli log in to your GSM network again.

== Localize for AT ==
* now connect your neo with usb and login via ssh
* start (as root on your neo):

 cd /media/card/
 ./init_om2009.sh

* this will take some time !! have coffee ready :-)
* just before this script is done, you have to comfigure [[E17]] again.
# select "Deutsch" als language (then press next)
# select "paroli-serenity" as profile (then press next)
# select "systemstandard" as menüs (then press next)
# don't checkbox any applications in Quick Launch (then press next)
* now wait for the customize script to finish
* hopefully no errors have occured

== Test it ==
* reboot your neo, and let paroli settle down and login to your GSM network
* now navit should have austrian maps, and speak in german to you :-)
* date and time should also be correct

== Feedback ==
* please give some feedback, even if you don't like it

== Upgrade (for the brave) ==
* if you are brave you can try now
 opkg update
 opkg upgrade
