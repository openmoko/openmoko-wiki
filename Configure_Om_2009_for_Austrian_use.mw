--[[User:Zoff99|zoff99]] 08:23, 29 August 2009 (UTC)

== Installing ==
* have at least 1 hour of time ready, for the whole procedure
* have fast internet, you need to download lots of stuff
* download exactly these versions of '''[[Om 2009]]''' from z0ph
     '''1.''' [http://work.zoff.cc/openmoko/om2009/de_at/qi.udfu] qi boot loader

     '''2.''' [http://work.zoff.cc/openmoko/om2009/de_at/uImage-2.6.28.bin] kernel (kernöl)

     '''3.''' [http://work.zoff.cc/openmoko/om2009/de_at/rootfs.jffs2] root image


these are the original names of the files:
 qi-s3c2442-1.0.2+gitr3b8513d8b3d9615ebda605de4bda18371aa3f359.udfu

 fso-paroli-image-om-gta02.jffs2 (daily testing image from 16-Jun-2009 04:35   88M)

 uImage-2.6.28-stable+gitr0+f19f259d3c1afde8eae53983fd19f61831927413-r3-om-gta02.bin

* flash '''[[qi]]''', '''[[kernel]]''' and root image to your neo (i tested this on '''[[GTA02]]'''v6). Detailed instructions for [[Flashing_the_Neo_Freerunner|Freerunner]]

* download customize pack from z0ph
     '''4.''' [http://work.zoff.cc/openmoko/om2009/de_at/customize_pack.tar.gz] customize pack (400 MBytes)
* if you want it quick, you can instead download customize pack without navit maps, its much smaller

     '''5.''' [http://work.zoff.cc/openmoko/om2009/de_at/customize_pack_no_maps.tar.gz] customize pack without maps (50 MBytes)

to download (or update!!) the austrian map file later do (you need fast internet on your neo):
 cd /media/card/navit/
 ./get_austria.map.sh # this will download about 350 MBytes!!

* unpack the customize pack to your SD-Card (to /media/card). my /media/card partition is type VFAT

== Startup ==
* boot up your neo, and let it run until paroli has logged in to your GSM net
* then shutdown the neo (press and hold power button for a few seconds)
* boot up your neo again, and let paroli log in to your GSM network again.

== Localize for AT ==
* for '''GOD's sake try NOT to get any phonecalls''' while you do this part
* if at ANY time you get messages "'''Error loading Module''': would you like to unload this module, bla bla" just press "yes" !!
* if at ANY time you get messages "'''Fehler beim laden des Modules''': möchten sie dieses Modul abschalten, bla bla" just press "yes" !!
* now connect your neo with usb and login via ssh
* you '''NEED internet on your neo''' for this, otherwise dependent packages can't be downloaded
* start (as root on your neo):

 cd /media/card/
 ./init_om2009.sh

* this will take some time !! have coffee ready :-)
<strike>* just before this script is done, you have to comfigure [[E17]] again.</strike>
<strike># select "Deutsch" als language (then press next)</strike>
<strike># select "paroli-serenity" as profile (then press next)</strike>
<strike># select "systemstandard" as menüs (then press next)</strike>
<strike># don't checkbox any applications in Quick Launch (then press next)</strike>
<strike>* now wait for the customize script to finish</strike>
* now start (also as root on your neo):
 cd /media/card/
 do_opkg_upgrade.sh
* hopefully no errors have occured

== Test it ==
* reboot your neo, and let paroli settle down and login to your GSM network
* now navit should have austrian maps, and speak in german to you :-)
* date and time should also be correct

== Test it (german) ==
* Navit sollte alles in deutsch anzeigen, österreichkarten laden und vor allem der neo sollte beim laufen von Navit nicht blanken oder suspenden
