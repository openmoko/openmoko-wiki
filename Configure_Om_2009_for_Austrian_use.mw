== installing ==
* have at least 1 hour of time ready, for the whole procedure
* download exactly these versions of '''[[Om 2009]]''' from z0ph
'''1.''' qi[http://work.zoff.cc/openmoko/om2009/de_at/] boot loader

'''2.''' kernel[http://work.zoff.cc/openmoko/om2009/de_at/]

'''3.''' root image[http://work.zoff.cc/openmoko/om2009/de_at/]

* download customize pack[http://work.zoff.cc/openmoko/om2009/de_at/customize_pack.tar.gz] from z0ph
* if you want it quick, you can instead download customize pack[http://work.zoff.cc/openmoko/om2009/de_at/customize_pack_no_maps.tar.gz] without navit maps from z0ph
* fash '''[[qi]]''', '''[[kernel]]''' and root image to your neo (i tested this on '''[[GTA02]]'''v6)
* unpack the customize pack to your SD-Card (to /media/card). don't do this under windows!! or your execute bits will get lost (you have been warned)

== start up ==
* boot up your neo, and let it run until paroli has logged in to your GSM net
* then shout neo down (press and hold power button for a few seconds)
* boot up your neo again, and let paroli log in to your GSM network again.

== localize for AT ==
* now connect your neo with usb and login via ssh
* start (as root on your neo):

 cd /media/card/
 ./init_om2009.sh

this will take some time !! have coffee ready :-)
* hopefully no errors have occured

== test it ==
* reboot your neo
* have fun ;-)

== upgrade ==
* if you are brave you can try now
 opkg update
 opkg upgrade
