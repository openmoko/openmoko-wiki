== Overview ==
ZOMG! is a graphical package manager similar to assassin, but contrary to assassin it is not limited to Om2008.x and it features full package management (Beta version! tested on Om2008.9).
It's written in Java, so the startup time is... well you know.

Features:

* Install 
* Remove 
* Search for packages (in name and description)
* Update package database
* Upgrade System
* "Detailed" command line ouptut (standard verbosity level)
* As finger friendly as the om-gtk-theme can be 

== Prerequisites ==
(till i have made an *.opk)
cacao, classpath, classpath-gtk

See image ->
[[Image:Zomg_info.png|thumb| Zomg in installer Mode]]  

== Download ==
=== Release ===
<pre>
wget http://jmccloud.jm.funpic.de/inst_zomg.sh
chmod +x inst_zomg.sh
sh ./inst_zomg.sh
</pre>

=== Source ===
Will be made available when i finished optimizing the code.

== Note ==
It's i still in development and the code is rather nasty, so it is slow and pretends not to know anything about object oriented programming. give me some time to fix it - currently i have none. not even to pack it into an opk package. If someone wants to do it, please do it!
