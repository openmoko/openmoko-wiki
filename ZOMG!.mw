[[Image:Zomg.png|thumb| ZOMG! displaying the Installer tab]]
== Overview ==
ZOMG! is a graphical package manager similar to assassin, but contrary to assassin it is not limited to Om2008.x and it features full package management (Beta version! tested on Om2008.9).
It's written in Java, so the startup time is... well you know.

=== Features ===

* Install 
* Remove 
* Search for packages (in name and description)
* Update package database
* Upgrade System
* "Detailed" command line ouptut (standard verbosity level)
* As finger friendly as the om-gtk-theme can be ;)



== Usage ==
[[Image:Zomg_info.png|thumb| ZOMG! home screen]]
'''ZOMG!''' needs an internet connection to install applications for the repositories. This can be done via WiFi, USB, GPRS or Bluetooth. 

=== Features ===

* Install packages
* Remove packages
* Opkg upgrade
* Opkg update 
* Repo management

=== Instructions ===

* Installing packages
	Hit the '''''+''''' button at the bottom. The Installer screen will appear. You can either directly pick a package from the list or search for a package (in name an description) and pick it then. Hitting the '''''Install''''' button will install the selected package. If you dont want to use the default configuration for installing a package you can enable some command line options via the checkboxes.

* Removing packages
	Hit the '''''-''''' button at the bottom then proceed as you would at the Installer screen.

* Updating the database

	Hit the '''''Update''''' button at the home screen

* Upgrade system
	Hit the '''''^''''' button at the bottom

* Manage repositories
	Hit the '''''Repo''''' button at the home screen. The Repo Management screen will appear displaying you current feeds. You can remove a selected feed by hitting the remove button (for urther details about automated backup-ing see [[ZOMG!#Notes]]).
To edit a feed simply edit the corresponding text fields and hit '''''Save/Add'''''. Adding a new feed works the same.

=== Update 09/01/2009 ===
Packaged into an ipk package for *almost* hands-free installation.

== Download ==

=== Release ===

opk can be downloaded [http://www.opkg.org/package_96.html here]

=== Source ===
Will be made available when i finished optimizing and cleaning the code.

== Note ==
It's i still in development and the code is rather nasty, so it is slow and pretends not to know anything about object oriented programming. give me some time to fix it...

Dependencies: jamvm is a dependency, since it is much faster than cacao
