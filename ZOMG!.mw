[[Image:Zomg.png|thumb| ZOMG! displaying the Installer Screen]]
== Overview ==
ZOMG! is a graphical package manager similar to assassin, but contrary to assassin it is not limited to Om2008.x and it features full package management (Beta version! tested on Om2008.9).
It's written in Java, so the startup time is... well you know.

=== Features ===

* Install 
* Remove 
* Search for packages (in name and description)
* Update package database
* Upgrade System
* "Detailed" command line ouptut (standard verbosity level)
* As finger friendly as the om-gtk-theme can be ;)



== Usage ==

[[Image:Zomgrepo.png|thumb| ZOMG! Repository Managemnet Screen]]
'''ZOMG!''' needs an internet connection to install applications for the repositories. This can be done via WiFi, USB, GPRS or Bluetooth. 

=== Features ===

* Install packages
* Remove packages
* Opkg upgrade
* Opkg update 
* Repo management

=== Instructions ===

* Installing packages
	Hit the '''''+''''' button at the bottom. The Installer screen will appear. You can either directly pick a package from the list or search for a package (in name an description) and pick it then. Hitting the '''''Install''''' button will install the selected package. If you dont want to use the default configuration for installing a package you can enable some command line options via the checkboxes.

* Removing packages
	Hit the '''''-''''' button at the bottom then proceed as you would at the Installer screen.

* Updating the database

	Hit the '''''Update''''' button at the home screen

* Upgrade system
	Hit the '''''^''''' button at the bottom

* Manage repositories
	Hit the '''''Repo''''' button at the home screen. The Repo Management screen will appear displaying you current feeds. You can remove a selected feed by hitting the remove button (for further details about automated backup-ing see [[ZOMG!#Note | Notes]]).
To edit a feed simply edit the corresponding text fields and hit '''''Save/Add'''''. Adding a new feed works the same (The Save/Add button doesn't get enabled before every textbox is filled out).

Tested on Om 2008.x - works! Yay!

=== Update 20/12/2008 ===

*Fixes one annoying bug
*speeds up the whole thing due to optimized code
<s>'''NOTE:''' ZOMG! must be already installed to make the update work!

just replace zomg.jar with [http://jmccloud.jm.funpic.de/zomg.jar this one]:
<pre>
wget http://jmccloud.jm.funpic.de/zomg.jar
rm /usr/share/zomg/zomg.jar
mv zomg.jar /usr/share/zomg/zomg.jar
</pre></s>

=== Update 22/12/2008 ===

*More bugs Fixed
*Major overall code optimization
*Tested on JamVM... fast as '''HELL'''
*<s>Shellscript doesn't care anymore if you are using JamVM or Cacao - will use whichever is linked to /usr/bin/java</s>
*<s>To update simply re-run the installer script as described further down.</s>

=== Update 09/01/2009 ===
Packaged into an ipk package for *almost* hands-free installation.


=== Update 10/01/2009 ===
Introducing repository management - wooohoo!!11oneoneoneeleven.
Uploaded the new version to [[http://www.opkg.org/package_96.html opkg.org]]


=== Update 14/01/2009 ===
'''***IMPORTANT***'''

Fixed one critical bug which could break you opkg feeds (don't panic) if it happened it can easily be undone, by hand-checking the feeds you edited (The only way this could have happened to you is if you have edited the feed-title, but not the feed (file)name).

* Current version without bugfix is 0.0.6-r2 which can be found on [[http://www.opkg.org/package_96.html opkg.org]]

== Download ==

=== Release ===

opk can be downloaded [http://www.opkg.org/package_96.html here]

I know it's redundant but if you are using SHR/FSO please add the [[Users_Repositories#Jalimo|Jalimo repos]] if you want ZOMG! (or any other java se app) to work on SHR.

=== Source ===
Will be made available when i finished optimizing and cleaning the code.

== Note ==
It's i still in development and the code is rather nasty, so it is slow and pretends not to know anything about object oriented programming. give me some time to fix it...

Dependencies: jamvm is a dependency, since it is much faster than cacao

===Automated backup-ing ===
When removing a feed it doesn't get deleted it will be renamed to ''feed_file''.bak
Same applies to editing an existing feed. 
...safety first!
