The GTA01 uses the [http://u-boot.sourceforge.net/ u-boot] bootloader.

More information on u-boot can be found at [http://www.denx.de/wiki/DULG] and [http://linuxdevices.com/articles/AT5085702347.html].

However, the vanilla u-boot doesn't support many of the features that GTA01 needs, such as
* Support for boot from NAND flahs using [[S3C2410 Steppingstone]]
* Support for reading kernel/initrd from SD/Transflash
* Support for S3C2410 NAND flash
* Support for downloading programs via S3C2410 USB Device Controller
* Support to display bootup logo / status on S3C2410 Framebuffer

[[User:HaraldWelte]] is working on those issues, and in fact most of them have already been implemented.
