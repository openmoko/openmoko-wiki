== Phase0 Quick Start ==
* Make sure that your phone has had the battery and USB cable removed for at least 30 seconds.
* Connect the Neo (ie not Debug Board) to a Linux host with the USB cable.
* Hold in the AUX button on power-up to access the boot menu.
* Set the console to USB.
* Connect to /dev/ttyACM0 with a terminal program on the Linux host
* Note that the cdc_acm /dev/ttyACM0 access disappears as soon as the Neo boots, and is replaced by the cdc_ether usb0 network access.
* You're now at the bootloader prompt.
* Set the bootdelay uboot environment variable to -1 if you want it to always halt at the bootloader on power-up.

== General ==

The GTA01 uses the [http://u-boot.sourceforge.net/ u-boot] bootloader.

More information on u-boot can be found at 
* http://www.denx.de/wiki/DULG
* http://www.gumstix.org/tikiwiki/tiki-index.php?page=U-Boot
* http://linuxdevices.com/articles/AT5085702347.html

However, the vanilla u-boot doesn't support many of the features that GTA01 needs, such as
* Support for boot from NAND flash using [[S3C2410 Steppingstone]]
* Support for reading kernel/initrd from SD/Transflash
* Support for S3C2410 NAND flash
* Support for downloading programs via S3C2410 USB Device Controller
* Support to display bootup logo / status on S3C2410 Framebuffer

[[User:HaraldWelte]] is working on those issues, and in fact most of them have already been implemented.

== Bootloader source code ==

The current bootloader patches can be found at http://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/src/target/u-boot/patches/. 

Untar the sources, apply the patch.  run "make gta01bv3_config" (or gta01bv2_config, or whatever hardware revision you have), run "make".  You will get a resulting "u-boot.bin" image, which you can directly flash (either using existing bootloader or [[sjf2410-linux]]) into NAND.

== Bootloader binary ==

The latest bootloader binary builds can be found at http://buildhost.openmoko.org/tmp/deploy/images/ .  It should be written to the NAND flash address 0x00000000 (size 0x30000)

== Bootloader development ==

=== QT2410 ===
If you want to do bootloader development on the QT2410, it's easier to work with a bootloader image that can be downloaded via USB into RAM instead of flashing.

To do so, you need to edit the u-boot/include/configs/qt2410.h file, and change the "if 0" in Line 32 into a "if 1", then recompile with "make".

The resulting "u-boot.bin" is _NOT SUITABLE_ for NAND flash, but only for direct execution from within ram, e.g. by using the [[s3c2410_boot_usb]] program.

=== GTA01 ===

Doing bootloader development on the GTA01 is a bit more tricky.  first, we don't have any NOR flash.  Second, there is no other way to boot _but_ from NAND.  Therefore, we also don't have a USB downloader like the QT2410.

The main problem is:  The [[S3C2410 Steppingstone]] unconditionally copies the first 4k of flash into its internal SRAM.   That SRAM segment stays unconditionally mapped at physical address zero. How do we get around this

==== Using JTAG to boot from RAM ====

So how can we boot from RAM? We use JTAG / OpenOCD to

* reset and halt the cpu at PC=0
<pre>
> reset halt
target halted in ARM state due to debug request, current mode: Supervisor
cpsr: 0x400000d3 pc: 0x00000000
MMU: disabled, D-Cache: disabled, I-Cache: disabled
</pre>

* download a small piece of code for low-level SDRAM timing initialization (overwrite 4k SRAM of steppingstone)
<pre>
> load_binary /space/misc/gta01/u-boot.git/foo.bin 0            
downloaded 332 byte in 0s 21899us
</pre>

* assert a break point at address 0x33f80000 (which indicates that the low-level code has finished)
<pre>
> bp 0x33f80000 4 hw
breakpoint added at address 0x33f80000
</pre>

* run the code up to the break point
<pre>
> resume
Target 0 resumed
> Target 0 halted
target halted in ARM state due to breakpoint, current mode: Supervisor
cpsr: 0x600000d3 pc: 0x33f80000
MMU: disabled, D-Cache: disabled, I-Cache: enabled
</pre>

* download the u-boot RAM image to 0x33f80000
<pre>
> load_binary /space/misc/gta01/u-boot.git/u-boot.bin 0x33f80000
downloaded 135692 byte in 6s 567264us
</pre>

* resume processing
<pre>
> resume
Target 0 resumed
</pre>

At this point, the display backlight gets bright and we see the following familiar prompt on the serial console:
<pre>
U-Boot 1.1.6 (Jan 13 2007 - 23:44:23)

DRAM:  128 MB

*** Warning - bad CRC or NAND, using default environment

In:    serial

GTA01Bv2 # 
</pre>

== Creating bootable images ==

u-boot needs bootable images (such as kernels, but also initrd and others) in form of a so-called ''uImage''.  In order to create a ''uImage'' from e.g. a ''vmlinux'' kernel image, you can proceed as follows:

<pre>
objcopy -O binary -R .note -R .comment -S vmlinux linux.bin
gzip -9 linux.bin
u-boot/tools/mkimage -A arm -O linux -T kernel -C gzip -a 30008000 -e 30008000 -n "Kernel Image QT2410" -d linux.bin.gz uImage
</pre>

== Boot menu ==
[[Image:Neo1973 uboot menu.jpg|thumb|400px|u-boot boot menu on Neo1973]]

As of the Phase-0 release, our u-boot version now features an on-screen boot menu.

=== Accessing the boot menu ===

You can access the boot menu by pressing and holding the [[Neo1973 AUX button]] together with the power button while switching the phone on.

=== Using the boot menu ===

By pressing the [[Neo1973 AUX button]] you can cycle through the menu items.  Use the ''POWER'' button to select one item.

=== Adding items to the boot menu ===

You can add items to the boot menu by setting environment variables. The canonical form is ''menu_<number> <Title>: U-Boot-Commands''

For example the following command will add a boot menu entry that switches to autofast charging and turns off the backlight:
  setenv menu_6 Autofast-Charge and Backlight Off: neo1973 charger autofast\; neo1973 backlight off

== Bootloader prompt ==

=== Accessing the bootloader prompt ===
The bootloader prompt is available either on the serial console (via [[Debug Board]]), or as virtual USB Serial device (USB CDC_ACM).
Whether the serial port or usb i used depends on the u-boot environment variables '''stdin''', '''stdout''' and '''stderr'''.

Whether or not you use usbtty, the first couple of messages will always be displayed on the serial console.

The bootloader is currently configured to waid for three seconds.  If a key press on the '''stdin''' is received within those three seconds, auto-boot is aborted.

==== Using usbtty from Linux ====

Just by connecting the phone in u-boot mode to your Linux pc should make it detect a [[CDC ACM]] device, and you should get a new tty device called /dev/ttyACM0.  Use your favourite terminal emulator (minicom, cu, zc, screen ...) to access it like any other serial port. If you don't have a favorite, try just
 cu -l /dev/ttyACM0

First, you should try to check whether the USB device shows up in 'lsusb' while you're running in u-boot mode:

 # lsusb -d 1457:5119
 Bus 005 Device 079: ID 1457:5119  

Second, lets see some more details about the available endpoints and configurations:

Next, you can access it using your favourite terminal program.

Then, if the environment is not set correctly, you will need to use the current console (e.g. serial console) to set
<pre>
GTA01Bv2 # setenv stderr usbtty
GTA01Bv2 # setenv stdout usbtty
GTA01Bv2 # setenv stdin usbtty
</pre>

==== Typical u-boot prompt ====

<pre>

GTA01Bv3 #
</pre>

=== Commands on the bootloader prompt ===

==== Auto-boot ====

Auto-boot executes the command[s] specified in the ''bootcmd'' environment variable. The default configuration is:
<pre>
GTA01Bv3 # printenv
bootcmd=setenv bootargs ${bootargs_base} ${mtdparts}; nand read.e 0x32000000 kernel; bootm 0x32000000
</pre>

This basically tells us that it will load the content of the NAND partition '''kernel''' to memory address 0x32000000 and then try to boot it.  

==== Environment ====

u-boot is configured to manage a non-volatile environment that is stored in NAND flash.  You can use the commands to read/alter/store the environment in the following example:
<pre>
GTA01Bv2 # printenv
baudrate=115200
bootargs=rootfstype=jffs2 root=/dev/mtdblock4 console=ttySAC0,115200 console=tty0 loglevel=8 dyntick=enable lpj=252416
usbtty=cdc_acm
bootdelay=10
stdout=serial
stderr=serial
stdin=serial
mtdparts=mtdparts=neo1973-nand:0x00030000(u-boot),0x0000c000(u-boot_env),0x00200000(kernel),0x00130000(splash),0x03c94000(rootfs)
mtdids=nand0=neo1973-nand
bootargs_base=rootfstype=jffs2 root=/dev/mtdblock4 console=ttySAC0,115200 console=tty0 loglevel=8 dyntick=enable lpj=252416
bootcmd=setenv bootargs ${bootargs_base} ${mtdparts}; nand read.e 0x32000000 kernel; bootm 0x32000000
pcf50606_int1=0x40
filesize=160C000
partition=nand0,0
mtddevnum=0
mtddevname=u-boot

Environment size: 670/16380 bytes
GTA01Bv3 # setenv bootdelay 10
GTA01Bv3 # printenv bootdelay
bootdelay=10
GTA01Bv3 # saveenv
Saving Environment to NAND...
Erasing Nand...Writing to Nand... done
GTA01Bv3 # 
</pre>

Note: When setting multiple commands, e.g. for bootcmd, you need to escape the ';', for instance

<pre>
GTA01Bv3 # setenv bootcmd mmcinit\; ext2load mmc 0 0x32000000 uImage\; bootm 0x32000000
</pre>

==== MMC/SD ====

in order to initialize a MMC/SD card, you have to use the ``mmcinit'' command.
<pre>
GTA01Bv3 # mmcinit
trying to detect SD Card...
MMC found. Card desciption is:
Manufacturer ID = 58d564
HW/FW Revision = 3 8
Product Name = 21DN!@X�
Serial Number = 445303
Month = 5
Year = 2000
READ_BL_LEN=15, C_SIZE_MULT=7, C_SIZE=3197
size = 4208984064
GTA01Bv3 #
</pre>

afterwards, you can read ext2 filesystems like:
<pre>
GTA01Bv3 # ext2ls mmc 0
<DIR>       1024 .
<DIR>       1024 ..
<DIR>      12288 lost+found
         1544788 uImage
</pre>

==== NAND ====

<pre>
GTA01Bv3 # help nand
nand info                  - show available NAND devices
nand device [dev]     - show or set current device
nand read[.jffs2]     - addr off size
nand write[.jffs2]    - addr off size - read/write `size' bytes starting
    at offset `off' to/from memory address `addr'
nand erase [clean] [off size] - erase `size' bytes from
    offset `off' (entire device if not specified)
nand bad - show bad blocks
nand dump[.oob] off - dump page
nand scrub - really clean NAND erasing bad blocks (UNSAFE)
nand markbad off - mark bad block at offset (UNSAFE)
nand biterr off - make a bit error at offset (UNSAFE)
</pre>

===== Loading Kernel from NAND =====

<pre>
GTA01Bv3 # nand read 0x32000000 kernel

NAND read: device 0 offset 212992, size 2097152 ...  2097152 bytes read: OK

</pre>

===== Writing new bootloader to NAND =====

The following set of commands loads the file u-boot.bin from ext2/mmc and flashes it into the
bootloader flash partition:

<pre>
GTA01Bv3 # ext2load mmc 0 0x32000000 u-boot.bin
GTA01Bv3 # nand erase u-boot
GTA01Bv3 # nand write.e 0x32000000 u-boot ${filesize}
</pre>

===== Writing kernel to NAND =====

The following set of commands loads the file uImage from ext2/mmc and flashes it into the
kernel flash partition:

<pre>
GTA01Bv3 # ext2load mmc 0 0x32000000 uImage
GTA01Bv3 # nand erase kernel
GTA01Bv3 # nand write.e 0x32000000 kernel ${filesize}
</pre>

===== Writing rootfs to NAND =====

The following set of commands loads the file rootfs.jffs2 from ext2/mmc and flashes it into the
rootfs flash partition:

<pre>
GTA01Bv3 # ext2load mmc 0 0x32000000 rootfs.jffs2
GTA01Bv3 # nand erase rootfs
GTA01Bv3 # nand write.e 0x32000000 rootfs ${filesize}
</pre>

Please note that this will only work with root file system sizes that are smaller than the amount of memory above 0x32000000, which in the case of 64MB SDRAM is something like 32MB.

==== Neo1973 related commands ====

Our version of u-boot supports a couple of Neo1973 specific commands:
<pre>
GTA01Bv2 # help neo1973
neo1973 neo1973 info - display phone informantion
neo1973 power-off - switch off the phone
neo1973 charger status - display charger status
neo1973 charger autofast - enable automatic fast (500mA) charging
neo1973 charger !autofast - disable automatic fast (500mA) charging
neo1973 charger fast - enable fast (500mA) charging
neo1973 charger off - disable charging
neo1973 backlight (on|off) - switch backlight on or off
neo1973 vibrator (on|off) - switch vibrator on or off
</pre>

===== Power-off =====

Using
 neo1973 power-off

you can switch the device off from the bootloader prompt.

===== Battery charger related =====

For a detailed description of the charger basics, see [[Neo1973 Battery Charger]].

====== Inquiring the charger state ======

You can get the current charger status by issuing
 neo1973 charger status

The following modes are possible:

* idle - no charging
* trickle - FIXME
* pre - Slow (100mA) charging, works in hardware.
* fast_cccv - Fast (500mA) charging, using Constant-Current followed by Constant Voltage (Li-Ion)

====== Disabling battery charging ======

You can disable battery charging (until the next reboot) by issuing
 neo1973 charger off

====== Forcing fast charge ======

Using
 neo1973 charger fast
you can force the PMU to try to do a fast (500mA) charge of the battery. It will abort if the battery is in over temperature or some other error condition occurs.

====== Enabling / Disabling automatic fast charge ======

Autofast is a feature of the PCF50606 PMU.  It means that the fast_cccv mode will be automatically selected if a charger with suitable voltage is plugged in, and the battery not in over temperature condition.

{{warning|This is potentially dangerous.  Only enable autofast if you ARE SURE that you can draw 500mA from the USB connector.  This is the case with a wall outlet charger, or if you are attached to a self-powered hub or a desktop PC root hub.  Bus powered hubs and some laptops only provide 100mA on their USB ports and can thus not support fast charging}}

You can enable or disable autofast by 
 neo1973 charger autofast
and
 neo1973 charger !autofast
respectively.

===== Backlight =====

You can switch the backlight on and off by using
 neo1973 backlight on
and
 neo1973 backlight off
respectively.

===== Vibrator =====

You can switch the vibrator on and off by using
 neo1973 vibrator on
and 
 neo1973 vibrator off
respectively.

==== S3C2410 specific commands ====

<pre>
GTA01Bv2 # help s3c2410
s3c2410 speed get - display current PLL speed config
s3c2410 speed list - display supporte PLL speed configs
s3c2410 speed set - set PLL speed
GTA01Bv2 # s3c2410 speed list
50 MHz
101 MHz
202 MHz
266 MHz
GTA01Bv2 # s3c2410 speed get
FCLK = 202 MHz, HCLK = 101 MHz, PCLK = 50 MHz
GTA01Bv2 # s3c2410 speed set 101
GTA01Bv2 # s3c2410 speed get
FCLK = 101 MHz, HCLK = 50 MHz, PCLK = 50 MHz
</pre>

===== 266MHz clock =====

You can re-configure the [[S3C2410]] PLL to generate a 266 MHz core cpu clock (rather than the 200MHz default) by using
 GTA01Bv2 # s3c2410 speed set 266 
and
 GTA01Bv2 # s3c2410 speed set 202
respectively.

{{warning|The current hardware (as of GTA01Bv3) only runs stable at 266MHz if you do not attach anything (esp. the FPC / [[Debug Board]] to the Debug Port}}

==== TFTP on QT2410 ====

The QT2410 cs8900a Ethernet can be used to download images via network.

First, you have to make sure that ''ipaddr'', ''serverip'', ''ethaddr' and ''netmaskk'' are set correctly in the environment:

<pre>
QT2410 # printenv
ethaddr=00:01:02:03:04:05
netmask=255.255.255.0
ipaddr=192.168.100.100
serverip=192.168.100.1
</pre>


===== TFTP kernel download =====

<pre>

== Device Firmware Upgrade ==

Our version of u-boot also implements [[USB DFU]]. This can be useful to
load files and kernel for quick testing.

To find out whether your version of u-boot supports this, use the output of
 $ lsusb -v -d 1457:5119
while the phone is in u-boot mode.

If it supports DFU, you should see the following snippet towards the end of the output:
<pre>
    Interface Descriptor:
      bLength                 9
      bDescriptorType         4
      bInterfaceNumber        2
      bAlternateSetting       0
      bNumEndpoints           0
      bInterfaceClass       254 Application Specific Interface
      bInterfaceSubClass      1 Device Firmware Update
      bInterfaceProtocol      1 
      iInterface              0 
</pre>

For information on how to do firmware upgrades, please see [[dfu-util]].

=== Booting files over DFU ===

To load a file at memory address 0x32000000:
<pre>
dfu-util -a 0 -D fileToLoad -R
</pre>

After that, send 'bootm 0x32000000' to u-boot or 'bootelf 0x32000000' if
its an elf file.

Simple python script that can boot an ELF image - avoiding a ACM bug that breaks on large packets.

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/python
import sys
import os
import time

cmd1 = "neo backlight off\n"
cmd2 = "bootelf 0x32000000\n"

def output(tty, str):
    for x in str:
        tty.write(x)
        tty.flush()

if len(sys.argv) == 2:
    print "Loading %s..." % sys.argv[1]

    loadfile = "dfu-util -a 0 -D %s -R" % sys.argv[1]

    os.system(loadfile)

    time.sleep(3)

    tty = open("/dev/ttyACM0", "a")

    output(tty, cmd1)
    output(tty, cmd2)

    tty.close()
else:
    print "Usage: %s elffile" % sys.argv[0]
    print ""
    sys.exit(2)
</pre>
