This article describes the "quick start" procedure allowing to see the first output and actually use the GPS device in the command line mode, using the [[gllin]] driver.

After you download, scp and install the gllin_1.0+r350-r0_fic-gta01.ipk (or similar), it creates the folder 'gllin' in the root home. This folder contains the executable with the same name which starts the driver.

To get the output of this driver, read the file /tmp/nmeaNP (it is actually a pipe, not a file). The simplest way is to open another ssh connection to the phone and use cat:
 cat /tmp/nmeaNP
Type cat ''after'' you start the gllin, not before. The output from the GPS driver looks like
 $GPRMC,235946.99,V,,,,,,,120180,,,N*78
 $GPGSA,A,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,11.2,5.0,10.0*36
 $GPGGA,235946.99,,,,,00,00,5.0,,M,0.0001999,M,0.0020199,*57
 (and so on). 

The data are presented in [http://gpsinformation.org/dale/nmea.htm NMEA format] which gives a lot of data. From the practical point of view, only the following lines seem interesting:
