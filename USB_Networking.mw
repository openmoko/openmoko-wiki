= Neo1973 side =

By default Neo1973 has usb0 interface working due to Ethernet gadget (g_ether) compiled into kernel.

= Desktop side =

== Manual method ==

Modprobe usbnet module and configure usb0 interface:
<pre>
ifconfig usb0 192.168.0.200 netmask 255.255.255.0
</pre>

== Automatic method ==

Took from [http://www.hrw.one.pl/2007/03/22/hotpluging-usbnet/ Hotplugging usbnet] post by Marcin 'Hrw' Juszkiewicz.

Edit /etc/network/interfaces file (in Debian or similiar distros):
<pre>
allow-hotplug usb0
iface usb0 inet static
        address 192.168.0.200
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        network 192.168.0.0
        post-up iptables -A POSTROUTING -t nat -j MASQUERADE -s 192.168.0.0/24
        post-up echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
        post-up iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
</pre>

And now when you connect phone (which has 192.168.0.202 IP) it gets connection to world automatically.

= Connecting to phone =

Then <tt>ssh root@192.168.0.202</tt> with empty password to get into phone.
