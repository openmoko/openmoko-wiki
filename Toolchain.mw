= Introduction =

A toolchain is a set of tools that allows you to compile code. For OpenMoko, we have to differenciate the following use-cases:

# Developing a single application

For this, you should use a prebuilt toolchain from the OpenMoko project. Here you can find a recipe to get started with this toolchain leading you through a series of steps to compile a project and run it on your target device.

# System Integration and customizing a distribution

For this task, you should use [[OpenEmbedded]] which builds its own cross compiler during the bootstrapping/build process. System Integration and customizing a distribution is out of scope of this page.

= Downloading and installing the toolchain =

The prebuilt toolchain can be downloaded from [[http://downloads.openmoko.org/toolchains downloads.openmoko.org]].
