= Introduction =

A toolchain is a set of tools that allows you to compile code. For OpenMoko, we have to differenciate the following use-cases:

* Developing a single application

For this, you should use a prebuilt toolchain from the OpenMoko project. Here you can find a recipe to get started with this toolchain leading you through a series of steps to compile a project and run it on your target device.

* System Integration and customizing a distribution

For this task, you should use [[OpenEmbedded]] which builds its own cross compiler during the bootstrapping/build process. System Integration and customizing a distribution is out of scope of this page.

= Prerequisites = 

You should be reasonably familiar with Linux and its command line tools, have an x86-compatible computer with at least 1G of free disk space. You should have experience with compiling programs from source using your local compiler. The remainder of this document will also assume you have write access in your home directory (~) and </tt>/usr/local/<tt>. If this is not the case, please call your local administrator for help.

= Downloading and installing the toolchain =

The prebuilt toolchain can be downloaded from [[http://downloads.openmoko.org/toolchains downloads.openmoko.org]]:

 mkdir ~/sources
 cd ~/sources
 wget http://downloads.openmoko.org/development/openmoko-Snapshot-20071126-arm-linux-gnueabi-toolchain.tar.bz2

Next, you want to extract it on your filesystem. This toolchain is ''not'' relocatable, it needs to be installed into <tt>/usr/local/openmoko/</tt>:

 cd /
 tar xjvf ~/sources/openmoko-Snapshot-20071126-arm-linux-gnueabi-toolchain.tar.bz2

Finally, you need to alter the PATH variable so that the toolchain binaries in <tt>/usr/local/openmoko/arm/bin/<tt> can be found. You may want to do this in your <tt>.bashrc</tt> so that it gets done automatically. To do it manually:

 export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/openmoko/arm/bin/

= Using the toolchain to build a sample project  =

First, download the sample project and extract it into your filesystem:

 cd ~/sources
 wget http://downloads.openmoko.org/development/openmoko-Sample-Project-20071126.tar.bz2

 mkdir ~/coding
 cd ~/coding
 tar xjvf ~/sources/openmoko-Sample-Project-20071126.tar.bz2

Since this is the first time you configure the project, you need to call <tt>./autogen.sh</tt> instead of <tt>./configure</tt> to configure your sources.

 cd ~/coding/openmoko-Sample-Project-20071126
 ./autogen.sh
