= Introduction =

A toolchain is a set of tools that allows you to compile code. For OpenMoko, we have to differenciate the following use-cases:

# Developing a single application
# System Integration and Distribution Customization

== Developing a single application ==

For this, you should use a prebuilt toolchain from the OpenMoko project. The following is a recipe to get started with this toolchain leading you through a series of steps to compile a project and run it on your target device.

== System Integration and Distribution Customization ==

For this task, you should use [[OpenEmbedded]] which builds its own cross compiler during the bootstrapping/build process. System Integration and customizing a distribution is out of scope of this page.
