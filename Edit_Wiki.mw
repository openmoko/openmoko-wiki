People usually start editing a wiki by fixing small things, like obvious grammar and style mistakes. Then some move to larger contributions, perhaps fixing a broken reference, adding a missing item in a list, or updating an outdated paragraph. Don't worry about being incomplete or about fine-tuning the language. Wiki means "fast" in Hawa√Øan, so if you have any information to share, go for it !
