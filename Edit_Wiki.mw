The Openmoko Wiki is open. YOU can edit its content.

People usually start editing a wiki by fixing small things, like obvious grammar and style mistakes. If you spot one, click on the '''edit''' tab, [http://wiki.openmoko.org/index.php?title=Special:Userlogin&type=signup register] by creating an account on the wiki, and you are set up to share and help others.

If you are extra cautious or want to get familliar with the system, go to the [[Sandbox]] page. The [[Sandbox]] page is here for everybody to play in !

Then some people move to larger contributions, perhaps fixing a broken reference, adding a missing item in a list, or updating an outdated paragraph. Don't worry about being incomplete or about fine-tuning the language. Wiki means "fast" in Hawa√Øan, so if you have any information to share, go for it !
