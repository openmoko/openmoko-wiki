There are some well polished, shiny applications out there that do what they should and are reliable for actually ''using'' them, not only playing with them.

If you think an application should be added to this list, please open a thread on the om-community mailinglist first to discuss the app so that this list's quality stays high.

* [[Intone]]<br />Mplayer frontend
* [[TangoGPS]]<br />GPS application which uses maps from [http://openstreetmap.org Openstreetmap.org]
* [[Mokomaze]]<br />You know that game where you have a metal ball on a tiltable wooden board and have to get it to the finish avoiding holes? Here you are. Addictive!
