It is possible to plug and use a webcam on the [[Neo_FreeRunner|Freerunner]]. This is a very rough list of the steps required to do so with [[Debian]] Lenny installed.

The webcam used to perform this example is a Philips SPC620NC, using the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_video_device_class UVC]] driver.

The method described here is still rather ugly, feel free to improve it.

== Make it work on a PC ==

To be safe, you just first ensure the webcam works on a regular PC, and Linux in particular. This will minimise the problems you are likely to face (though it may not eliminate them altogether). The regular documentation applies:

* to [http://linux-uvc.berlios.de/ UVC-compliant webcams]

== Add video support to the kernel ==

The 2.6.24 kernel is provided without video input support enabled. There is a way to add the necessary modules without recompiling everything:

* download the source code for the kernel:
# wget http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.24.tar.bz2
* make sure you have bzip2 and development tools installed:
# apt-get install bzip2 gcc make libc6-dev libncurses5-dev
* uncompress it in /usr/src:
# cd /usr/src
# tar -xjvf $OLDPWD/linux-2.6.24.tar.bz2
* fix links bluntly in /lib/modules:
# ln -sf /usr/src/linux-2.6.24 /lib/modules/2.6.24/build
* initialize the kernel sources with the current configuration:
# cd /usr/src/linux-2.6.24
# gzip -dc /proc/config.gz > .config
# make oldconfig          # just say "n" to power management debugging support
* add video support:
# make menuconfig
Basically, look for "Device drivers", "Multimedia devices", then enable "Video For Linux", "Video For Linux API 1", "Video For Linux API 1 compatible Layer", "Video capture adapters" as modules. If the driver for your webcam is found in the kernel already, also enable it there.
* compile the relevant kernel modules:
# make drivers/media/video/v4l1-compat.ko
# make drivers/media/video/v4l2-common.ko
# make drivers/media/video/videodev.ko
* load the modules:
# insmod drivers/media/video/v4l1-compat.ko
# insmod drivers/media/video/v4l2-common.ko
# insmod drivers/media/video/videodev.ko
The errors encountered while loading modules can be obtained with the "dmesg" command. They are typically also logged in /var/log/messages.

== Compile the UVC driver ==

To obtain and compile the latest source tree for the driver:
# apt-get install subversion
# svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/linux-uvc/linux-uvc/trunk
# cd trunk/linux-uvc
# make

And if all goes well:
# insmod uvcvideo.ko

== Add the device node ==

In our case, the relevant device node was not created automatically. Here's how to do so:

# mkdir -p /dev/v4l
# mknod /dev/v4l/video0 c 81 0

== Plug the camera itself ==

The Freerunner needs to run in USB host mode in order to do this. A special USB cable (or gender changer) is necessary to do so.

Again, you can use the command "dmesg" to verify that the camera is properly recognized.

== Install and try a viewer ==

A good webcam test application is [http://www.quickcamteam.net/software/linux/v4l2-software/luvcview luvcview]. You can install and test it this way:
# apt-get install luvcview
# luvcview -f yuv -d /dev/v4l/video0

== Known problems ==

* the resolution was limited to 160x120 with our Philips SPC620NC
