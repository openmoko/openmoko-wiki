TangoGPS is a map application which can utilize Neo's built-in GPS to show your current location.

== Running tangoGPS on OM2008.8 ==

{{note|There may be other steps because I remember it took a while before my TangoGPS started working, but these are the only things I remember installing}}

From the freerunner connected to the internet:

  opkg install gpsd
  opkg install tangogps

If opkg complains about not being able to acquire a lock, try:

  pkill packagekit

To get gpsd working on the Freerunner you have to change the configuration according to [[Gpsd#GPS_on_GTA02]].
Then start gpsd by:

  /etc/init.d/gpsd start

Now you must power up the GPS-chip by opening the "Settings" application and setting the GPS entry to "on". Now you can run tangoGPS and wait until it get's a GPS fix. This can take up to a few minutes.

I think TangoGPS may have started working after I followed the instructions to get GPRS working with GSM multiplexing here: [[Manually_using_GPRS#Option_1:_With_GSM_multiplexing_and_with_a_GUI]]

There are steps included in those instructions to improve GPS performance.  The great thing is that once you get GPRS working, you can roam with TangoGPS running and have it download maps as needed over the GPRS connection!
