TangoGPS is a map application which can utilize Neo's built-in GPS to show your current location.

== Running tangoGPS on [[Om 2008.8]] ==

From the freerunner connected to the internet:

  opkg install gpsd 
{{note|I experienced hangups if gpsd was not installed.}}
  opkg install http://www.tangogps.org/downloads/tangogps_0.9.3-r1_armv4t.ipk

If opkg complains about not being able to acquire a lock, try:

  pkill packagekit

To get gpsd working on the FreeRunner you have to change the configuration according to [[Gpsd#GPS_on_GTA02]].
Then start gpsd by:

  /etc/init.d/gpsd start

If you get an error about no GPS device in /etc/default/gpsd execute:

  echo "GPS_DEV=\"/dev/ttySAC1\"" > /etc/default/gpsd

Now you must power up the GPS-chip by opening the "Settings" application and setting the GPS entry to "on". Now you can run tangoGPS and wait until it get's a GPS fix. This can take up to a few minutes.

== Running TangoGPS on [[debian]] ==

Tangogps is a very nice GPS mapping application.  The latest version is available in [[Debian]].

It depends on gpsd which conflicts with frameworkd in fso-frameworkd, but there is a package available that provides
the gpsd interface to clients while using the services of the FSO frameworkd daemon, fso-gpsd. To install tangogps run

 # apt-get install fso-gpsd tangogps

To turn the gps on, you have two options.
You can start the gps application in [[Zhone]], this will turn on the gps device for you or you can manually turn
on the gps device using
  # echo 1 >/sys/devices/platform/s3c2440-i2c/i2c-adapter/i2c-0/0-0073/neo1973-pm-gps.0/pwron

'''Issues:'''
* Both gpsd and the framework publish GPS data through dbus, though with different interfaces.  This suggests a number of possible solutions.
** gpsd or the framework could implement the other's interface (along with their own).
** a translator could read one interface and emulate the other. This is what fso-gpsd does.
** the framework could have an option to read data from gpsd.
** opgsd/gypsy could be extended to be backwards compatible with the majority of gps applications.

== Downloading Maps for offline use ==
tangoGPS can bunch-download the map images so you don't need an internet connection while walking around. By default tangoGPS stores downloaded maps to /tmp/. This folder is lost every time you reboo the device. But you can use the "Config" tab within tangoGPS to change the "Cache Dir" location to , for example, /osm/ . So downloaded maps will be kept in the Neos flash, also after reboot. Note that the map files can take up large amounts of space, so you may want to store them on your sd card, in /media/card/osm.

If you find that TangoGPS does not remember configuration changes that you make to it, be sure to run it from the touchscreen, and not an SSH session.  TangoGPS uses gconf to store its settings, and cannot access gconf when run via SSH.

Once you have set the location to a non-volatile path, you can connect your Neo to the internet by USB or WiFi at home and start downloading the maps of your area. Tap the map screen and select "map download". Now on-the-road  tangoGPS will be able to show you maps in different zoom levels even though you are not connected to the internet.

== Downloading Maps via GPRS ==
I think TangoGPS may have started working after I followed the instructions to get GPRS working with GSM multiplexing here: [[Manually_using_GPRS#Option_1:_With_GSM_multiplexing_and_with_a_GUI]]

There are steps included in those instructions to improve GPS performance.  The great thing is that once you get GPRS working, you can roam with TangoGPS running and have it download maps as needed over the GPRS connection!

== Using TangoGPS to create tracks for OpenStreetMap.org ==

TangoGPS works fine to create track for Openstreetmap. However, it records and stores a track in its native format, use [http://www.tangogps.org/downloads/convert2gpx.pl] (see also: [http://psung.blogspot.com/2008/07/sharing-gps-tracks-from-tangogps-on.html tools]  to convert the track to GPX (i.e to import into JOSM):

    perl convert2gpx.pl 20080903_111508.log > 20080903_111508.gpx

== Importing Tracks into TangoGPS ==

TangoGPS does not support the import of tracks. You may help yourself by using [http://relet.net/frog/archives/68 this tool] to import GPX trackpoints as a series of POIs directly into the sqlite database which tangoGPS uses to store POIs.

== Using Google Maps with TangoGPS ==

Go to Config and change the url to http://mt1.google.com/mt?&x=%d&y=%d&zoom=%d and check the "Inverted Zoom" box. Press save Repository Configuration and you're ready to go.
:Automated map download will most certainly fail after a certain period of time, as Google is very keen on keeping leechers out.
:It did work for me...
