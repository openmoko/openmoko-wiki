TangoGPS is a map application which can utilize Neo's built-in GPS to show your current location.

== Running tangoGPS on OM2008.8 ==

{{note|There may be other steps because I remember it took a while before my TangoGPS started working, but these are the only things I remember installing}}

From the freerunner connected to the internet:

  opkg install gpsd
  opkg install tangogps

If opkg complains about not being able to acquire a lock, try:

  pkill packagekit

I think TangoGPS may have started working after I followed the instructions to get GPRS working with GSM multiplexing here: [[Manually_using_GPRS#Option_1:_With_GSM_multiplexing_and_with_a_GUI]]

There are steps included in those instructions to improve GPS performance.  The great thing is that once you get GPRS working, you can roam with TangoGPS running and have it download maps as needed over the GPRS connection!
