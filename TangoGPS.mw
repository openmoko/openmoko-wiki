TangoGPS is a map application which can utilize Neo's built-in GPS to show your current location.

== Running tangoGPS on OM2008.8 ==

{{note|There may be other steps because I remember it took a while before my TangoGPS started working, but these are the only things I remember installing}}

From the freerunner connected to the internet:

  opkg install gpsd
  opkg install tangogps

If opkg complains about not being able to acquire a lock, try:

  pkill packagekit
