Welcome to the OpenMoko page devoted to MacOS X users!

Here you can find notes of using Neo1973 (and maybe other OM devices) with Mac.

= Flashing to your device =
To operate the Phase 1 devices, you need to flash a root file system first.

Here is a detailled instruction:
#. download AJZaurusUSB-0.5.2 from http://www.dsitri.de/wiki.php?page=AJZaurusUSB&referer=OpenMoko%20Flasher
#. install
#. reboot your Mac so that the driver becomes active
(you do not yet need to configure the network interface)
#. download OpenMoko Flasher from http://www.dsitri.de/wiki.php?page=OpenMoko%20Flasher&referer=OpenMoko%20Flasher
#. press the Refresh button (which loads the list of packages on the server)
#. select and load the rootfs (takes some minutes for approx. 40 MByte)
#. open the Console application and show the console.log
#. Now, on your OpenMoko, hold the AUX button while pressing the Power button for 5 seconds
#. the BOOT menu should appear
#. connect the USB cable
#. Flash
#. the BOOT menu screen on the OM should show an indication that it has been switched to DFU mode
#. if it fails (console.log should show the reasons), unplug the OpenMoko shortly and replug
#. if it successfully flashed, you should be able to boot the OpenMoko and continue configuring AJZaurusUSB

= Connecting to your device =

== USB ==

You can telnet, SSH, SMB or do whatever you want if you install software that enables you to set up TCP/IP network over your USB connection. MacOS X does not provide such a driver for RNDIS/Ethernet Gadget. A universal driver for devices like the OpenMoko coming from the Linux on iPAQ and Sharp Zaurus projects is http://www.dsitri.de/wiki.php?page=AJZaurusUSB Download it and install according to manual found inside of the package.

Up to and including release 0.5.1 you need to patch the following file (before rebooting!) /System/Library/Extensions/AJZaurusUSB.kext/Contents/Info.plist

<pre>
		<key>OpenMoko</key>
		<dict>
			<key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>
			<string>net.lucid-cake.driver.AJZaurusUSB</string>
			<key>IOClass</key>
			<string>net_lucid_cake_driver_AJZaurusUSB</string>
			<key>IOProbeScore</key>
			<string>90000</string>
			<key>IOProviderClass</key>
			<string>IOUSBDevice</string>
			<key>defaultIP</key>
			<string>192.168.0.202</string>
			<key>idProduct</key>
			<integer>20770</integer>
			<key>idVendor</key>
			<integer>5207</integer>
		</dict>
</pre>

After reboot, you should have a new ethernet interface in your System Prefereces. Set up the network manually for that interface and then set up your network manualy on the Neo1973. You should be able to connect to your Neo! Try using ping.

= Synchronizing =

This is not done yet. Possible solutions are SyncML or http://www.dsitri.de/wiki.php?page=ZMacSync

= Sharing connection =

== Mac as a server ==

Here is described how to enable your Mac to serve as a internet router for your OpenMoko device.

=== Bluetooth ===

This could help: http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20051220221237711

=== USB ===

If you install AJZaurusUSB driver you should be able to set up your Mac as a router (not tested).

== Neo1973 as a server ==

To Be Done.

= Developing software =

== Using virtualization software==

You can use Parallels or VMWare to install your favourite Linux distribution and then develop just as on Linux.

There are some drawback since AFAIK dfu-util may not work correctly in such environments.

== Natively ==

There are some efforts to get through process of compiling OE and OpenMoko under mac: [[OpenMoko_under_QEMU_on_MacOSX]]
