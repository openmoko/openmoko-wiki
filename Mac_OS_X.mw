Welcome to the OpenMoko page devoted to MacOS X users!

Here you can find notes of using Neo1973 (and maybe other OM devices) with Mac.

= Flashing to your device =
To operate the Phase 1 devices, you need to flash a root file system first.

This can be done by dfu-util manually. A precompiled version (Universal Binary for OS X 10.4) can be found here: -link to be provided-

There is (well, will be) a OpenMoko Flasher application that wraps dfu-util with a nice GUI.

= Connecting to your device =

== USB ==

You can telnet, SSH, SMB or do whatever you want if you install software that enables you to set up TCP/IP network over your USB connection. MacOS X does not provide such a driver for RNDIS/Ethernet Gadget. A universal driver for devices like the OpenMoko coming fro the Linux on iPAQ and Sharp Zaurus projects is http://www.dsitri.de/wiki.php?page=AJZaurusUSB Download it and install according to manual found inside of the package.

Up to release 0.5.1 you need to patch the following file (before rebooting!) /System/Library/Extensions/AJZaurusUSB.kext/Contents/Info.plist

		<key>OpenMoko</key>
		<dict>
			<key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>
			<string>net.lucid-cake.driver.AJZaurusUSB</string>
			<key>IOClass</key>
			<string>net_lucid_cake_driver_AJZaurusUSB</string>
			<key>IOProbeScore</key>
			<string>90000</string>
			<key>IOProviderClass</key>
			<string>IOUSBDevice</string>
			<key>defaultIP</key>
			<string>192.168.0.202</string>
			<key>idProduct</key>
			<integer>20770</integer>
			<key>idVendor</key>
			<integer>5207</integer>
		</dict>


After reboot, you should have a new ethernet interface in your System Prefereces. Set up the network manually for that interface and then set up your network manualy on the Neo1973. You should be able to connect to your Neo! Try using ping.

== Telnet, ssh, SMB ==

To Be Done.

== Bluetooth ==

== WiFi ==

To Be Done.

= Synchronizing =

This is not done yet. Possible solutions are SyncML or http://www.dsitri.de/wiki.php?page=ZMacSync

= Sharing connection =

== Mac as a server ==

Here is described how to enable your Mac to serve as a internet router for your OpenMoko device.

=== Bluetooth ===

This could help: http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20051220221237711

=== USB ===

If you install AJZaurusUSB driver you should be able to set up your Mac as a router (not tested).

== Neo1973 as a server ==

To Be Done.

= Developing software =

== Using virtualization software==

You can use Paralels or VMWare to install your favourite Linux distribution and then develop just as on Linux.

There are some drawback since AFAIK dfu-util may not work correctly in such environments.

== Natively ==

There are some efforts to get through process of compiling OE and OpenMoko under mac: [[OpenMoko_under_QEMU_on_MacOSX]]
