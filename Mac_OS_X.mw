Welcome to the OpenMoko page devoted to MacOS X users!

Here you can find notes of using Neo1973 (and maybe other OM devices) with Mac.

= Connecting to your device =

== USB ==

You can telnet, SSH, SMB or do whatever you want if you install software that enables you to set up TCP/IP network over your USB connection. The only driver I know is http://www.dsitri.de/wiki.php?page=AJZaurusUSB Download it and install according to manual foung inside of the package. 

You should have new ethernet interface in your System Prefereces. Set up network manually for that interface and then set up your network manualy on the Neo1973. You should be able to connect to your Neo!

== Bluetooth ==

To Be Done.

== WiFi ==

To Be Done.

= Synchronizing =

This is not done yet. Possible solutions are SyncML or http://www.dsitri.de/wiki.php?page=ZMacSync

= Sharing connection =

== Mac as a server ==

Here is described how to enable your Mac to serve as a internet router for your OpenMoko device.

=== Bluetooth ===

This could help: http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20051220221237711

=== USB ===

If you install AJZaurusUSB driver you should be able to set up your Mac as a router (not tested).

== Neo1973 as a server ==

To Be Done.

= Developing software =

== Using virtualization software==

You can use Paralels or VMWare to install your favourite Linux distribution and then develop just as on Linux.

There are some drawback since AFAIK dfu-util may not work correctly in such environments.

== Natively ==

There are some efforts to get through process of compiling OE and OpenMoko under mac: [[OpenMoko_under_QEMU_on_MacOSX]]
