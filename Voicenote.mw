This page is a draft description / to-do list for my 1st application "voicenote"

= Voicenote =
[[Image:Voicenote.png]]
== Presentation ==
'''Voicenote''' is a software which allows to record any sound from the microphone into a wav file. It is intended to be an easy and quick way to do so.

It is based on the '''arecord''' / aplay librairy and use the alsactl to change the audio scenario ( /usr/share/openmoko/scenarios/voip-handset.state restore is used)

== Installation ==

=== Dependencies ===
You need zenity and alsa-utils-aplay to make it work. 

=== OM / SHR ===

So to install it, you can do :
 opkg install http://buildhost.automated.it/OM2007.2/packages/armv4t/zenity_2.20.1-r0_armv4t.ipk alsa-utils-aplay http://www.opkg.org/packages/voicenote_0.1_arm.ipk


For SHR user, you might use the -force-depends option to avoid the error with gtk+fastscaling

=== Debian base distributions ===
I have not made a package yet. So if you want to try it, you have to use the script alone :
 apt-get install zenity alsa-utils-aplay
 cd ~
 wget http://kimaidou.kilu.de/openmoko/voicenote/voicenote.sh
 chmod +x voicenote.sh
To launch it, do
 cd ~
 ./voicenote.sh

== Using voicenote ==
* Click on the desktop icon [[Image:Voicenote.png|30px]] called "Voicenote" to load the software
* '''1st window'''
 Click Validate to start recording.
 Then wait for the next window to start speaking
You validate then wait for the 2nd window to show up before talking to your phone
* '''2nd window:'''
 Click Validate to STOP recording
Just click when you have recorded what you want
* '''3rd window:'''
 Your voice-note has been recorded under the filename
It just confirms that the voice note has been recorded, and display the name of the file.

For now, '''the wav files are saved in the ~/ folder''', with a "voicenote_" prefix and the date and time (YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MI) 

For example: '''voicenote_2009-02-20_12-34.wav''' means a this voice note has been recorded at 12:34 the 20th of feb 2009.

== Changelog ==
=== 2009-02-19 - v0.1  ===
initial version


== Futur improvement / To do list ==
* add the GPL license
* add a README text file
* package it for debian
* add the GPS date and time information (+/- latitude and longitude) so that each wav file can be used for OpenStreetMap mapping.
* allow the user to choose the microphone source (headset or handset)
* config file to choose the target folder and the filename (+ other things)
* find a solution to double the sound to the left side (it is now in mono, but only on the right)
* propose an after (or real-time) ogg compression to save space. (any idea ?)
* a front-end listing all the recorded voice notes, with a button to play one of them
* more language
* replace zenity by a real frontend as EFL ?
