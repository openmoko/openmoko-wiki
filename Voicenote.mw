This page is a draft description / to-do list for my 1st application "voicenote"

= Voicenote 0.3=
[[Image:Voicenote.png]]
== Presentation ==
'''Voicenote''' is a script which allows to record any sound from the microphone into a wav file. It can play the created files too. It is intended to be an easy and quick way to do so.

It is based on the '''arecord''' / aplay librairy and use the '''alsactl''' to change the audio scenario ( /usr/share/openmoko/scenarios/voip-handset.state restore is used) .

It uses '''zenity''' as a basic graphical gui.

== Installation ==

=== Dependencies ===
You need '''zenity''' and '''alsa-utils-aplay''' to make it work.

=== OM / SHR ===

So to install it, you can do :
 opkg install http://buildhost.automated.it/OM2007.2/packages/armv4t/zenity_2.20.1-r0_armv4t.ipk alsa-utils-aplay http://kimaidou.kilu.de/openmoko/voicenote/voicenote_0.3_arm.ipk

For SHR user, you might use the -force-depends option to avoid the error with gtk+fastscaling

=== Debian base distributions ===
I have not made a package yet. So if you want to try it, you have to use the script alone :
 apt-get install zenity alsa-utils-aplay
 cd ~
 wget http://kimaidou.kilu.de/openmoko/voicenote/voicenote
 chmod +x voicenote
To launch it, do
 cd ~
 ./voicenote

== Using voicenote ==
* Click on the desktop icon [[Image:Voicenote.png|30px]] called "Voicenote" to load the software
* '''1st window'''
 Click Validate to start recording.
 Then wait for the next window to start speaking
You validate then wait for the 2nd window to show up before talking to your phone
* '''2nd window:'''
 Click Validate to STOP recording
Just click when you have recorded what you want
* '''3rd window:'''
 Your voice-note has been recorded under the filename
It just confirms that the voice note has been recorded, and display the name of the file.

For now, '''the wav files are saved in the ~/ folder''', with a "voicenote_" prefix and the date and time (YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MI) 

For example: '''voicenote_2009-02-20_12-34.wav''' means a this voice note has been recorded at 12:34 the 20th of feb 2009.
