This page is a draft description / to-do list for my 1st application "voicenote"

= Voicenote 0.3=
[[Image:Voicenote.png]]
== Presentation ==
'''Voicenote''' is a script which allows to record any sound from the microphone into a wav file. It can play the created files too. It is intended to be an easy and quick way to do so.

It is based on the '''arecord''' / aplay librairy and use the '''alsactl''' to change the audio scenario ( /usr/share/openmoko/scenarios/voip-handset.state restore is used) .

It uses '''zenity''' as a basic graphical gui.

== Installation ==

=== Dependencies ===
You need '''zenity''' and '''alsa-utils-aplay''' to make it work.

=== OM / SHR ===

So to install it, you can do :
 opkg install http://buildhost.automated.it/OM2007.2/packages/armv4t/zenity_2.20.1-r0_armv4t.ipk alsa-utils-aplay http://kimaidou.kilu.de/openmoko/voicenote/voicenote_0.3_arm.ipk

For SHR user, you might use the -force-depends option to avoid the error with gtk+fastscaling

=== Debian base distributions ===
I have not made a package yet. So if you want to try it, you have to use the script alone :
 apt-get install zenity alsa-utils-aplay
 cd ~
 wget http://kimaidou.kilu.de/openmoko/voicenote/voicenote
 chmod +x voicenote
To launch it, do
 cd ~
 ./voicenote

== Using voicenote ==
* Just click on the desktop icon [[Image:Voicenote.png|30px]] called "Voicenote" to load the software

* Then you have to choose between recording or playing a voice note (a wav file). When finished recording or playing, you go back to this first window. Click "Cancel" to quit the application.

* For now the wav files are saved with a "voicenote_" prefix and the date and time (YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MI). For example: '''voicenote_2009-02-20_12-34.wav''' means a this voice note has been recorded at 12:34 the 20th of feb 2009.

== Changelog ==
=== 2009-02-25 - v0.3 ===
* Now you can play the wav files from Voicenote

* the wave file is now recorded in mono at 8000 kHz (which saves a lot of CPU and bytes)
* addition of comments in the script
* the script is called "voicenote", and not anymore "voicenote.sh"

=== 2009-02-19 - v0.1 ===

== Future improvements / To do list ==
