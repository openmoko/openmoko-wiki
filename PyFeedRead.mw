== Overview ==
Little Python tool to read text only RSS feeds. Developed as a proof of concept and by special request it has no intention to replace the [[Feed Reader]].
The initial project goal was to see what can be done in 3 hours of Python programming (see [http://mput.de/~kristian/.openmoko/pyFeedRead-0.1.tar.gz Version 0.1] for the result).
