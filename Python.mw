'''Python''' is a programming language which is applicable to scripting phone functionalities and graphical user interfaces. Currently, at least [[SettingsGUI]] and [[SMSTool]] use it. There is also [[Python ncurses]] for character user interfaces. [[Manually using Bluetooth]] is partially based on using Python.

== Environment ==

Source packages for Python contained in [[OpenEmbedded]] include: 
 python python-pygtk python-pycairo python-pygobject

Binary packages for Python are not officially built yet but at least ScaredyCat's [[repositories]] provide them: 
 python-core python-misc python-lang python-subprocess python-threading 

Graphical applications need the following binary packages too: 
 python-pygtk python-pycairo python-pygobject

{{note|These packages take up a considerable amout of space (several megabytes). Make sure that you have enough free space or install the packages to the media card as explained in [[package management]].}}
