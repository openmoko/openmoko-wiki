'''Python''' is a programming language which is applicable to scripting phone functionalities and graphical user interfaces. Currently, at least [[SettingsGUI]], [[SMSTool]] and [http://pavelmachek.livejournal.com/42672.html MokoMenu] use it. There is also [[Python ncurses]] for character user interfaces. [[Manually using Bluetooth]] is partially based on using Python.

== Environment ==

Source packages for Python contained in [[OpenEmbedded]] include: 
 python python-pygtk python-pycairo python-pygobject python-dbus

Binary packages for Python are not officially built yet but at least ScaredyCat's [[repositories]] provide them: 
 python-core python-misc python-lang python-subprocess python-threading etc.

Graphical applications need the following binary packages too: 
 python-pygtk python-pycairo python-pygobject

{{note|These packages take up a considerable amount of space (several megabytes). Make sure that you have enough free space or install the packages to the media card as explained in [[package management]].}}

=== Missing ===

Parts of the OpenMoko platform are not available in python yet, including gconf and evolution data server. python-openmoko is in the works for [[gsmd]] access etc. A recipe for PyWebKitGtk
is at [http://bugs.openembedded.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3028 OpenEmbedded bug #3028].

== Simple Example Scripts ==
=== Minimal GTK gui ===
 import gtk
 
 #create a (nonvisible) window 
 w = gtk.Window()
 
 #create a button (not yet on any window)
 b = gtk.Button('Hello')
 
 #put the button on the window
 w.add(b)
 
 #create a silly callback function
 def hello(target):
   print 'Hello world'
   exit()
 
 #make the button call the callback when pressed
 b.connect('clicked', hello)
 
 #make the window display
 w.show_all()
 
 #start processing screen events
 gtk.main()
