==Introduction==

An openmoko device could act as '''the perfect geeky swiss knive''': go anywhere with your Linux desktop and tools.

When the openmoko device is in mass storage mode, a host computer should be able to boot on it, presenting a grub menu offering to boot into several images / partitions (payloads) on the transflash: memtest, UBCD (the ultimate boot cd), a lightweight security oriented livecd distro, you name it... 

It's sometimes called Live USB: from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_USB Wikipedia LiveUSB definition], ''A live USB is a USB flash drive containing a full operating system which can be booted from. Live USBs are closely related to Live CDs, and are sometimes used interchangeably. Like Live CDs, Live USBs can be used for system administration, data recovery, or the testing of operating system distributions without committing to a permanent installation on the local hard drive. Many of the smaller Linux distributions can also be used from a USB flash drive.''

Usually, all you need for this with an USB storage device (flash USB stick or external drive) is a partition, flagged "bootable" (see fdisk), containing a boot loader (say grub). But the problem is that specifications vary between motherboards, so there are variants and mandatory requirements to define (here would be a good idea), so that one can optimize/maximize the compatibility.

==TODO==

Testing/further research has to be conducted to determine:
* if a bootable-flagged partition / grub doesn't mess openmoko up
* if the phone can still act as a phone, or if the booted os can use the gprs functions
* if the phone can recharge on mass storage mode (from the usb cable)
* if a dedicated partition for each payload is needed (see memtest example...)
* if multi-boot is possible: grub?
* isn't there a method to boot directly on an iso file? This would be the best option (no need for special partitioning) - preliminary answear: NO, except using knoppix-like bootfrom cheat code, which needs that the iso uses the same kernel version.... So, NO :(

Similar functionality can be found in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizpy the Wizpy portable media player]

==Transflash partitioning schema example==

* 2 Gb: /dev/sd? (where N is the transflash's number)
* 700 Mb: /dev/sd?1 : containing bootable iso, FAT16
* 1300 Mb: /dev/sd?2 : openmoko & bootable os home partition, EXT3?
* eventually a swap

That way, one can install a new iso when it's released. An updater script shall be written.

==Linux distro Howto==

Summary: When the neo/openmoko device is connected in mass storage mode to a linux host,
# Partition the transflash into livecd (bootable flag) & home partition
# Format the created partitions
# Extract the iso's contents onto the livecd partition
# Rename isolinux.cfg and edit it syslinux.cfg (see ubuntu tutorial link)
# Make the partition bootable using syslinux:
    $ sudo syslinux -f /dev/sd?

==Memtest86+==

Grub example (from stock /boot/grub/menu.lst ubuntu install):

    title           Ubuntu, memtest86+
    root            (hd0,2)
    kernel          /memtest86+.bin
    quiet
    boot
