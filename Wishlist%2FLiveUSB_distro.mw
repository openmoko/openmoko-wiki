==Introduction==

NOTE: this page may be renamed: portable destkop

An openmoko device could act as '''the perfect geeky swiss knive''': go anywhere with your Linux desktop and tools.

YES, there are tons of liveCDs out there, but CDs/DVDs:
* get easily damaged
* don't fit in a pocket (except for businesscard-sized ones ; too exotic...)
* don't update or save settings/personal data without a supplementary USB device

YES, there are LiveUSB distros but:
* a Neo/OpenMoko device IS sort of an USB stick; one object is better than two
* you may carry my cellphone everywhere, what about usb sticks or cds ?

The biggest argument against these ones is that you'd have to carry an USB cable with you... But it's a standard one, which is good news :) An integrated zippable plug could be an interesting add-on...

Similar functionality can be found in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizpy the Wizpy portable media player], but relies on different methods for working under Windows (cd-rom emulation).

When the openmoko device is in mass storage mode, a host computer should be able to boot on it, presenting a grub menu offering to boot into several images / partitions (payloads) on the transflash: memtest, UBCD (the ultimate boot cd), a lightweight security oriented livecd distro, you name it... 

It's sometimes called Live USB: from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_USB Wikipedia LiveUSB definition], ''A live USB is a USB flash drive containing a full operating system which can be booted from. Live USBs are closely related to Live CDs, and are sometimes used interchangeably. Like Live CDs, Live USBs can be used for system administration, data recovery, or the testing of operating system distributions without committing to a permanent installation on the local hard drive. Many of the smaller Linux distributions can also be used from a USB flash drive.''

Usually, all you need for this with an USB storage device (flash USB stick or external drive) is a partition, flagged "bootable" (see fdisk), containing a boot loader (say grub). But the problem is that specifications vary between motherboards, so there are variants and mandatory requirements to define (here would be a good idea), so that one can optimize/maximize the compatibility.

==The perfect geek knife==

We may want to start our own distro with the following constraints:
* Multiboot: small utilities/compilations + bull blown light OS
* Aiming at maximum hardware compatibility, possibly using liveCD technology (knoppix-based distros)
* Aiming at minimum resource+system footprint, and boot speed
* Being able to install software temporary (for the session) or permanently, upgradable
* Being able to use the phone features at the same time (access pim, data & calls)

Optimally, being able to charge the device while plugged in would be great too.

==About USB Booting==

From [http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/wiki/index.php/USB_Booting DSL Wiki]:

Older computer BIOS usually do not support direct booting from a USB device. Around 2001, PC motherboard manufacturers started to add USB boot support.

There are two common BIOS methods for direct USB booting:
* One method is called the "USBHDD" method and it is used to support the booting of standard USB mass storage devices that are configured like a normal PC hard drive.
* The other method is called the "USBZIP" method and it supports booting from a USB storage device that behaves like the original IOMEGA ZIP drive with USB support. 

Most computers (just about all Dells, for example) made today have a BIOS that supports the USBHDD method so I expect that this will eventually become the standard way to boot a USB device. However, many motherboards will support BOTH methods, and many older motherboards have USBZIP support.

Some newer BIOSs which support USB 2.0 will not boot from an older pen drive. Using a USB 2.0 compliant one usually solves this problem. Also, some older BIOSs which only support USB 1.1 will not boot from newer drives which support USB 2.0!

Some USB keys don't boot. If this is the case, it may be possible to fix them by installing a new master boot record. (Most keys boot OK by default; some cannot be fixed even by doing this. However, it helps in some cases). Run the command:

''WARNING! May break your primary hard drive if it's named sda'' 

lilo -M /dev/sda

==USB Booting in Neo1973's kernel==

Although there is very little information about it, the g_storage kernel module is responsible for the Neo's mass storage mode. The boot-or-not criteria might rely on this very module.

==TODO==

Testing/further research has to be conducted to determine:
* if a bootable-flagged partition / grub doesn't mess openmoko up
* if the phone can still act as a phone, or if the booted os can use the gprs functions
* if the phone can recharge on mass storage mode (from the usb cable)
* if a dedicated partition for each payload is needed (see memtest example...)
* if multi-boot is possible: grub?

==Linux distro Howto's: liveUSB creation==

In short:
#Mount USB drive, with e.g. mount /dev/sda1 /flash - can be either FAT16 or FAT32!
#Mount ISO image, with e.g. mount /tmp/dsl-3.2.iso /tmp/iso -o loop
#Copy all contents from ISO to USB drive: cp -vr /tmp/iso/* /flash/
#Rename and move syslinux files to root directory: mv /flash/boot/isolinux/* /flash/
#Rename isolinux.cfg: mv /flash/isolinux.cfg /flash/syslinux.cfg
#Unmount USB drive: umount /flash
#Install syslinux: syslinux /dev/sda1 and eventually set the MBR boot flag for this partition (with fdisk).

'''Transflash partitioning schema example'''

* 2 Gb: /dev/sd? (where N is the transflash's number)
* 700 Mb: /dev/sd?1 : containing bootable iso, FAT16
* 1300 Mb: /dev/sd?2 : openmoko & bootable os home partition, EXT3?
* + eventually a swap

The limitation of this method is that the booted OS is static (not-self modifiable). There's the option to install linux using the partition, but it's not really mobility-oriented (liveCDs are optimized for maximum autoconfiguration).

==Alternative methods==

===Booting ISOs ?===

* Grub? From [http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/grub_intro#comment-12900 How to install grub on an usb pendrive]:
    If you want to boot from a iso file on a harddisk, do something in menu.lst like
    title Boot from iso on a harddisk
    map (hdX,Y)/your.iso (hdZ)
    map --rehook
    chainloader (hdZ)+1
    rootnoverify (hdZ)
    boot

Grub & memdisk can boot floppy images, but (AFAIK) not isos. Example from the stock /boot/grub/menu.lst ubuntu:
    title           Ubuntu, memtest86+
    root            (hd0,2)
    kernel          /memtest86+.bin
    quiet
    boot

''Using the memdisk kernel from the syslinux package, you can load disk images and execute them in a non-emulated environment.''

* [http://www.knoppix.net/wiki/Cheat_Codes knoppix '''bootfrom''' cheatcode]

    bootfrom=/dev/hda1/KNX.iso 

Bootfrom needs access to a running Knoppix-System '''with the same Kernel as the Bootkernel''', before it is able to mount the partition / ISO-Image.  

* Maybe there's a way to achieve a boot cd iso selecter see ([http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?t=528840 this post])
* virtualization-oriented distro... ex [http://unit.aist.go.jp/itri/knoppix/xen/index-en.html Xenoppix] Cons: would work best only on modern VT-capable computers. What about a very minimal distribution (say DSL without X) kqemu-enblaed, booting into an ncurses iso-loader? The delicate part would be on the networking side.

===Using Qemu to boot Linux from a flash drive within Windows===

The following tutorial explains how to use Qemu to boot Linux from a portable USB flash device while still working within Windows. This Enables the user to have both systems running at the same time eliminating the need to restart the PC and set your BIOS options to boot Linux.

[http://www.pendrivelinux.com/2007/03/09/use-qemu-to-boot-linux-from-windows/ PendriveLinux article]

===Putting a vnc server on openmoko===

That's another alternative :)

===The BlackDog project===

"When plugged into the host computerâ€™s USB port, BlackDog starts up, '''automatically launching the X Window system for Windows Xming and a software NAT router via an autorun application that the BlackDog presents to the host through a virtual USB CD-ROM. Once those applications are running, the virtual USB CD-ROM drive disconnects, and a virtual USB-to-Ethernet adapter is connected to provide the communications link.'''

The host machineâ€™s monitor, keyboard, mouse, and Internet connection are used by the BlackDog for the duration of the session."

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackDog BlackDog server] project has lots of interesting concepts (and software). Could [http://www.jasonkolb.com/weblog/2006/11/idea_7_personal.html personal servers] change the face of computing ? Together with biometry, ''they open up the possibility of carrying your personal server, or an extension of it, with you on your physical person. The reason this is so exciting is because it enables biometric authentication that doesn't require shipping your biometric data to a third party'.
