An openmoko device could act as '''the perfect geeky swiss knive''': go anywhere with your Linux desktop and tools

When in storage device mode, a host computer should be able to boot on it, presenting a grub menu offering to boot into several images / partitions (payloads) on the transflash: memtest, UBCD (the ultimate boot cd), a lightweight security oriented livecd distro, you name it... 

Usually, all you need for this with an USB storage device (flash USB stick or external drive) is a partition, flagged "bootable" (see fdisk), containing a boot loader (say grub). But the problem is that specifications vary between motherboards, so there are variants and mandatory requirements to define (here would be a good idea), so that one can optimize/maximize the compatibility.

Similar functionality can be found in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizpy the Wizpy portable media player]

==Transflash partitioning schema example==

* 2 Gb: /dev/sd? (where N is the transflash's number)
* 700 Mb: /dev/sd?1 : containing bootable iso, FAT16
* 1300 Mb: /dev/sd?2 : openmoko & bootable os home partition, EXT3?
* eventually a swap

That way, one can install a new iso when it's released. An updater script shall be written.

==Linux distro Howto==

Summary: When the neo/openmoko device is connected in mass storage mode to a linux host,
# Partition the transflash into livecd (bootable flag) & home partition
# Format the created partitions
# Extract the iso's contents onto the livecd partition
# Rename isolinux.cfg and edit it syslinux.cfg (see ubuntu tutorial link)
# Make the partition bootable using syslinux:
    $ sudo syslinux -f /dev/sd?

==Memtest86+==

Grub example (from stock /boot/grub/menu.lst ubuntu install):

    title           Ubuntu, memtest86+
    root            (hd0,2)
    kernel          /memtest86+.bin
    quiet
    boot
