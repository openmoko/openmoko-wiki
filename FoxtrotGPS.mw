__TOC__

FoxtrotGPS is a map application which can show your current location. It also has features like showing points of interests and waypoints, but at its base it's not an actual navigation application which would tell you routes.

== Installing and Running FoxtrotGPS ==

Install package ''foxtrotgps''.

Run it from the menu or from command line. You may want to start ''gpsd'' GPS daemon, if it's not automatically started for you by the distribution, and likewise turn on the GPS chip on the FreeRunner (for example ''om gps power 1'' with the om tool from omhacks package).
