== Getting the Neo FreeRunner ==

The FreeRunner can be purchased from a [[distributors|distributor]]. The software available on the phone makes it suitable for power users and developers only -- it is not yet ready for the general consumer. Email announcements are found on the [http://lists.openmoko.org/mailman/listinfo/announce announce mailing list]. For frequently asked questions please check [[FAQ]].

== Intended use and users ==

The Neo FreeRunner is a Linux-based touch screen smart phone ultimately aimed at general consumer use as well as Linux desktop users and software developers.

Linux users and software developers will appreciate the total freedom they have to use and design software for the FreeRunner.

General phone users will eventually appreciate the high spec and performance of the phone and the wide range of free software packages expected to emerge. These will allow users to make the maximum use of the hardware and tailor it to their particular needs. Since launch, the pace of software tweaks and improvements has increased as both the Openmoko team developers and the wider community work together.

== How usable is it? ==

With most distributions the FreeRunner is working as a reliable phone. However it still has usability issues and many advanced features are still missing. (For example with SHR, the most used distribution, the phone keeps ringing for a second after a call has been accepted) For more information see [[Distributions#Features by distribution/release_target|distributions]].
