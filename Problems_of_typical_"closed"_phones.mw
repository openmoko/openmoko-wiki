 |Handset will only operate with SIM registered to a particular operator
 |Can be “unlocked” but takes some effort or a small fee to someone providing this service.

 |A user cannot develop an application for the phone even if he has the time and skills, or the applications the user can develop are limited in features available to them, speed and visual appearance (e.g. J2ME)
 |That is, no platform SDK is released to public
 |-
 |Many || Many || Many || Many
 |Installable applications that are not “blessed” (signed) by the handset manufacturer are limited in features available to them or trigger annoying security warnings even though you totally trust them

 |O2 || Orbit || Windows Mobile 6 || O2
 |Handset includes GPS but I bought the cheaper tarrif and this does not come with gps software. GPS capability has been locked by the operator and i cannot use it even with free applications like Google Maps for mobile which can use cell tower interpolation or GPS to provide location info
 |O2 orbit = HTC Touch (i think)

 |Operators do not allow an Internet Messaging application to be installed that could use GPRS (for those with cheap data plans) or WiFi to communicate with others. This is presumably because they are scared of losing SMS revenue.
