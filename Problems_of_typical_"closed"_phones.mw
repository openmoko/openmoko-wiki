 |Handset will only operate with SIM registered to a particular operator
 |Can be “unlocked” but takes some effort or a small fee to someone providing this service.
 |-
 |Many || Many || Many || Many
 |A user cannot develop an application for the phone even if he has the time and skills, or the applications the user can develop are limited in features available to them, speed and visual appearance (e.g. J2ME)
 |That is, no platform SDK is released to public
 |-
 |Many || Many || Many || Many
 |Installable applications that are not “blessed” (signed) by the handset manufacturer are limited in features available to them or trigger annoying security warnings even though you totally trust them

 |New models of the handset may have the same hardware but improved software. However, existing users cannot upgrade their firmware.

 |Nokia || N80 || Symbian || Operator independant problem
 |Manufacturer sold its model claiming VoIP, but the software wasn't present on the phone to actually use it for, say SIP calls. The following release of the phone (N80ie) included the feature in the software, while the hardware was identical to the former release (N80).
 | Customers had to wait for the N80ie software version to be available, and then use borderline methods to upgrade the software of their N80 to the N80ie version, to eventually be able to use a feature allegedly present in the N80. This operation put the phone warranty at risk.

 |Synchronization, update or other features involving the use of a desktop computer require a certain operating system on the computer, usually MS Windows
 |

 |Music and video can only be added to the media player “library” using certain “blessed” methods, such as downloading them from a preferred online store, or using a certain desktop media library software (e.g. iTunes)

 |An arbitrary audio file cannot be installed as a ringtone. Some operators even charge a fee to install the music you already bought as a ringtone
 |
 |-
 |O2 || Orbit || Windows Mobile 6 || O2
 |Handset includes GPS but I bought the cheaper tarif and this does not come with gps software. GPS capability has been locked by the operator and i cannot use it even with free applications like Google Maps for mobile which can use cell tower interpolation or GPS to provide location info
 |O2 orbit = HTC Touch (i think)

 |Operators do not allow an Internet Messaging application to be installed that could use GPRS (for those with cheap data plans) or WiFi to communicate with others. This is presumably because they are scared of losing SMS revenue.
 |
 |-
 |Many || Many || Many || Many
 |Operators do not allow VoIP applications to be installed because it's a competition to their primary business
