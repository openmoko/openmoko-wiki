 |Handset will only operate with SIM registered to a particular operator
 |Can be "unlocked" but takes some effort or a small fee to someone providing this service
 |-
 |O2 / Orbit / Windows Mobile 6 / O2
 |Handset includes GPS but I bought the cheaper tarrif and this does not come with gps software.   GPS capability has been locked by the operator and i cannot use it even with free applications like Google Maps for mobile which can use cell tower interpolation or GPS to provide location info
 | O2 orbit = HTC Touch (i think)

 |Operators do not allow an Internet Messaging application to be installed that could use GPRS (for those with cheap data plans) or Wifi to communicate with others.    This is presumably because they are scared of losing SMS revenue.

 |VOIP software to allow phone calls over the IP network is not allowed onto "closed" phones by most operators.   
 |Cheap phone calls to other VOIP enabled people are denied to you at locations where you have WiFi available
