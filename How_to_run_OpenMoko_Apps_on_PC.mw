===Install dependencies===

* use aptitude, apt-get, urpmi, or whatever your distro supports
* you will probably need
** gtk-dev
** pango-dev
** atk-dev
** qmake from Qt4 (libqt4-dev on Debian) -- this is optional and required only if you do not use auto-tools method

* Under ubuntu for using auto-tools: apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev libecal1.2-dev automake1.10 libxosd-dev

===Build the binaries===
====Build using GNU auto-tools====

=====Build libgsmd=====

  cd <svn-checkout>/src/target/gsm
  ./autogen.sh
  make
  sudo make install

This will build and install libgsmd required by the next step.

=====Set up the environment=====

  export OPENMOKODIR=<svn-checkout>/src/target/OM-2007
  cd $OPENMOKODIR/openmoko-libs
  ./autogen.sh
  make
  sudo make install

This will install the libraries in /usr/local/lib. If you prefer a non-system location, edit autogen.sh (and remember that an SVN update may undo that) to  add a "--prefix=MYDIR" option for where you want to put the compiled stuff. You can the run "make install" without sudo. One approach is to put stuff at the source root, by appending the option: "--prefix=$OPENMOKODIR".

=====Compiling sample apps=====

  cd $OPENMOKODIR/examples/<sample app>
  ./autogen.sh
  make
  sudo make install

If you used --prefix in the previous step to place the libraries elsewhere, make sure you edit autogen.sh to reflect that. I guess the proper way to do this is to set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH variable. You can of course drop the sudo then.

  ...
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$OPENMOKODIR/lib/pkgconfig
  ./configure ...


====Build using QMake (the mickeyl way)====
{{Note|qmake is Mickey's preferred build tool, it probably doesn't work if you're not him. Please use autotools...}}

=====Build everything in one run using Qmake=====

  cd <svn-checkout>/src/target/OM-2007
  . ./makevars.sh
  qmake
  make

Now the applications should be found in ./bin.

===Run the examples===

====Set your theme to OpenMoko====

Set the GTK2_RC_FILES variable before running OpenMoko applications:

  export GTK2_RC_FILES=$OPENMOKODIR/artwork/themes/openmoko-standard/gtk-2.0/gtkrc

Or edit $HOME/.gtkrc-2.0 to something like this:

  include "<PATH-to-svn-checkout>/src/target/OM-2007/artwork/themes/openmoko-standard/gtk-2.0/gtkrc"

However, this will make all Gtk2 apps run with the OpenMoko theme.

==== Naked execution ====

  bin/openmoko-stylus-demo
  bin/openmoko-finger-demo
  bin/openmoko-chordmaster

==== Execution within Xoo ====

Adjust svn://src/target/OM-2007/devel/scripts/launch-xoo to your needs (you may need to build some dependencies forehand)
Then set DISPLAY=:1 and run the examples

Also, see [[Getting Openmoko working on host with Xoo]].
