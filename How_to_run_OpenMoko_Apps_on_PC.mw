===Install dependencies===

* use aptitude, apt-get, urpmi, or whatever your distro supports
* you will probably need
** gtk-dev
** pango-dev
** atk-dev
** qmake from Qt4

===Build everything in one run using Qmake===
{{Note|qmake is Mickey's preferred build tool, you can use autotools as well...}}

  cd <svn-checkout>/src/target/OM-2007
  . ./makevars.sh
  qmake
  make

Now the applications should be found in ./bin.

===Set your theme to OpenMoko===

Edit $HOME/.gtkrc-2.0 to something like that:

  include "<PATH-to-svn-checkout>/src/target/OM-2007/artwork/themes/openmoko-standard/gtk-2.0/gtkrc"

===Run the examples===

  bin/openmoko-paned-demo
  bin/openmoko-finger-demo
  bin/openmoko-chordmaster
