===Install dependencies===

* use aptitude, apt-get, urpmi, or whatever your distro supports
* you will probably need
** gtk-dev
** pango-dev
** atk-dev
** qmake from Qt4

===Build everything in one run using Qmake===
{{Note|qmake is Mickey's preferred build tool, you can use autotools as well...}}

  cd <svn-checkout>/OM-2007
  . ./makevars.sh
  qmake
  make

Now the applications should be found in ./bin.
