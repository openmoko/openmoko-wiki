== Auto aligned map ==

Map that is automatically aligned to the north.

With an accelerometer it will be possible to make a compass. When the Neo1973 is used
for navigation it is useful if it always shows the map so the north of the map
always points to the north. When rotating the Neo1973 the map will rotate the other way
to keep north pointing north.

If the Neo1973 is held with the face down the map will be mirrored.

----

Unfortunately, this is only possible with a gyroscope, or a compass, you cannot tell direction with an accelerometer.
Consider the phone held vertical.
It sees an acceleration vertically down along the length of the phone.
If the phone is spun along the vertical axes, then the acceleration does not change at all, so you can't tell direction.
