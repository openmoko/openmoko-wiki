*"''I just wanted a phone that I could hack on and (as corny as this sounds) to share these hacks with my peers and gain their respect.''" '''Gervais Mulongoy'''

*"''I have a desktop PC, a laptop, two WLAN routers and a handheld (GP2X). Each device runs a variant of the GNU/Linux operating system. The free software on them makes them much more valuable and useful: One of the WLAN routers serves as a node in a public city-wide wireless network providing my internet access as well everyone who uses it as a relay node. Without free software such uses would not be '''possible'''. A mobile phone that from the ground up is build with free software is an excellent opportunity to explore new uses and features in this area. Apart from that I expect standard software (dialing etc.) to be of much higher quality and customizability.''
*''Finally I appreciate that LaForge (aka Harald Welte) is involved in the project. :-)''" '''Robert Schuster'''

*"''I want a hackable open source phone. It's OpenMoko rather then Neo1973 i want. I want to be able to hack in places I can't now. The project list is already way too big... Some light wight general plug-in system (D-Bus for activation/control and probably a subset of xembed). Your email (or any) viewer should be able to view anything You have a viewer for! Get Linux Vserver going, for lightweight sandboxing and carry dedicated 'machines' (for development, media station etc) in usb memory sticks (The need for self-powered usb sticks that charges when inserted in powered usb slots is huge). Want one yesterday!''" '''Lars Hallberg'''

*"''This is my way to support the open source community even if i don't need a new device although i own an A780 :-)''" '''Thomas Siegl'''
