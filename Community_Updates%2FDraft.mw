{{ApplicationBox|
Name=Literki 0.0.2-r3|
Description=This is a new version of your favourite keyboard. The mechanism for showing/hiding the keyboard has changed, now you show/hide Literki by sliding bottom right corner with your finger. You can configure what distance you need to slide. If you just click the bottom right corner, the click goes through to the application, so it (almost) doesn't affect using other applications when the keyboard is hidden. This update is concentrated on using libfreetype for fonts. Screenshot is available [http://pvtrace.com/literki2.png here]. Literki configuration file explanation is [http://pvtrace.com/literki_conf.html here]. OpenMoko users will need [http://shr.bearstech.com/shr-unstable/ipk/armv4t/libfakekey0_0.2+svnr1455-r1_armv4t.ipk libfakekey] as a dependency. Main changes are:
* it supports Unicode input. Tested only with Polish diacritic signs.
* it looks much nicer
* the keys are much more visible when transparent, thus transparency is on by default
* you can change the font and size |
