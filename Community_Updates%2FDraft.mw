OpenMoko distibution users will need separate '''[http://n2.nabble.com/file/n3284396/intone_0.60_arm.ipk-OM version]''' of intone and might need following dependencies:

* hopefully better top bar in playlist vie
* change priority from gui
* change playing song icon to play in list
* fixes to better support logical order when changing from random->normal and vice versa
* support bluetooth streaming to A2DP sets from intone (__you'll have to pair the headset yourself__)
* better time display on progress bar
* even better scan routine (please rescan your songs for the right names to be picked up)
* some code speedups
* fixed ui break in album art view with long song names|

* '''[http://lists.openmoko.org/nabble.html#nabble-f1958 The University of São Paulo's intent to join Openmoko development.]'''

* Ben Wilson wrote a '''[http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Unbricking_the_Neo1973_(GTA01)_without_a_debugboard wiki]''' page for the un-bricking GTA01 using a simple LPT -> JTAG  circuit. It may also work for doing some actual debugging and should be pretty easy to wire up to gta02 as well.

* David Lanzendörfer has managed to boot OpenMoko on the HTC-Dream with framebuffer console. That means: Android linux kernel + OpenMoko (Angstrom) user space. If someone is interested in participating the development, youre welcome to help.
