= FOSDEM 2011 =

Date: Saturday 5 and Sunday 6 February 2011

Unfortunately the request for a dedicated Devroom was declined.
So let's collect interesting talks and attendents. I.e. create sort of a "Visitors Guide".

The official FOSDEM agenda is here: http://www.fosdem.org/2011/

For reference, here is the page from last year: [[Fosdem_2010]]

Openmoko can share booth space at the http://hackable-devices.org/ booth, which sports open projects like Makerbot, Milkymist, Watts'nzCity, or Shruthi-1. You can find the tables in the H building. Contact wim or john @hackable-devices.org for more.
