Prototype page - unfinished, ignore.

http://www.openstreetmap.org/ is an map, contributed to by users.

All that is required is a GPS with the ability to log tracks. These tracks are later annotated using either personal knowledge, or notes taken at the time, to form roads or canals, or other features. (They cannot be copied from commercial maps, as this is a breach of copyright and or terms and conditions).

The neo1973 GPS is quite adequate for this.

There are several possible use-cases.
