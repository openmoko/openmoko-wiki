=== Configuring Om 2008.8 ===

==== Internet ====

===== Connecting your FR through USB to an internet-connected computer =====

Follow this [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306126 guide (Windows Users)]to share your internet with your phone.

To share your internet connection on a Linux host follow this [[USB_Networking|USB networking guide]].

*If you are also behind a router you may have to change your LAN IP range in your router to avoid using 192.168.0.* as this is the same IP range as what your phone and ICS uses. (If you don't there will be an IP conflict) (see below for a workaround)

After you install and run [[http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Om2008.8#Download Om 2008.8 ]] for the first time you have to restart to get the USB working. Once you have done that you have to ssh into your phone (192.168.0.202) to edit your /etc/network/interfaces so you can access the internet through USB to install software and updates.

Edit the USB section to look like this:

# Ethernet/RNDIS gadget (g_ether)
# ... or on host side, usbnet and random hwaddr
auto usb0
iface usb0 inet static
address 192.168.0.202
netmask 255.255.255.0
network 192.168.0.0
gateway 192.168.0.1

{{Editing|Emsyr|10/12/08|I believe that the gateway address above should be 192.168.0.200. At least that is how it worked for me (after connecting my NEO to PC following [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/USB_Networking USB networking guide]). Please confirm if this edit is globally correct or not and then delete it.}}
up echo nameserver 208.67.222.222 > /etc/resolv.conf
up echo nameserver 208.67.220.220 >> /etc/resolv.conf
#up echo nameserver 192.168.0.200 > /etc/resolv.conf

If you have a 192.168.0.* network, with .200 to .203 ip not used, you can do the following on FR:

auto usb0
iface usb0 inet static
address 192.168.0.202
netmask 255.255.255.252
network 192.168.0.200
gateway 192.168.0.201

and set your host ip to 201. Don't forget to modify routing and check [[USB_Networking|USB networking guide]] for a DNS MASQ using 192.168.0.201 as FR DNS.

===== Wireless =====

See [[Neo FreeRunner Wifi]] for details on how to use Wifi to connect your FR to the internet.

==== Advanced power management ====
If you decide not to install the Unofficial Zecke updates you should install "illume-config" to can gain access to more advanced power management features and to change the look of the GUI through the wrench that will now appear in the top bar. (Restart your phone)

==== Mediaplayer ====

There are 2 media players available for the 2008.8 device.

===== opkg install qtopia-phone-x11-mediaplayer =====
Seems to be a very nice application, place media in " ~/Documents/ " or " /media/card/ "

Install it using the "install" application or by typing:
 opkg install qtopia-phone-x11-mediaplayer


===== Openmoko-mediaplayer2 =====
Sice this media player currently is based on the pulseaudio sound server --- and this sound server breaks all phone applications using sound as soon as the phone goes into power saving mode it is unwise to install this application at this time.

If you have already installed this application you have to uninstall pulseaudio, as well, to get your phone working as a phone again.

This Media Player is basically useless due to the default theme, to. To install with a better theme run:

opkg install openmoko-mediaplayer2
wget http://abraxa.dyndns.org:81/random/openmoko-mediaplayer-theme.tar.bz2
tar xjf openmoko-mediaplayer-theme.tar.bz2 -C /usr/share/themes/Moko/gtk-2.0
rm openmoko-mediaplayer-theme.tar.bz2

=== Bugs/Fixes ===

{{todo|Link to bugreports and check if some of them might be fixed in newer updates}}

*The Media Player is basically unusable because of the skin. And is also very buggy.
*Battery meter always says its charging. Installing a terminal and running "apm" will display the proper battery status.  (Appears to now work with the latest updates -- [[User:Tkep|Tkep]]

*Your phone will go into standby after 30 seconds EVEN when connected to your computer or wall charger. (Disable this under the settings menu)

*The wifi doesn't work too well right now. (well, works now with 2008.8 updates, I think -- [[User:OlivierBerger|OlivierBerger]] 14:25, 31 August 2008 (UTC))

*Accelerometers have alpha support via [[Gestures]]

*If you only want the rotate screen effect you can give a [[rotate|try to this one]] 

*If you let the battery completely drain you will have problems booting it up. Plug it into the wall charger for a few hours and then plug it into your computer and press power.
*BUT, '''if you have another charged battery''', such as from the [http://us.direct.openmoko.com/products/spares-pack Spares pack], you can boot the Neo with the good battery, plug in wall-charger, and hot-swap the drained battery while booted. This allows you to immediately start "fast-charging" with the wall-charger. (Neo needs to be booted to recognize charger and switch to fast-charging)

*You'll have to install "illume-config" to have more control over power management, scrolling speeds, keyboard options, and to change how the interface looks.

*Some software that you install by command-line may appear in in the settings menu (wrench) that you unlock after installing "illume-config".
