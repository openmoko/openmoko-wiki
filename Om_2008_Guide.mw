=== Configuring Om 2008.8 ===

==== Internet ====
Follow this [[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306126 guide (Windows Users)]]to share your internet with your phone.

To share your internet connection on a Linux host follow this [[USB_Networking|Guide]]

*If you are also behind a router you may have to change your LAN IP range in your router to avoid using 192.168.0.* as this is the same IP range as what your phone and ICS uses. (If you don't there will be an IP conflict)

After you install and run [[http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Om2008.8#Download Om 2008.8 ]] for the first time you have to restart to get the USB working. Once you have done that you have to ssh into your phone (192.168.0.202) to edit your /etc/network/interfaces so you can access the internet through USB to install software and updates. 

Edit the USB section to look like this:

 # Ethernet/RNDIS gadget (g_ether)
 # ... or on host side, usbnet and random hwaddr
 auto usb0
 iface usb0 inet static
 	address 192.168.0.202
 	netmask 255.255.255.0
 	network 192.168.0.0
 	gateway 192.168.0.1
 	up echo nameserver 208.67.222.222 > /etc/resolv.conf 
 	up echo nameserver 208.67.220.220 >> /etc/resolv.conf 
 	#up echo nameserver 192.168.0.200 > /etc/resolv.conf

==== Unofficial (zecke) Updates ====

Now edit the Multiverse repository (/etc/opkg/Multiverse-feed.conf) to fix a typo: Remove the duplicate "/" before Multiverse. 

Create a file named zecke.conf and paste this into it to get the latest unofficial updates. (Temporary Repository)

 src/gz zecke-all http://people.openmoko.org/~zecke/om2008.8-dev/all
 src/gz zecke-arm http://people.openmoko.org/~zecke/om2008.8-dev/armv4t
 src/gz zecke-neo http://people.openmoko.org/~zecke/om2008.8-dev/neo1973
 src/gz zecke-gta02 http://people.openmoko.org/~zecke/om2008.8-dev/om-gta02

(Restart your phone)

==== Advanced power management ====
If you decide not to install the Unofficial Zecke updates you should install "illume-config" to can gain access to more advanced power management features and to change the look of the GUI through the wrench that will now appear in the top bar. (Restart your phone)

==== Mediaplayer ====

The Media Player is basically useless due to the default theme. To install with a better theme run:

 opkg install openmoko-mediaplayer2
 wget http://abraxa.dyndns.org:81/random/openmoko-mediaplayer-theme.tar.bz2
 tar xjf openmoko-mediaplayer-theme.tar.bz2 -C /usr/share/themes/Moko/gtk-2.0
 rm openmoko-mediaplayer-theme.tar.bz2


=== Bugs/Fixes ===

*The Media Player is basically unusable because of the skin. And is also very buggy.
*Battery meter always says its charging. Installing a terminal and running "apm" will display the proper battery status.

*Your phone will go into standby after 30 seconds EVEN when connected to your computer or wall charger. (Disable this under the settings menu)

*The wifi doesn't work too well right now.

*Accelerometers have alpha support via [[Gestures]]

*If you only want the rotate screen effect you can give a [[rotate|try to this one]] 

*If you let the battery completely drain you will have problems booting it up. Plug it into the wall charger for a few hours and then plug it into your computer and press power.
*BUT, '''if you have another charged battery''', such as from the [http://us.direct.openmoko.com/products/spares-pack Spares pack], you can boot the Neo with the good battery, plug in wall-charger, and hot-swap the drained battery while booted. This allows you to immediately start "fast-charging" with the wall-charger. (Neo needs to be booted to recognize charger and switch to fast-charging)

*Your have to install "illume-config" to have more control over power management, scrolling speeds, keyboard options, and to change how the interface looks.

*Some software that you install by command-line may appear in in the settings menu (wrench) that you unlock after installing "illume-config".
