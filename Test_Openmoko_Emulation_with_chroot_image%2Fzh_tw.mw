{{Languages|Test Openmoko Emulation with chroot image}}
There is an image to provide a fresh Ubuntu 7.04 (feisty) containing the Openmoko installation as generated by [[MokoMakefile]] including working [[Openmoko under QEMU|QEMU]].


== Usage of the chroot image ==

{{note|This Image is outdated (OM 2007.1)}}


If you do just want to test some of the functionality and need a starting point,
you can download an ext3 Image.

The Image is just a first test and may contain errors as it's not tested well yet
(and the build process was not running through without user interferences).


=== Installation ===

Get the Image (about 3.2 GB) from http://b030.tfh-berlin.de/Openmoko-Dev-x86_2007-07-16.img.bz2:
wget http://b030.tfh-berlin.de/Openmoko-Dev-x86_2007-07-16.img.bz2


Check the md5sum:
md5sum Openmoko-Dev-x86_2007-07-16.img.bz2
# it print "41715e06d7e59a94e4f05cf33ba054b5  Openmoko-Dev-x86_2007-07-16.img.bz2"


You will need to decompress the Image (about 15 Gbyte). An you'll also need the chroot software
and loop back device support in your kernel.

bzip2 -d Openmoko-Dev-x86_2007-07-16.img.bz2

To install chroot in GNU/Debian / Ubuntu you can use:

sudo sh
apt-get install dchroot


==== To mount and activate the chroot image use ====

mkdir /var/chroot
mount -o loop Openmoko-Dev-x86_2007-07-16.img /var/chroot

Add a new chroot configuration:

echo "Openmoko /var/chroot" | tee -a /etc/dchroot.conf

Edit /etc/fstab and insert:
/tmp            /var/chroot/tmp         none    bind            0       0
proc-chroot     /var/chroot/proc        proc    defaults        0       0
devpts-chroot   /var/chroot/dev/pts     devpts  defaults        0       0

Tell mount to re-scan fstab and mount the new directories automatically:
mount -a

(optional) Manual mount:  If you do not want the system to mount these directories at boot, they can instead be mounted by hand.  Note that this will need to be repeated each time the system is rebooted:
mount -o bind /tmp /var/chroot/tmp
mount -t proc proc-chroot /var/chroot/proc
mount -t devpts devpts-chroot /var/chroot/dev/pts

Copy your /etc/resolv.conf:
cp /etc/resolv.conf /var/chroot/etc/

As the user who started X11:
xhost +                   # assuming you are behind NAT

Start the chroot environment (as root again):
dchroot -d -c Openmoko    # -d to take the environment variables with you

=== Starting the Emulation ===

You can start the emulation by running:
cd /home/moko/openmoko/trunk/src/host/qemu-neo1973/
export DISPLAY=:0.0
arm-softmmu/qemu-system-arm -M neo -m 130 -mtdblock openmoko/openmoko-flash.image \
-kernel openmoko/openmoko-kernel.bin -usb -show-cursor -usbdevice keyboard

=== Additional Notes ===

There is no root password set and no user moko in the systems right now which should
not be a problem when used in an emulator or a chroot environment, here you have both.
