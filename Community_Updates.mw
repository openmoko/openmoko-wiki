'''Community Updates'''

Latest status reports to the community, usually updated at least twice a month, usually from Michael Shiloh ([[User:MichaelShiloh]]). Updates are also mailed to the community mailing list (see below for previous updates), and major updates are also sent to the announce list.

You are invited to add questions or topics you think should be included in the Community Updates.

==Current Status==

===GTA02 hardware production and qualification===
GTA02v3 is quite solid, but a flaw in power distribution required another revision. A very small number of GTA02v4 have been manufactured. Evaluation by internal OpenMoko engineers should start any day now.
===gllin GPS driver for GTA01===
We have received permission to distribute this driver in binary-only form, however  
the binary format is different from what we now use. There are various work-arounds (chroot, wrapper) but they raise legal questions. We are in the process of sorting out these legal issues.
===The apparent lack of 850 MHz GSM support in USA+Canada (e.g. comment 24 on bug #256)===
I think it's a combination hardware and software issue.
===Delivery of a GSM firmware update for the 3G SIM bug (#666)===
I believe the problem has been solved and we have permission to update the firmware, but there is a question as to how to legally update in the field.
===The current Neo1973 is not FCC approved to operate in the 850Mhz band===
It would be illegal for FIC to sell the device in the US with it activated. BT and PCS is the only approved band currently.
