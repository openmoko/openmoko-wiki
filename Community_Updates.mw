== Rules for community updates ==
After May 22dnd 2009 OM stopped working on community updates. These rules are here to make it possible for the community to keep the updates running.

The draft of the news will be in the Talk page of the next Community Update page (example, see http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Talk:Community_Updates/June_25%2C_2009 ). The news will be added there. On release, the content of that page is moved to be the content of the actual page ( http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Community_Updates/June_25%2C_2009 ). Detailed instructions below.

'''Adding news'''
# Don't expect someone else to add it, add it yourself and make it nice
# Add links to blog posts, applications, mailing list posts that you think are worth to announce to the whole community

'''Releasing'''
# If it's The Release Date and you notice the news has not been released, DO IT! Don't expect someone else to do it for you.
# When you release, move the content of Talk: page to the actual wikipage.
# Add a link to the released update page to http://wiki.openmoko.org/index.php?title=Community_Updates
# Prepare the draft page for the next community news: captions, dates etc.. Releasing news on Thursdays every two weeks sound's good to me.
# Send a post to the community mailing list with the link to the released news and the draft of the next news.

Even though Openmoko strives to keep the community informed of the development progress, Openmoko does not provide delivery dates. Instead, Openmoko Inc. reports and discusses the project on a day to day basis, using the [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/ openmoko-community mailing list]. Developers will wish to follow the progress on the [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/openmoko-kernel/ openmoko-kernel mailing list] and the [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/devel/ devel mailing list]. Major updates notices are sent to the [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/announce/ announce mailing list].

As FreeRunners started shipping, that series of Community Updates mostly related to the expected release date has been taken over by a more community-oriented newsletter.
