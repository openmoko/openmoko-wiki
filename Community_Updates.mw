Even though FIC strives to keep the community informed of the development progress, FIC does not provide delivery dates. Instead, FIC tries to report on the project status here and on the openmoko-community mailing list. 

The status is usually updated at least twice a month, usually by [[User:Michaelshiloh|Michael Shiloh]]. Updates are also mailed to the community mailing list (see below for previous updates), and major updates are also sent to the announce list.

You are invited to add questions or topics you think should be included in the Community Updates.

The latest Community Update is the [[November 27, 2007 Community Update]].

===GTA02 hardware design and test===
The information below has been collected from various sources, feel free to add questions and comments here.

While writing a device driver for the new battery which provides an accurate counter of the charge state of the GTA02, the driver developer discovered that the device driver does not get a reading of the charge state due to a very long response time with only one I/O signal when trying to read the charge state. To be able to read the battery status properly, it has been written that it will be necessary to re-design that part of the GTA02 for hardware version GTA02A5 to use two I/O signals to reduce the response time (one for transmitting commands, one for receiving data?). [http://bugzilla.openmoko.org/cgi-bin/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=957#c1 Bug 957] may have more information.

Comment: GTA02a5 is a minor variation from GTA02a4, so it shouldn't take very long. We are waiting for confirmation of Wifi hardware on GTA02a4 before we manufacture even a small test run of GTA02a5.

===gllin GPS driver for GTA01===
11/29/2007 - Thanks to a tremendous amount of hard work by many people, we have ready
a release of gllin, the GPS drives. Instructions at [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2007-November/011916.html] or grab the ipk directly from [http://3rdparty.downloads.openmoko.org/gllin/].

===850 MHz band not supported in USA+Canada (e.g. comment 24 on bug #256)===

The GSM chip set is capable of quad band operation but the circuit implemented only supports 3 bands. So, 850Mhz is not supported on the GTA01 board. Instead we support 900/1800/1900MHz.

Anyone interested in more details is welcome to email me.

===Delivery of a GSM firmware update for the 3G SIM bug ([http://bugzilla.openmoko.org/cgi-bin/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=666 #666])===
Background:

A bug in the GSM firmware prevents some USA 3G SIM cards from working properly. The bug has been fixed, but since the GSM module is under extremely tight legal protection, it is not clear whether or how we can allow customers to perform this upgrade themselves.

November 13, 2007:

We have heard that TI has figured out a way to let you, our customers, upgrade the firmware, but we have not been able to get hold of the person at TI who can tell us how we should do this.

We have permission to perform a Very Hacky Workaround: Get your Neo to me (Michael Shiloh), and I will perform the GSM firmware upgrade for you. Contact me for details.

==Questions or Topics you think are missing==

=== SMedia 3362 Documentation & OpenGL ES Drivers ===
There is an open source kdrive driver being written for the GTA02 which will use hardware to accelerate the XRender extension. While the chip is capable of 3D graphics, no OpenGL ES driver/library is avaliable and OpenMoko developers will not be writing one in the near future (although they have not ruled it out in the long-term). 

Documentation for the SMedia 3362 has been promised ([http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2007-September/010175.html see this post]). However, this refers to documentation OpenMoko developers will be writing themselves, not the technical documentation SMedia have provided OpenMoko with. The OpenMoko developers had to sign an NDA with SMedia to obtain this documentation and are therefore unable to pass this information on to community developers. (See [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2007-November/011349.html this post] for details)



=== Binary driver for GPS? ===
Last time I read, the GPS module would be identified as a serial port device that could be dealt with by existing GPS Free Software without needing binary drivers, what's this setback on user's freedoms due to? I was so hoping for a computer who could make calls and give me directions which was 100% Free Software. Is this only temporary or definitive?
