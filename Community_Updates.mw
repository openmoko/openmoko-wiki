'''Community Updates'''

As we strive to make our development progress as open as possible, we do not provide delivery dates. Instead, we continuously report on the project status here and on our mailing list. 

The status is usually updated at least twice a month, usually by [[User:Michaelshiloh|Michael Shiloh]]. Updates are also mailed to the community mailing list (see below for previous updates), and major updates are also sent to the announce list.

You are invited to add questions or topics you think should be included in the Community Updates.

==Current Status==

===GTA02 hardware production and qualification===
GTA02v3 is quite solid, but a flaw in power distribution required another revision. A very small number of GTA02v4 have been manufactured. Evaluation by internal OpenMoko engineers should start any day now (relative to October 31, 2007).

===gllin GPS driver for GTA01===
We have received permission to distribute this driver in binary-only form, however the binary format is different from what we now use (OABI vs EABI in 2007.2 vs 2007.1 OpenMoko). There are various work-arounds (chroot, wrapper) but they raise legal questions. We are in the process of sorting out these legal issues.

===850 MHz band not supported in USA+Canada (e.g. comment 24 on bug #256)===

The GSM chip set is capable of quad band operation but the circuit implemented only supports 3 bands. So, 850Mhz is not supported on the GTA01 board. Instead we support 900/1800/1900MHz.

Anyone interested in more details is welcome to email me.

===Delivery of a GSM firmware update for the 3G SIM bug (#666)===
I believe the problem has been solved and we have permission to update the firmware, but there is a question as to how to legally update in the field.


==Questions or Topics you think are missing==

=== SMedia 3362 Documentation & OpenGL ES Drivers ===
There is an open source kdrive driver being written for the GTA02 which will use hardware to accelerate the XRender extension. While the chip is capable of 3D graphics, no OpenGL ES driver/library is avaliable and OpenMoko developers will not be writing one in the near future (although they have not ruled it out in the long-term). 

Documentation for the SMedia 3362 has been promised ([http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2007-September/010175.html see this post]). However, this refers to documentation OpenMoko developers will be writing themselves, not the technical documentation SMedia have provided OpenMoko with. The OpenMoko developers had to sign an NDA with SMedia to obtain this documentation and are therefore unable to pass this information on to community developers. (See [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2007-November/011349.html this post] for details)
