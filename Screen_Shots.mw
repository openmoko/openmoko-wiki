'''Note on Screen orientation''':

'''xrandr -o 1''' turns screen to landscape mode (xrandr -o 0 to go back to ordinary portrait):
<pre>xrandr -o 0 # default </pre> 
<pre>xrandr -o 1 # landscape - from right side </pre> 
<pre>xrandr -o 2 # upside down </pre> 
<pre>xrandr -o 3 # landscape - from left side </pre> 


==Locally from the device==

You can grab screen shots manually by using the following command on your Neo:

 # cat /dev/fb0 >myscreenshot_001.raw

You can then convert this on your pc with fb2png by using the following command:

 # fb2png myscreenshot_001.raw myscreenshot_001.png 9 480 640 16


You can also push a screen capture back onto the display:

 # cat myscreenshot_001.raw >/dev/fb0


If you want to show a sequence of screens in an animation you can use convert. Once you have all your screen shots as .pngs try:

 # convert -delay 25 -dispose Background +page myscreenshot_*.png -loop 0 animated_test.gif

==From a Remote Connected Desktop==
