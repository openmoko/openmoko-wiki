=== Connectors ===

==== Debug cable to phone ====
Use the flat ribbon-cable to connect to the phone.  
# The wide end is for the Debug board, the narrow end for the phone
# For both sides:
## Lift the brown lever of the connector on the PCB
## Place the copper contacts on the bottom (brown surface facing to the top.
## Insert the ribbon cable as far as possible into the connector (it won't go in all the way, that's normal)
## Close the brown lever to lock the ribbon cable

== Questions ==

* Can it also be connected to [[GTA01v4]] ?
