== Usage instructions ==

=== Connectors ===

==== Debug cable to phone ====
Use the flat ribbon-cable to connect to the phone.  
# The wide end is for the Debug board, the narrow end for the phone
# For both sides:
## Lift the brown lever of the connector on the PCB
## Place the copper contacts on the bottom (brown surface facing to the top.
## Insert the ribbon cable as far as possible into the connector (it won't go in all the way, that's normal)
## Close the brown lever to lock the ribbon cable

==== Serial Console ====

* The serial console is available via one of the two DB9-sockets, It has a DTE (terminal) configuration.
* The socket is called "P4", which is written in small white letters next to it on the PCB.  If you're looking at the three female DB-Ports (from the plug side), it is the left port.
* You can use any standard USB-Serial converter and plug it directly onto the DB9-socket. There's no level-shifting required.

==== JTAG ====

* The 20pin JTAG header is a standard ARM JTAG.
* Pin 1 can be found next to the corner of the PCB (small white circular mark printed on PCB).
* Make sure to have the red wire of the ribbon cable go to Pin 1

==== Power Suppply ====

* If the phone is self-powered, there is no need to connect a power supply for JTAG, USB and serial port, since those are phone-powered
* If you need Ethernet, you will have to either supply power via the USB device jack, or via a +5V power supply.

=== Reset button ===

S5 (small white button in corner of PCB) is a reset button.  If you press it, it resets the device.

== Questions ==

* Can it also be connected to [[GTA01v4]] ?
