== Answerphone/Recording Application ==

Able to record voice-notes (wav or speex-encoded), save them to configurable folder.



= Answerphone: =
calls can be supressed/forwarded to answerphone via button while incoming call or global configuration. 

Incoming call: caller can only hear voice-message recorded by yourself, sound from mic supressed (a case for alsa-states). after that he can leave a message which is recorded like your voice-notes, but shown elsewhere. 

Launcher: You are informed that you've missed a call and/or there's a message left. In the answerphone-menu: you can see a list of messages with number/name of caller, view them, listen to them, answer them by call or sms, delete messages.

Maybe implementable as extension to "Call-Log".
