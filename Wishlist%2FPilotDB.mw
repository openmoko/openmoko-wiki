== Pilot-DB port/clone ==

One very useful application that I have installed on my palm pilot is [http://pilot-db.sourceforge.net/ Pilot-DB].  I have several databases/spreadsheets that I keep on my palm pilot for quick reference.  

I have started implementing this for OpenMoko.  I'm looking for alpha testers: if you have used [http://pilot-db.sourceforge.net/ Pilot-DB] or any similar application, have databases in a format supported by [http://sourceforge.net/projects/palm-db-tools/ palm-db-tools] (i.e. pilot-DB 0.3.x, pilot-DB 0.2.x, MobileDB, List or JFile 3) and have a Linux desktop computer, please contact me at bryan at larset dot st.
