== bike mount for the Freerunner ==
I am using a bike mount [http://www.pearl.de/a-PX2065-4044.shtml sold by PEARL] as [http://andre.web-yard.de/blog/2008/08/03/neo-freerunner-rocks-hard-rides-free/ described by Andr√© Gaul].

It is cheap, made of plastic only (even the parts to attach it to the bike, just the spring for opening is metal).

This bike mount is not buffered, I had it jump out of the lower part once on a very bumpy road. You could attach the lower part to the upper part with a cord as a backup solution. Luckily in my situation my Freerunner (and upper mount part) was still held by the USB cable.
You will have to attach it very strong in order to avoid that the whole thing is moving around on bumpy roads!

I should also mention that the part which is actually holding your Freerunner is kind of soft (foamy?), but will keep it's shape made by the FR after some time. The spring to open the side holding parts is also working worse after a week or so.

Overall you get what you pay for and it is quite usable.

It is even waterproof if you put a transparent plastic bag with a zipper on top (which is available in stores here for deep-freezing food).
