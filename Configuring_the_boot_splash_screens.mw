There are three boot screens (also called splashes or splash screens) as of 13 Nov. 2007.  The U-Boot splash is displayed until the kernel takes over.  Presumably the kernel will eventually display a splash while it boots.  When userspace initializes, psplash displays a splash.  Finally X displays a splash when it starts.

=== U-boot Splash ===

Werner's README states the following:
: "The splash image is a raw dump of the 480x640x16 frame buffer, with RGB
: 5:6:5 organization and HWSWP = 1. To save a lot of space and to greatly
: improve speed, we gzip the raw dump."


So what you have to do to create your U-boot splashscreen is
# create your splash-file with the dimensions 480x640 (in 16bit preferrably) and save it in png format
# get the necessary tools for converting it
#* get the conversion script
#** download the Perl script kindly provided by [http://svn.openmoko.org/developers/werner/splash/ Werner Almesberger]
#** make it executable with ''`chmod u+x splashimage.pl`''
#* Optionally: have a look at the README file. It should contain the most up-to-date info from Werner himself.
#* Make sure to have netpbm installed.
#** Check your ${PATH} for ''pngtopnm'' and ''pbmtorgb3'' executables.
#** If those programs are missing, check whether rle-support is enabled for netpbm.
#* If you don't have Dfu-util already, get [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Dfu-util#Binaries it here].
# convert the png-file
#* execute ''`./splashimg.pl yourfancynewsplashscreen.png | gzip -9 > bootscreen.splash`''
#** '''Make sure you redirect the output!''' The perl-script shoves the splash-data to stdout.
#** ''-pnm'' makes the pngtopnm-executable dispensable and eats a generic pnm-/pbm-file - gimp can export to them, for example.
#** If you omit the png-file, ''splashimg.pl'' will be looking for a file named ''System_boot.png''
#** ''-32'' will create a 480x640x32 frame buffer
#: ( I have '''no''' idea if that's supported (???) )
#** ''-swap'' causes some XOR operation performed in the end of the image creation.
#: ( Some kind of inverting? Option for different edianness? )
# upload your new bootscreen.splash ( you need alt-name: splash )
#* if you don't know how to do that: check the instructions found [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Dfu-util#Command-line_options here]
# '''IMPORTANT!''' check the exact size of your splash-file (e.g. ''ls -l'' or ''du -b'')
#:: Explanation: The flash-partition reserved for the splash image (dubbed ''splash'') is 655360 Bytes (0xa0000) in size; per default u-boot only reads 20480 (0x5000) of those, though.
#:
#* Essentially, this leaves you with 3 choices:
#** Make a splash image that's gzip'd smaller than 20480 Bytes. This is somewhat boring, as it imposes limits to your creativity.
#** Turn off the read-limit, so u-boot scans the whole splash-partition before commencing boot. This would mean a little longer time till the image is actually displayed. And I mean: little.
#** Or tailor the read size to the size of your splash.
#*** If it's smaller than the pre-defined 0x5000 Bytes, u-boot is done with reading sooner.
#*** If it's bigger than the 0x5000 Bytes, you will ''have'' to adapt it or your image won't be displayed correctly.
#:
#: So, if you do (need) to edit the size:
# Start your u-boot. And make sure you're in NAND (as opposed to NOR).
#:: (You do that by pressing ''PWR'' briefly before pressing ''AUX'' - keep them both pressed until the u-boot appears.)
#* Now select USB-Console, plugin your USB-cable and start the tty-console of your choice
#:: e.g. ''`screen /dev/ttyACM0`''
#:
#* for the GTA01:
#*: ''setenv splashimage nand read.e 0x32000000 splash 0x5000\; unzip 0x32000000 0x33d00000 0x96000''
#*: ''saveenv''
#* for the GTA02:
#*: ''setenv splashimage nand read.e 0x32000000 splash 0x5000\; unzip 0x32000000 0x8800000 0x96000''
#*: ''saveenv''
#:
#: In those commands, replace the 0x5000 with the size of your choice - or omit it altogether. The minimum size you have to put is the size of your splash-file - or you will receive garbage.
#: Also consider that this is a basic terminal; input is not ''exactly'' like on the shells you're used to.

This ticket has recent explanations: <strike>[http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1735 1735]</strike>.

== Linux kernel ==
''To Do''

== psplash ==
You need to recompile psplash, because the picture is hardcoded.  There is a script in the source for psplash for making a new header file.  On Ubuntu, you need the libgtk2.0-dev package to run the script.

make-image-header.sh my_image.png HAND
mv my_image-img.h psplash-hand-img.h

Then add your custom header to the OpenEmbedded recipe (org.openembedded.dev/packages/psplash/files/openmoko/psplash-hand-img.h), or rebuild psplash by hand.

== X splash ==

The X server accepts a -root-ppm option, which takes a plain old (raw) ppm file.  Replace /usr/share/pixmaps/xsplash-vga.ppm on the phone or org.openembedded.dev/packages/xserver-kdrive-common/xserver-kdrive-common/openmoko/xsplash-vga.ppm in OpenEmbedded.

With more gory details, ''/etc/X11/Xserver'' ends with the lines:
<pre>
# start off server in conventional location.                               
                                                               
ARGS="$ARGS -dpi 285 -screen 480x640 -hide-cursor -root-ppm
/usr/share/pixmaps/jsplash-vga.ppm vt1"                                    
   
#ARGS="$ARGS -dpi 285 -screen 480x640 -hide-cursor vt1"                    
                                                               
DISPLAY=':0'                                                               
                                                               
exec xinit /etc/X11/Xsession -- $XSERVER $DISPLAY $ARGS $* >/tmp/x.log 2>&1
</pre>

The '-root-ppm' is the static splash screen.  

Following that, Xsession starts enlightenment, passing it $E_PROFILE as
defined in ''/etc/enlightenment/default_profile''.

== E splash ==

''/usr/share/enlightenment/data/init'' contains one or more .edj files
that each define an animated splash init that appears next, and until
enlightenment finishes loading.  The .edj file used is determined by
$E_PROFILE.  So if default_profile contains E_PROFILE='-profile illume'
then enlightenment will try to start up with ''illume_init.edj'' for the splash
(the 'cylon' animated blip, or various other animations depending on image)
and will try to use ''/usr/share/enlightenment/data/themes/illume.edj'' as the
theme for illume.  If it's E_PROFILE='-profile fso' then it looks for
''fso_init.edj'' splash and ''fso.edj'' theme, etc.
