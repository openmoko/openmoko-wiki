To be able to test the latest paroli directly on the phone, the simplest method to 
mount the local paroli source via nfs. Maybe sshfs works too. Need somebody to 
document sshfs way.

* http://www.linuxconfig.org/HowTo_configure_NFS

== Setting up nfs on the local computer (laptop) ==
 sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server


The /etc/exports file:
 /home/[username]/[path to paroli] 192.168.0.202(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,anonuid=0,anongid=0)


Restart the nfs server:
 /etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server restart


== Making connection with the phone ==

* usb networking:
 sudo ip address add 192.168.0.200/24 dev usb0


* ssh in:
 ssh root@192.168.0.202


== Mounting local dir from the phone ==
 mount -t nfs 192.168.0.200:/home/[username]/[path to paroli] /usr/share/nfs-paroli 


== Compiling the theme ==
 cd /usr/share/nfs-paroli/paroli-applications; ./build.sh


== Running paroli ==
 cd /usr/share/nfs-paroli/paroli-scripts; ./paroli-launcher.sh

== Setting up Paroli without a FreeRunner ==

NOT READY YET

=== E17 ===

Enlightenment 17 (E17) used by Paroli is a big bunch of code which is not readily packaged to most distributions (largely because no release is declared stable so it's a moving target). One script to help installing E17 is available at [http://omicron.homeip.net/projects/ omicron], Easy_e17.sh.

Easy_e17 checks out and installs most of E17 automatically, under /opt/e17. If you dislike running random scripts from the web, check the script first before running. You can rerun it with "-u" to update or "-i" to try installing again if for example some dependencies were missing during the first run. If some compilation fails, check out the error message and install needed dependencies. It may get a few iterations of "-i" before you get to the finish without errors, so prepare to spend some time.

Easy_e17 does not seem to install Python bindings E17, but it does download them. By default you can find them in your home directory under ~/e17_src/BINDINGS/python. Those are required for Paroli.

(to be continued)

=== Paroli ===

Check out [http://www.paroli-project.org/running-paroli/ Paroli source code] from the git repository as usual. Set up your environment to use the E17 installed with something like follows:
<pre>
export PATH=${PATH}:/opt/e17/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/opt/e17/lib
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${PKG_CONFIG_PATH}:/opt/e17/lib/pkgconfig
</pre>
Run ''build.sh'' under paroli-applications and then ''paroli'' under paroli-scripts. If you get a complaint about "No module named elementary", you are (still) missing the E17 Python bindings.

== Frequently asked question about nfs ==

=== Can I map the phone's UID(root) with my local UID (notebookuser=1000)? ===

Sadly '''NO'''. There were a map_static option, but it was removed in nfs-kernel-server.
Here is a '''5''' year old bugreport about this issue:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=130261

=== Does anongid and anonuid impact the security? ===

Certainly. It permits to anybody (on your local network) to be able create
files with the remote uid. Root(uid=0) in our freerunner case.

=== Shouldn't I add chmod go+w recursively to that mounted dir, to be able creating files? ===

Yepp, this is the alternative to using anongid/anonuid in /etc/exports.

=== Is there an alternative to nfs? ===
  Yepp, sshfs would be the easiest. Need somebody to figure out the steps, and 
  update this doc.
