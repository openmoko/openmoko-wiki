To be able to test the latest paroli directly on the phone, the simplest method to 
mount the local paroli source via nfs. Maybe sshfs works too. Need somebody to 
document sshfs way.

# Setting up nfs on the local computer (laptop)
{{{
sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server
}}}

The /etc/exports file:
{{{
/home/[username]/[path to paroli] 192.168.0.202(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,anonuid=0,anongid=0)
}}}

Restart the nfs server:
{{{
/etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server restart
}}}

# Making connection with the phone

usb networking:
{{{
sudo ip address add 192.168.0.200/24 dev usb0
}}}

ssh in:
{{{
ssh root@192.168.0.202
}}}


# Mounting local dir from the phone
{{{
mount -t nfs 192.168.0.200:/home/[username]/[path to paroli] /usr/share/nfs-paroli 
}}}

# Compiling the theme
{{{
cd /usr/share/nfs-paroli/paroli-applications; ./build.sh
}}}

# Running paroli
{{{
cd /usr/share/nfs-paroli/paroli-scripts; ./paroli-launcher.sh
}}}

# Frequently asked question about nfs

* Can I map the phone's UID(root) with my local UID (notebookuser=1000)

Sadly '''NO'''. There were a map_static option, but it was removed in nfs-kernel-server.
Here is a '''5''' year old bugreport about this issue:
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=130261

* Does anongid and anonuid impact the security.

Certainly. It permits to anybody (on your local network) to be able create
files with the remote uid. Root(uid=0) in our freerunner case.

* Shouldn't I add chmod go+w recursively to that mounted dir, to be able creating files?

Yepp, this is the alternative to using anongid/anonuid in /etc/exports.

* Is there an alternative to nfs?
Yepp, sshfs would be the easiest. Need somebody to figure out the steps, and 
update this doc.
