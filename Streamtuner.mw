'''streamtuner''' is a streaming media directory browser. Through the use of a C/Python plugin system, it offers a GTK+ 2.0 interface to Internet radio directories. streamtuner does not actually play any files, it downloads list of online radio streams then tells the unix player (users option) to play the selected stream. streamtuner offers hundreds of thousands of music resources in a more common interface.

streamtuner is free software, released under the terms of the revised BSD license.
