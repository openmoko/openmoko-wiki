'''NB:''' Current (2008-04-04+) builds of Openmoko now come with the syntax compatible '''[[Opkg]]''' tool, not [[ipkg]].

The practical way to install software on Openmoko is with the Opkg, possibly via the graphical Application Manager. Naturally, you need to have obtained an Openmoko system by other means initially.

In the shell, "opkg update" will update the list of available packages, "opkg upgrade" will download and install all packages that have a newer version available and "opkg install new-app" will download and install "new-app".

Have a look at [[Users Repositories]] to get addresses of alternative software repositories, e.g. ScaredyCat's ipkg repository.
