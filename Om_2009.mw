'''Om2009''' is the next version of the official Openmoko distribution. It is currently under development and should be released in May 2009 to replace [[Om2008]]. It will be based on the [[OpenmokoFramework|freesmartphone.org]] middleware.

==Development==

Currently Om2009 is in alpha state. The progress of the development is documented regularly in the Status updates at [[OpenmokoFramework]]. For the release plan see [http://n2.nabble.com/Om2009-release-plan-tp2410042p2410042.html].

As Om2009 is still incomplete and unstable, it is not suited for daily use yet. If you want a rather functional distribution you can install the [[Stable Hybrid Release]], which is a similar distribution developped by the community.
