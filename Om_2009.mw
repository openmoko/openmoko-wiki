The image will boot fullscreen into [[Paroli]] and all of the features below will be available<br>

====Neo 1973====

The images are under [http://downloads.openmoko.org/distro/testing/Neo1973 testing]. There are some rootfs tarballs for installing onto an SD card. The images and tarballs  have a couple of issues. <br>

1) the battery driver is still not working correctly.

2) The g_ether driver is not getting loaded at boot so an entry needs to be added to the /etc/modules file.


The image will boot fullscreen into [[Paroli]] and all of the features below will be available<br>

== Development ==

Currently Om 2009 is starting its beta phase. Testing builds will be generated into the [http://downloads.openmoko.org/distro/testing/ testing] disto.<br>

The progress of FSO development is documented regularly in the Status updates at [[OpenmokoFramework]]. For the Om 2009 release plan see [http://n2.nabble.com/Om2009-release-plan-tp2410042p2410042.html]. 

This page will be updated to reflect the status of Om 2009<br>

== Features Status ==

Below is the feature list for Om 2009. It's broken down into features that have been implemented and need testing, and features that still need to be finished

=== Implemented ===

phone calls incoming and outgoing<br>
sms incoming and outgoing<br>
simple phone book (no images)<br>
call log<br>

=== Bug List and Known Issues ===

gsm0710muxd: "Modem does not respond to AT commands" [http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/2257 OM 2257]

illume: exit dialog is only 1 pixel wide

after using the keyboard in [[Paroli]] it doesn't go away until the window gets closed

== Tweaks ==

Add a bind-home directory to the first partition ( must be ext2 or ext3 ) of your SD card. When the system boots it will mount the bind-home directory as /home/root. This allow you to reflash the phone without losing anything in your home directory ( [[Paroli]] contacts and settings, maps, etc )

== Debugging and Bug Reporting ==

=== Persistent logs ===

To have persistent logs, ones that remain after a reboot, the /var/log symlink needs to be turned into a directory

<pre>
rm /var/log
mkdir /var/log
</pre>

Your log files should now be full of information and remain there after a reboot.

=== Reporting Bugs ===

Please enable debugging as above. Attaching frameworkd.log and paroli.log will aid in solving the bug. 

Please search the bug list for you issue before adding it to trac. Some of these issues might be [[Paroli]] or FSO issue so you can also check their tracs for solutions or discussions.
