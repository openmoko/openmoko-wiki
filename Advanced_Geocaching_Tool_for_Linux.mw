This page shows the current position, the current altitude, the distance to the selected target, your current bearing and the position of the target.
'''1''' shows the direction to the target. Please be aware that this can only be correct if you move and if you're more than about 10 meters away from the target. So keep movin' :-)
'''2''' use this button to manually enter coordinates.

This shows the current map and the geocaches nearby. Of course, you must download the geocaches beforehand. To do this, use button '''4'''. ''This only downloads the position of geocaches in the selected map view.'' If you want more details for a geocache, go to details tab or use the download tab. If there are more than 500 geocaches in the selected map rectangle, nothing will be downloaded. Zoom in or selected a different rectangle.
'''1''' is a geocache which has been selected by clicking on it. On the right hand side of the screen you can see one of it's waypoints (requires that details have been downloaded).
'''2''' the geocaches are color coded as follows: green for traditional geocaches, orange for multi stage geocaches, gray for geocaches you already found and blue for everything else (includes unknown, virtual, event and webcam geocaches)
'''3''' use this button to always have the map centered on your current position. You can still move the map, as long as your gps position doesn't change.

[[Image:doc-search.png]]
This tab allows you to search through the internal database. All search settings you defined here will be valid for the map view too, as soon as you click "Find". 
'''1''' search for name or ID
'''2''' double click an entry to see it on the map
'''3''' you can sort the columns by clicking on the according header. Some properties will only be available after downloading the details for a geocache.
'''4''' if you want to see each and every geocache in the list or on the map, click here.
