==Installation==
You can find the package at {{opkg.org|268|opkg.org}}. 

==Prerequisites==
AGTL was tested and developed on the latest SHR builds. If you experience performance problems, please consider testing latest SHR unstable/testing builds.

==Known Bugs==
* Colors are wrong on non-default themes
* Output directory for caches is not created autmatically yet
* '''You have to restart the application after you entered your account data'''
* a double click on a geocache on the search tab doesn't show any reaction. It sets the target correctly, though.

==Known Limitations==
* Map display is not as fast as tangoGPS's. This is partly due to a not fully optimized code, but also a limitation of python's speed (compared to C).
* You can only use openstreetmap tiles. Opencyclemap etc. are not implemented yet.
* Maps folder is not configurable

==Usage==
First, go to the "opt." tab and enter your geocaching.com login data. Restart the application (see above).

This page shows the current position, the current altitude, the distance to the selected target, your current bearing and the position of the target.
# shows the direction to the target. Please be aware that this can only be correct if you move and if you're more than about 10 meters away from the target. So keep movin' :-)
# use this button to manually enter coordinates.

This shows the current map and the geocaches nearby. Of course, you must download the geocaches beforehand. To do this, use button '''4'''. ''This only downloads the position of geocaches in the selected map view.'' If you want more details for a geocache, go to details tab or use the download tab. If there are more than 500 geocaches in the selected map rectangle, nothing will be downloaded. Zoom in or selected a different rectangle.
# is a geocache which has been selected by clicking on it. On the right hand side of the screen you can see one of it's waypoints (requires that details have been downloaded).
# the geocaches are color coded as follows: green for traditional geocaches, orange for multi stage geocaches, gray for geocaches you already found and blue for everything else (includes unknown, virtual, event and webcam geocaches)
# use this button to always have the map centered on your current position. You can still move the map, as long as your gps position doesn't change.

# search for name or ID
# double click an entry to see it on the map
# you can sort the columns by clicking on the according header. Some properties will only be available after downloading the details for a geocache.
# if you want to see each and every geocache in the list or on the map, click here.
