This is the Software specification for the Openmoko Neo FreeRunner Button and LEDs.
''Note that this is a future specification which is not yet implemented in the software''

=Taxonomy=

==Buttons==
* AUX = Button on the left side of the device, upper area
* POWER = Button on the right side of the device, center area (right below the USB socket)

==Leds==

==Modes==
* OFF = Device has no power or has been shutdown
* ON = Device is fully powered
* ON+CHARGING = Device is fully powered and has been connected to a USB host or Openmoko charger.
* LOCK = Device is fully powered, but has screen lock displayed
* SUSPEND = Device has been suspended to low-power mode

=Basic Button Usage=

This is grouped by mode:

==Mode: OFF==

* To switch the device on: Press and hold POWER until the boot logo appears.
* To enter the "normal" (NAND) boot menu: Press and hold POWER, one second later press and hold AUX.
* To enter the "rescue" (NOR) boot menu: Press and hold AUX, then press and hold POWER.

==Mode: ON==

* To suspend the device: Press POWER.
* To shut down the device: Press and hold POWER for 4 seconds. If the device hangs, press and hold POWER for 8 seconds. If it still hangs, remove the battery.
* To go to the home screen: Press AUX.
* To display the profile screen: Press and hold AUX until it appears.

==Mode: SUSPEND==

* To wakeup the device: Press POWER.

=Basic LED Usage=

This is grouped by mode:

==Mode: OFF==

* All LEDs will be turned off.

==Mode: ON==

* HEARTBEAT will emit a short blink every 4 seconds.
* If Bluetooth is powered on, WIRELESS will emit a short blink every 2 seconds.
* If Wifi is powered on, WIRELESS will emit a long blink every 2 seconds.
* If Bluetooth and Wifi are powered on, WIRELESS will be lit continuosly.

==Mode: ON+CHARGING==

''Same as ON, with the exception of''
* HEARTBEAT will increase blinking as the charge level of the battery increases.
* HEARTBEAT will be continuosly lit, if the battery has been fully charged.

==Mode: SUSPEND==

* All LEDs will be turned off.

=Advanced Button/LED Usage=

* In ON-Mode, EVENT will blink every 2 seconds if there's an event that needs your attention.
* The more events, the faster EVENT will blink.
* Pressing AUX will acknowledge the event with the topmost priority and display it to you.
* EVENT will stop to blink once all events have been acknowledged.

=Minimal LED Usage=

Some people prefer to have no LED signalling because of reduction of power usage and/or light pollution or simply because of aesthetic reasons. This can be split in ''normal button minimal LED usage'' and ''advanced button minimal LED usage''.

==Mode: OFF or SUSPEND==

* All LEDs will be turned off.

==Mode: ON or LOCK==

* HEARTBEAT will emit a short blink every 4 seconds only when battery power is low. Optionally the number of blinks can be increased or the number of seconds can be decreased as the battery power is getting more critical. More information on the battery status can of course be found on the display itself.
* EVENT will blink every 4 seconds if there's an event that needs your attention.
* If either Bluetooth or WiFi is powered on but is not actively used, WIRELESS will emit a short blink every 4 seconds. This is a notification that power is being consumed by Bluetooth or WiFi without being put to use. When Bluetooth or WiFi is being actively used, WIRELESS will not blink or be lit at all. That status is know by the user implicitly because of information on the display or the active use involving the user. When none of them are powered on, the LED will also not be lit at all.
