This page is supposed to be a gathering point for all OpenMoko interested people in Norway.

 See [[Talk:OpenMoko_Local_Groups:_Norway|discussion]].

Currently there have been created local groups for the following cities/regions in Norway:
* [[OpenMoko_Local_Groups:_Oslo|Oslo]]
* [[OpenMoko_Local_Groups:_Trondheim|Trondheim]]

Please sign up on this national list below (especially) if you can't find a local group near you; this page can also be used to map the need/interest of creating more local groups. Some overlapping info may occur.
