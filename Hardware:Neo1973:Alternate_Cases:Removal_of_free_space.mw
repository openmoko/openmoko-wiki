There is unnecessary free space within the case - this variant would remove that, possibly with some re-arrangement of components, to make the phone slightly smaller.
:Wouldn't it be easier and more productive to fill this space with extra hardware? Check out hardware wishlist. People have plenty of reasonable suggestions that would fit into the free space. I would guess that making the phone smaller would be a lot more complicated then this solution. [[User:Yogiz|Yogiz]] 16:04, 4 June 2008 (UTC)
