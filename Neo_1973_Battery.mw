It is apparently compatible with the Nokia BL-5C See [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2007-February/003758.html this mailing list post] These are available very inexpensively from ebay. Though quality will of course vary.

BL-5C battery will work in Neo, but not the other way around. Battery is too thick for Nokia, and attempting to use Neo battery in nokia will result in Nokia entering strange "test mode".
