The battery is a one 3.7V (nominal) cell.
It has internal protection circuitry, and a capacity of 1200mAh.

On the battery, which has dimensions of approximately 53mm*38mm*7mm is
written "FIC, First International Computer, Model: GTC-01/GTA-01, Standard Battery Pack, 1200mAh Li-ion, Rechargeable Battery: 3.7V".

It is apparently compatible with the Sony BLC-5 See [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2007-February/003758.html this mailing list post] These are available very inexpensively from ebay. Though quality will of course vary.
