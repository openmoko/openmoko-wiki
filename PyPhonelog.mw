This daemon uses the framework to track and log all the calls made to and from the moko.
Because it uses the framework, it's limited to [[FSO]] supporting distributions only. The daemon uses sqlite and currently (Read: Has to change) keeps the database in "/home/root/.phonelog.db". It has a dbus interface which enables pulling out incoming/outgoing and missed calls including the time the call was placed at.

This daemon uses the "org.smartphone.opimd" dbus bus name. It's by no means the expected opimd, it's just a daemon that uses this name because it makes sense!

This package also includes a working gtk+ gui for use with the daemon.


If you want the gui to work with finger scrolling, download:
