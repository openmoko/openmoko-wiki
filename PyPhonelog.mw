This daemon uses the framework to track and log all the calls made to and from the moko.
Because it uses the framework, it's limited to [[FSO]] supporting distributions only. The daemon uses sqlite and currently (Read: Has to change) keeps the database in "/home/root/.phonelog.db". It has a dbus interface which enables pulling out incoming/outgoing and missed calls including the time the call was placed at.

This daemon uses the "org.smartphone.opimd" dbus bus name. It's by no means the expected opimd, it's just a daemon that uses this name because it makes sense!

This package also includes a working gtk+ gui for use with the daemon. The gui also keeps a file in "/home/root/.phonelog.dat".


If you want the gui to work with finger scrolling, download:

'''IMPORTANT NOTICE:''' For some reason in the newest shr the daemon hasn't started automaticlly at boot time. After a bit of debugging I noticed that's because the frameworkd isn't started yet while the daemon is trying to connect it (although it's set to start a long time after). I added a sleep for 4 seconds in 0.4.2 (and on?) though this must be resolved otherwise.

= Package =
* author: Tom Hacohen <available_at_profile>
* this is a python script so code resides in /usr/bin/phonelogd and /usr/bin/phonelog untill I open a proper place for it.
* link: [http://stosb.com/openmoko/fso-phonelog_0.6.2_armv4t.ipk package]

=Change Log=
'''0.6.2'''
* Cleaned the code a bit. Cleaned everything that got ugly in version 0.6.0 ;]
'''0.6.1'''
* Thanks to a patch by Thomas, the new missed calls are now bold and the old ones are regular.
'''0.6.0'''
* As suggested by Thomas, the new missed calls and the old missed calls are now marked in different colors.
'''0.5.0'''
* As suggested by Thomas, the missed calls page is now opened first by default.
'''0.4.2'''
* The issue described in 0.4.1's changelog has been hacked to work. (added a sleep for 4 seconds)
'''0.4.1'''
* It seems 0.4.0 started too fast after the framework daemon causing the daemon to fail connecting to the framework. In this version, startup is supposed to be delayed a bit.
'''0.4.0'''
* Daemon now starts upon installation
* Added a clear list button
* DB does not get erased after upgared anymore.
* The GUI app starts faster than before.
'''0.3.1'''
* Fixed the broken premissions that were found in the previous package.

= TODO =
* add integration with phonebook so it will get the name as well as the number
* add a limit to x records
* clear lists only updates the list after a restart of the app. make it an instant change
