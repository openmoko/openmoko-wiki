This daemon uses the framework to track and log all the calls made to and from the moko.
Because it's uses the framework, it's limited to [[FSO]] supporting distributions only. The daemon uses sqlite and currently (Read: Has to change) keeps the database in "/home/root/.phonelog.db". It has a dbus interface which enables pulling out incoming/outgoing and missed calls including the time the call was placed at.
There might (Read: will) be changes with the datatypes used by the dbus interface since the dbus return signature is now aas which isn't suitable for sending timestamps (current hack: converting the linux time to string and then back), and furthermore, using a dictionary is far more elegant.

This daemon uses the "org.smartphone.opimd" dbus bus name.

This package also includes a working gtk+ gui for use with the daemon.

= Package =
* author: Tom Hacohen <available_at_profile>
* this is a python script so code resides in /usr/bin/phonelogd and /usr/bin/phonelog untill I open a proper place for it.
* link: [http://stosb.com/openmoko/fso-phonelog_0.1_armv4t.ipk package]


== TODO ==
* add integration with phonebook so it will get the name as well as the number
* fix the dbus interface to work with dictionaries and fix the idiotic to string conversion.
* add a limit to x records and erase log options
* find out where to get the libmokoui2 python bindings from
* move to "/usr/share/..." (or even "/var/log"?)
