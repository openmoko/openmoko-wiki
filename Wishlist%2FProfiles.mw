A profile is a set of configurations that determine how the phone handle different events. Example of profiles include:

* Airplane profile (No radio activity)
* Night (Silent ring tone except for people on the emergency list).
* Meeting 
* In business hours (People marked as business contacts get preference)
* Out of business hours (People marked as business contacts are diverted to voice mail)
* Car profile/Motorcycle profile

=== Travel profile ===

If you travel alot people may not know what timezone you are in. The caller will be assigned a time zone based on the country code of caller id. This can be overridden in contacts. If the caller is not in the same time zone the phone could play a message about the current local time. This will give the caller the option of hanging up if he really did not want to call you at 4 am. The timezone can be computed automatically using [[Set Local Time]].

=== Profile timeout ===

When you enter a cinema you want the profile to go to cinema-profile. But there is a risk you forget to turn it back to normal. So in the cinema you enable the cinema profile with a timeout for 2 hours. If you do not actively disable it again it will automatically do so after 2 hours, and go back to the profile that is normally defined for this time/place.

=== Location based profile ===

Based on the location automatically switch profile. If you are at the location called 'Work' switch to the profile 'At work'. If you are at the location called 'Home' switch to the profile 'At home'.

One could implement something similar to the DVB-H specification time slicing idea, activating and deactivating the GPS unit to probe location, say, every 10 minutes, to determine the correct profile.

=== Identity ===

As discussed on P2PMobileSharing, your profile would also specify which Contact was you. So you may have a business card, personal card, or info at certain conventions/venues. This would then be the card that is shared via Bluetooth when you want to exchange vCard info with others on their mobiles/PDA's.

=== Override profile ===

If the current profile makes the phone ring silent or divert caller to voice mail, then caller can override this and have the phone ring anyways (e.g. by pressing #). Caller must be on callee's white list to do so.

=== Usage warning ===

(This is not really a profile - maybe an option for place new call/send new text message?).

Phone companies have different plans. These plans often contain some allotted minutes and text messages per month. The smartphone will need to know the price for calls. The smartphone can keep a record of calls and messages, and give a warning when the low priced minutes are up.

=== Kid mode ===

Like usage warning, but placing new calls/sending new text messages will be block except for some white listed numbers (numbers of the parents).

A password controlled application to run on the owners PC used to enable or disable the following features on the phone.
* Control the numbers that can be called
* Control the duration of calls that can be made
* Prevent phone from being used at certain times
* Alert the parent/guardian if the location of the phone (requires GPS device) is not at (or within a configurable range of) one of a list of permitted locations by a certain (configurable) time e.g. have to be home by 10pm.
* Alternatively constantly record GPS position, either once a minute or periodically at a set frequency.
* Mail or SMS GPS recorded locations to parents periodically at a set frequency.
* Record time and duration of phone calls
* Record all phone calls
* Disallow installation of software that is not 'child' rated.
* Restricts website content or which websites can be seen, or restrict methods of internet access, for example only via home or school network SSID (requires WiFi device)

===Employee modes===

A password controlled application to run on the owners PC used to enable or disable the following features on the phone.

* Control the numbers and or duration of calls that can be made
* Prevent phone from being used at certain times
* Regularly send via SMS the GPS (requires GPS device) location of the phone during working hours e.g. delivery driver route monitoring
* Record GPS track log whenever it is in range of a certain bluetooth device (the employees company vehicle)
* Record numbers called, time and duration of calls placed during working hours.
* Disallow installation of non-company-approved software.



=== Car profile/Motorcycle profile ===
In addition to normal profile settings, the phone would automatically enable bluetooth, and start searching a prespecified bluetooth handsfree unit.
 


==== User Profiles ====
This is different from contextual profiles for mobile phones, that might for example turn off the ringer, and turn on 'vibrate', when you select 'quiet'.
 
They are profiles to let the owner of the phone set it up in a comfortable manner, without configuring every aspect.

*'''[[Wish List UserProfile Beginner|Beginner]]''': Only basic functionality like, telephone and SMS
*'''[[Wish List UserProfile Advanced|Advanced]]''': All in the "Beginner" profile, with e-mail, PIM functions
*'''[[Wish List UserProfile Geek|Geek]]''': every functionality you can get
*'''[[Wish List UserProfile Elderly|Elderly]]''':  minimum, specialised  functionality
*'''[[Wish List UserProfile Child|Child]]''': Parents set limits for their child's phone.
*'''[[Wish List UserProfile Employee|Employee]]''': Employers set limits for their employees phones.
*'''[[Wish List UserProfile Subscriber|Subscriber]]''': Subsidised phone, with limits set for the user.

The first modes are easily switchable between by the user, as they are also the owner of the phone.
In the '''Child''', '''Employee''', '''Subscriber''' cases, this may not be the case.

For example, for an employees phone, it may:
*Record GPS track log whenever it is in range of a certain bluetooth device (the employees company vehicle)
*Record all calls during working hours.
*Disallow installation of non-company-approved software.

For a child's phone, it may:
*Constantly record GPS periodically.
*Mail GPS recordings to parents once an hour.
*Record details of all phone calls
*Disallow installation of software that is not 'child' rated.

For Elderly it may have really simple "help" call (customised, e.g. to family member or ambulance)

For these modes to be tamper proof, it would require on-phone security.
A version of u-boot that would only allow signed images and some application on owners PC to generate them, and set policy.

====Cell tower driven profiles====
Allow the use of Cell Id's rather than GPS coordinates to activate/deactivate/change profiles/things on the device. Cell Id changes could trigger scripts etc. (Store them in sqlite db?)

==== Tariff plan monitor ====
User should be able to define multiple profiles based on their tariff plan.
I guess this has to be slightly modified accordingly to the various country differences over the world; 
PC side apps for easily defining profiles is needed. 
PC side based apps should be able at least to output in standard database format, xml, html.

Ideally users would be able to monitor their use of their smartphone basing on various paramethers such kb exchanged on various acces (GPRS/EDGE/UMTS) and connection time, calls number, frequency, duration, contacts called, etc.
User should be able to set alarms based on limits and even password protected blocks if configured.
Alarms for cheaper time for using the smartphone payed services if time day based tariff plan occurs would be helpfull.
This data sould be stored securely or encrypted if possible as privacy care.



==== Internet Connection Management ====
An application that automatically chooses the best available connection method, between Bluetooth, USBnet, Wifi, GPRS, etc.  For GPRS or other services where the user may be paying per kb, there should be options to limit data transfer.  The user could be asked permission to transfer data: per connection, per process, per process for a specific time limit, per process for a specific data size limit, etc.
This manager should also handle the different internet connection settings for different sim cards.





==== Automated profile switching ====

With a [[Wishlist:Silent mode timeout|"silent mode" timeout]], there is no need to turn the ringer back on if you previously know how long will be the film/meeting/...

Profile zoning - define different zones for switching different profiles automatically either by GPS zoning, Wi-Fi proximity or GSM base station proximity.

Profile scheduling - more complex than timeout. Ability to create a schedule for activating different profiles, or integrate profile switching with the schedule.

The switching might be done by [[Wishlist:Point_of_Interest_Framework]].
