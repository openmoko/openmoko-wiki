Streamripper is a stand-alone client that records Internet radio streams in the MP3 or Vorbis formats. Streamripper is now part of the FreeBSD standard distribution, mentioned in the Linux MP3 HOWTO, and can be compiled on many platforms, including Linux, Windows, FreeBSD, BeOS and OS/2. Therefore creating a portability for OpenMoko would help to stream radio station on the SD card and listen to the music later offline with no internet connection.

There is no OpenMoko version at the moment.
