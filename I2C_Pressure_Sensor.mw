The BMP085 ([http://www.bosch-sensortec.com/content/language1/downloads/BMP085_DataSheet_Rev.1.0_01July2008.pdf Datasheet]) from [http://www.bosch-sensortec.com/content/language1/html/3477.htm bosch sensortec] is a simple, easy to use, pressure sensing device. It speaks I2C and includes a temperature sensor.
Because of it's tiny size of 5.0mm x 5.0mm x 1.2mm it fits nice into the Freerunner. I glued mine into the empty space next to the bluetooth antenna.

An experimental kernel driver for the chip is available from [http://gitorious.org/freerunner-navigation-board/bmp085 gitorious]
