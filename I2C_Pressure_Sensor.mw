The BMP085 ([http://www.bosch-sensortec.com/content/language1/downloads/BMP085_DataSheet_Rev.1.0_01July2008.pdf Datasheet]) from [http://www.bosch-sensortec.com/content/language1/html/3477.htm Bosch Sensortec] is a simple, easy to use, pressure sensing device. It speaks I2C and includes a temperature sensor.
Because of it's tiny size of 5.0mm x 5.0mm x 1.2mm it fits nice into the Freerunner.

The sensor needs just four wires: power (3.3V, GND) and I2C (SDA, SCL). The wiki page about [[I2C]] describes where to get them.

I glued mine next to the BT antenna.


An experimental kernel driver is available from [http://gitorious.org/freerunner-navigation-board/bmp085 gitorious].
It searchs for the chip at I2C address 0x77 and exports a sysfs interface where you can read the temperature and the pressure as well as adjust the internal oversampling.
