== About OpenOCD ==

[http://openocd.berlios.de/ OpenOCD] is a 100% free software On-chip-debugger for commonly-found ARM JTAG probes such as [[wiggler]], chamaeleon, jtag-key and others, like the [[Debug Board]].

It provides a human-readable telnet interface for manually halting/resuming the target device, reading/writing registers and memory, etc.

In addition, it provides a RDI (remote debugger interface) on a TCP port.  This interface can be used by gdb (the GNU Debugger).

The GTA01 development team used OpenOCD with a [[wiggler]] compatible probe as their ICE solution in the very beginning, until they had designed their own [[Debug Board]].

== Getting OpenOCD ==

=== MokoMakefile ===

The [[MokoMakefile]] "make openmoko-devel-tools" target will build statically-linked openocd and [[dfu-util]] binaries. The "bitbake openocd-native" command may also be used.

=== Debian Package ===

We now have a Debian binary package of OpenOCD, available from http://people.openmoko.org/laforge/dpkg. Installing this package is the preferred method to install OpenOCD on your development machine like

 dpkg --install openocd_82-1_i386.deb

[http://packages.debian.org/openocd Debian/Unstable] also contains an OpenOCD build.

=== Gentoo Ebuild ===
There is an experimental ebuild for openocd in the [http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=200689 gentoo bugzilla] - seems to be already in Gentoo now (May 2008) however you may need to edit the e-build because it has no keywords enabled by default: edit /usr/portage/dev-embedded/openocd/openocd-9999.ebuild and replace ''KEYWORDS=""'' with ''KEYWORDS="amd64 x86"''.  Remember to regenerate the digest afterwards:
 ebuild /usr/portage/dev-embedded/openocd/openocd-9999.ebuild digest
 # Build openocd
 emerge libftdi
 USE="ftdi ft2232" emerge openocd

=== Source Code ===

OpenOCD Revision 82 and later have been proven to work with our [[QT2410]] and [[Neo1973]] target board and wiggler as well as Amontect JTAGkey and JTAGkey tiny.  You can e.g. check rev. 130 out of the OpenOCD subversion via

 svn co -r 130 http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/openocd/trunk

=== Windows Binaries ===

The [http://www.yagarto.de/ YAGARTO] Project provides a Win32 installer for OpenOCD. Details and download can be found at http://www.yagarto.de/howto/openocd/index.html. This will then work with the FDTI drivers available from http://people.openmoko.org/laforge/misc/debug_board_v2/windows_drivers/

== Configuration ==

[[User:HaraldWelte]] has provided a [http://people.gta01.hmw-consulting.de/laforge/misc/openocd.cfg openocd.cfg configuration file] for use of OpenOCD with wiggler and the QT2410 target board. 

== Using OpenOCD ==

We cannot provide a full manual for OpenOCD, but please check 
[[Bootloader#Using_JTAG_to_boot_from_RAM]] and [[NAND bad blocks#JTAG_.2F_OpenOCD_.2F_u-boot_RAM_based]], as well as the [[Neo1973 OpenOCD#Using OpenOCD telnet interface]] section below.

== Known Bugs and Troubleshooting ==

=== CP15 register read/write of ARM920T core not working ===

This has been reported upstream. Bugfix pending.

=== Did you turn it on ? ===

An easily made but devastating mistake is to forget to actually activate the CPU. Just connecting power is not enough !
Press and hold the power button until the boot loader does its count-down, or, in case there is no runnable boot loader,
the CPU keeps itself busy.

=== number of discovered devices in JTAG chain doesn't match configuration ===

You get something like:
 Error:   jtag.c:1224 jtag_examine_chain(): number of discovered devices in JTAG chain (51) doesn't match configuration (1)

This seems like a libftdi initialization bug.  Sometimes the FT2232 doesn't get completely reset into a sane state at startup of OpenOCD.  Please unplug the USB cable from the [[Amontec JTAGkey]] / [[Debug Board]] and re-plug.  It should immediately work the next time.  Bugfix would be appreciated a lot!

=== JTAG communication failure ===

Another common error is this one:
 JTAG communication failure, check connection, JTAG interface, target power etc.

Also this one is fixed by unplugging and re-plugging USB.

== OpenOCD and [[Debug Board]] ==

=== libftdi-0.8 ===

If you want to use OpenOCD with our Debug Board v2, and want to use the serial port simultaneously with OpenOCD, you '''need libftdi-0.8 or later'''.  Chances are high that your distribution still ships an earlier version of libftdi, so you might want to download it from http://www.intra2net.com/de/produkte/opensource/ftdi/ and build yourself.

=== openocd.cfg ===

This is an openocd.cfg that is known to work with [[Debug Board]] (v2/v3), [[Neo1973 Hardware#GTA01Bv3]] and OpenOCD 130:
<pre>
telnet_port 4444
gdb_port 3333
interface ft2232
jtag_speed 0
ft2232_vid_pid 0x1457 0x5118
ft2232_layout "jtagkey"
reset_config trst_and_srst
jtag_device 4 0x1 0xf 0xe
daemon_startup attach
target arm920t little reset_run 0 arm920t
working_area 0 0x200000 0x4000 backup
run_and_halt_time 0 5000
</pre>

For later versions of OpenOCD you may need to specify the device description. For the v2 Debug board add this line to your openocd.cfg:
<pre>
ft2232_device_desc "Debug Board for Neo1973 A"
</pre>

If you are using the libftdi version on Linux, and if you see this iProduct string in your lsusb output "Debug Board for Neo1973", please add this line instead.
<pre>
ft2232_device_desc "Debug Board for Neo1973"
</pre>

For some versions of the v3 Debug board the vid_pid need to be 0x0403 0x6010.  However, commenting out (with #) the ft2232_ lines altogether makes openocd autodetect the Debug board correctly.

=== Using OpenOCD telnet interface ===

The telnet interface can be accessed using
 telnet localhost 4444

it provides a plethora of functions for debugging. You might be interested in

reset halt
resume
poll
reg
load_binary

=== Using OpenOCD and gdb for remote debugging ===

First, you will need a suitable cross-gdb (a gdb that runs on your host architecture, e.g. i386, but works with code for arm).  In OpenEmbedded, you can build such a cross-gdb by using
 bitbake  gdb-cross

If you want to debug the kernel, you can then start this gdb with
 $ arm-linux-gdb vmlinux

which will give you something like
<pre>
GNU gdb 6.6
Copyright (C) 2006 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
GDB is free software, covered by the GNU General Public License, and you are
welcome to change it and/or distribute copies of it under certain conditions.
Type "show copying" to see the conditions.
There is absolutely no warranty for GDB.  Type "show warranty" for details.
This GDB was configured as "--host=i686-linux --target=arm-linux"...
(gdb) 
</pre>

We now need to connect to the OpenOCD daemon, which is done using the '''target remote''' command.  In this particular example, we did already halt the target by issuing '''halt''' on the '''telnet''' command line

<pre>
(gdb) target remote localhost:3333
Remote debugging using localhost:3333
warning: shared library handler failed to enable breakpoint
0xc0129b8c in memmove () at include/asm/current.h:9
9       {
(gdb)
</pre>

For breakpoints to work, you have to enable software breakpoints in OpenOCD, by issuing
 > arm7_9 sw_bkpts enable

on the '''telnet''' command line, and use '''hbreak''' to set breakpoints in gdb.
