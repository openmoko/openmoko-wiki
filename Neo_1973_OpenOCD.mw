== About OpenOCD ==

[http://openocd.berlios.de/ OpenOCD] is a 100% free software On-chip-debugger for commonly-found ARM JTAG probes such as [[wiggler]], chamaeleon, jtag-key and others.

It provides a human-readable telnet interface for manually halting/resuming the target device, reading/writing registers and memory, etc.

In addition, it provides a RDI (remote debugger interface) on a TCP port.  This interface can be used by gdb (the GNU Debugger).

The GTA01 development team uses OpenOCD with a [[wiggler]] compatible probe as their ICE solution.


== Getting OpenOCD ==

=== Debian Package ===

We now have a Debian binary package of OpenOCD, available from http://people.openmoko.org/laforge/dpkg. Installing this package is the preferred method to install OpenOCD on your development machine like

 dpkg --install openocd_82-1_i386.deb

=== Source Code ===

OpenOCD Revision 82 and later have been proven to work with our [[QT2410]] and [[Neo1973]] target board and wiggler as well as Amontect JTAGkey and JTAGkey tiny.  You can e.g. check rev. 130 out of the OpenOCD subversion via

 svn co -r 130 http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/openocd/trunk

== Configuration ==

[[User:HaraldWelte]] has provided a [http://people.gta01.hmw-consulting.de/laforge/misc/openocd.cfg openocd.cfg configuration file] for use of OpenOCD with wiggler and the QT2410 target board. 

== Known Bugs ==

* CP15 register read/write of ARM920T core not working

This has been reported upstream. Bugfix pending.

== OpenOCD and [[Debug Board v2]]

If you wan to use OpenOCD with our Debug Board v2, and want to use the serial port simultaneously with OpenOCD, you '''need libftdi-0.8 or later'''.  Chances are high that your distribution still ships an earlier version of libftdi, so you might want to download it from http://www.intra2net.com/de/produkte/opensource/ftdi/ and build yourself.
