'''pppd''' is used in various scenarios to create a network connection according to the PPP standard between two systems over serial connections. Several configuration files can be put in /etc/ppp/peers, passwords in /etc/ppp/chap-secrets and /etc/ppp/pap-secrets, and "inet ppp" definitions in the  file /etc/network/interfaces.

== GPRS ==

''See [[manually using GPRS]].''

The main scenario on Openmoko is the cellar [[GPRS]] connection for internet access.

== Bluetooth DUN ==

''See [[manually using Bluetooth]].''

Another feature that requires PPP is accessing an Openmoko device over [[Bluetooth]] within the DUN ("dial-up networking") profile.

== Remote pppd ==

The GSM modem of an Openmoko device can be made available for a computer connected via [[USB]] or [[Bluetooth]], using a serial device, SSH, or a TCP port. In this case, pppd run on the computer can establish a GPRS connection.

== QEMU ==

''See [[QEMU#Simple network connection with pppd]].''

If instead of a real Openmoko device QEMU is used to emulate one, it can be networked with the host computer via an emulated serial port.

== VPN ==

Secure VPN (virtual private network) connections can be established using pppd over SSH or PPTP.
