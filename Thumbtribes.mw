== A D-Bus daemon to calculate distance of users ==

In short, thumbtribes is a low-bandwith distance calculation daemon. A typical use case would be to obtain the distance of a specific user and trigger a alert on the phone when they are within a certain distance. The daemon has been designed to continually run and attempts to minimize the amount of traffic by using encoding techniques based on ASN.1 Packed Encoding Rules.
