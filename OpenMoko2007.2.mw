As of 2007-07-26 the development of the next version of the OpenMoko distribution has begun. 

Goals of the new version are an improved set of PIM applications, improved theming that fixes a lot of the usability problems of the 1st generation design, more formalized UI guidelines and a number of changes in the build system. The latter should introduce more recent software by staying closer in sync with upstream org.openembedded.dev.

An official announcement is expected soon.

(Initially this was named OM-2008 in SVN but renamed shortly after that.)
