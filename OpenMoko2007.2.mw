As of 2007-07-26 the development of the next version of the OpenMoko distribution has begun. 

Goals of the new version are an improved set of PIM applications, improved theming that fixes a lot of the usability problems of the 1st generation design, more formalized UI guidelines and a number of changes in the build system. The latter should introduce more recent software by staying closer in sync with upstream org.openembedded.dev.

An official announcement is expected soon.

(Initially this was named OM-2008 in SVN but renamed shortly after that.)

== How to build ==
''Please note that this is no official guide on how to build OM-2007.2 . I am just making my first steps getting this to compile and think it would be a waste of time of I keep problems I found for my own.''

Follow the [http://www.openembedded.org/wiki/GettingStarted getting started] steps of OpenEmbedded. Use Bitbake from the ''stable'' branch from SVN (not the latest 1.8.6 release).

Put the following in your local.conf

 BBFILES = "${HOME}/oe/org.openembedded.dev/packages/*/*.bb"

 MACHINE = "fic-gta01"
 DISTRO = "openmoko"

The new stuff is the definition of BBFILES. Without that it won't work at all.

Run ''bitbake <package name>'' (e.g. openmoko-devel-image).

Flashing an image to the device is not handled by this guide. Hopefully the MokoMakeFile is soon upgraded to be used for OM-2007.2. Since OpenMoko is not using the overlay any more that makefile should be simpler then. :)
