As of 2007-07-26 the development of the next version of the OpenMoko distribution has begun. 

Goals of the new version are an improved set of PIM applications, improved theming that fixes a lot of the usability problems of the 1st generation design, more formalized UI guidelines and a number of changes in the build system. The latter should introduce more recent software by staying closer in sync with upstream org.openembedded.dev.

An official announcement is expected soon.

(Initially this was named OM-2008 in SVN but renamed shortly after that.)

== How to build ==
'''Please note that this is no official guide on how to build OM-2007.2. I am just making my first steps getting this to compile and think it would be a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software waste of time] of I keep problems I found for my own. Additionally it would be good if the new distro gets more exposure and testing so less things will break after the official announcement.'''

Follow the [http://www.openembedded.org/wiki/GettingStarted getting started] steps of OpenEmbedded. Use Bitbake 1.8.6 not a SVN version from the stable branch (otherwise you will get problems with checking out repositories) and the ''org.openembedded.dev'' branch of OE.

Put the following in your local.conf

 BBFILES = "${HOME}/oe/org.openembedded.dev/packages/*/*.bb"
 
 MACHINE = "fic-gta01"
 DISTRO = "openmoko"
 
 ENABLE_BINARY_LOCALE_GENERATION = "1"
 GLIBC_GENERATE_LOCALES = "en_GB.UTF-8"

Replace "${HOME}/oe" with the path to where your "org.openembeded.dev" folder lives. For the other entries have a look at ''conf/local.conf.sample'' about their meaning.

Run ''bitbake <package name>'' (e.g. openmoko-devel-image).

Hopefully the MokoMakeFile is soon upgraded to be used for OM-2007.2. Since OpenMoko is not using the overlay any more that makefile should be simpler then. :-)

=== Build issues ===

==== Wrong certificate ====
You may get something like this while the bitbake recipes are parsed:

 Error validating server certificate for 'https://libw100.svn.sf.net:443':
  - The certificate hostname does not match.
  Certificate information:
   - Hostname: *.svn.sourceforge.net
   - Valid: from Fri, 27 Oct 2006 12:05:58 GMT until Sun, 28 Oct 2007 13:05:58 GMT
   - Issuer: Equifax Secure Certificate Authority, Equifax, US
   - Fingerprint: f2:6c:fe:bb:82:92:30:09:72:dd:1c:b3:e7:56:69:c7:7a:df:67:3e

That is an issue in a bitbake file. One should not use the short-name for sourceforge (sf.net) when certificates are only for exact host names. Accept the certificate and everything is fine for now.

==== openmoko-libs FTBFS ====
Some applications have not been fully modified to build with the new libraries of OpenMoko and still need the old-style ''openmoko-libs'' package. ''libmokogsm'' which is needed for ''openmoko-libs'' then fails to build. As a workaround you can remove the not yet ported applications that need ''openmoko-libs'' making it unneccessary itself. To do this edit ''packages/tasks/openmoko-taks.bb'' and find the following lines:

 .
 .
 .
  openmoko-terminal \
  matchbox-panel-2 \
  matchbox-panel-2-applets \
  matchbox-applet-inputmanager \
 #  openmoko-appmanager \
  matchbox-keyboard \
  matchbox-stroke \
  openmoko-keyboard \
 .
 .
 .

Now put a hash (''#'') before ''openmoko-terminal'' and ''openmoko-keyboard''. You can verify that ''openmoko-libs'' is not needed any more by issuing ''bitbake -g openmoko-devel-image'' (= creates a dependency graph). There should be no mentioning of ''openmoko-libs'' in the file ''task-depends.dot''. '''Please note that the graphicall terminal and the virtual keyboard will be missing now.''' You can still have terminal access by following the [[USB Networking]] guide. For keyboard input in Qemu add the ''-usbdevice keyboard'' switch.


==== gtk+ fails building w/ gtkcombobox.c ====

If you get these errors:

 gtkcombobox.c: In function 'gtk_combo_box_size_request':
 gtkcombobox.c:1859: warning: unused variable 'font_desc'

Go to your /build/tmp/work/fic-gta01-angstrom-linux-gnueabi/gtk+-2.10.14-r3/gtk+-2.10.14/gtk directory, and patch gtkcombobox.c with the following:

=== Flashing with MokoMakefile ===
Since MokoMakefile has not been adjusted to use the new build layout you cannot use it. As a quick hack to make flashing local built image possible again try this:

Find the following lines in the MokoMakefile:

 flash-qemu-local: stamps/qemu stamps/openmoko-devel-image
       ( cd build/qemu && openmoko/flash.sh ../tmp/deploy/images )

And replace them with:

 flash-qemu-local: stamps/qemu
        ( cd build/qemu && openmoko/flash.sh <MY_NEW_BUILD_DIR>/tmp/deploy/glibc/images/fic-gta01 )

Where you should replace <MY_NEW_BUILD_DIR> with the full path to your build directory (the one where ''conf/local.conf'' lives in). Running the image should work, too. :-)

With this changes kernel and uboot image are picked up correctly. However the name of the root filesystem image has changed in OM-2007.2 and the current scripts will not pick it up any more. Just edit ''$OM_DIR/build/qemu/openmoko/env'' and change the line saying:

 rootfs_wildcard="openmoko-*.rootfs.jffs2"

to

 rootfs_wildcard="OpenMoko-*.rootfs.jffs2"

Now it will work correctly again.

== How to build using nslu2-linux MasterMakefile (Ubuntu 7.04) ==
[disclaimer]

'''Check that your /bin/sh (ls -l /bin/sh) is not linked to dash rather than bash.''' Using dash will cause you pain. This is true for a standard install of Ubuntu 7.04 (at least when installing from Live CD). If your /bin/sh points to /bin/dash, correct it with (as root):
 ln -sf /bin/bash /bin/sh

Note: on  http://www.openembedded.org/wiki/OEandYourDistro are better instructions for Ubuntu to make sh be bash.

Create your $OMDIR directory (note that you can change ~/OM-2007.2 to any directory you like): 
 mkdir ~/OM-2007.2 ; cd  ~/OM-2007.2

Grab the nslu2-linux [http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/Development/MasterMakefile MasterMakefile]:
 wget http://www.nslu2-linux.org/Makefile

This will make sure you'll have all the required packages:
 sudo apt-get install \
                autoconf automake automake1.9 \
                bison \
                ccache cogito \
                cvs \
                diffstat \
                docbook \
                flex \
                gcc g++ gawk gcj gettext git-core \
                help2man \
                libc6-dev libglib2.0-dev libtool libxext-dev\
                m4 make \
                patch pkg-config \
                python python-dev python2.4 python2.4-dev python-psyco \
                sed \
                sharutils \
                texinfo texi2html \
                unzip \
                subversion \
                sysutils \
                texinfo \
                bzip2

Ubuntu 7.04 comes with monotone 0.31. You could just go with that and do a mtn db migrate but this takes hours so the easier way would be to download a suitable mtn db from http://www.openembedded.org/snapshots/ and use this.
 mkdir -p monotone
 wget http://www.openembedded.org/snapshots/\
 OE-this-is-for-mtn-<your mtn version>.mtn.bz2 -O monotone/nslu2-linux.mtn.bz2
 bunzip2 monotone/nslu2-linux.mtn.bz2

Go build ;)
 make openmoko-image


* If you an encounter an error with monotone similar to the following: 

  mtn: misuse: database monotone/nslu2-linux.mtn is laid out according to an old schema

Then you need to upgrade nslu2-linux.mtn Use the following command:

  # mtn --db monotone/nslu2-linux.mtn db migrate
