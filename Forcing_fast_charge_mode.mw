This page is intended to consolidate the information about forcing fast charge mode on the Neo.

By default, the Neo will only draw 100 mA of power from a USB connection.  If the Neo recognizes the connection as a smart USB connection (by communicating with the host about power availability) or as a standard Neo charger (by recognizing an expected resistance across two of the connectors) then it will switch into 'fast charge mode', drawing 500 mA.

This switch is important, since the Neo almost always draws more than 100 mA to operate (I believe even while it's turned off, since the GSM stays powered up by default), so the battery will actually go dead while the Neo is charging!

There are several ways of forcing fast charge mode:

* From a terminal or ssh session, execute 'echo -n "fast_cccv" > /sys/devices/platform/s3c2410-i2c/i2c-adapter/i2c-0/0-0008/chgmode'
* Add the following menu entry:
