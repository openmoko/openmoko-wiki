'''Project Title''': Medical Surveillance and Image Tracking Robot<br>
'''Project team members''': 陳威廷,黃國軒,羅棋惠<br>
'''Contact email''': watin23@yahoo.com.tw<br>
'''University''': Dept. of EE, I-Shou University (義守大學電機系)<br>
'''Short description''':<br>
The robot transmits videos to the video server using Bluetooth. The image server can store the image and relay the video to Neo FreeRunner via WiFi, so doctors can monitor the patient in real-time or view previous condition of the patient using the recorded video on the video server.<br>
NEO FreeRunner can control the robot via Wifi in order to see the patient from different aspect.<br>
We also add GPS on the robot. The GPS information are also transmitted to Neo FreeRunner in order to know the position of the robot.<br>
By using these high-technologies, doctors can not only monitor patients remotely but also can take care of more patients than before.<br>
