==Distributions==

* '''[http://activationrecord.net/radekp/qtmoko/ QtMoko V3]''' - QT moko is a Debian distribution for the Openmoko FreeRunner phone. Phone and user interface are based on QT Extended, formerly known as Qtopia. Version V3 should be stable as a daily phone. Latest changes include:
** upgrade to QT 4.5.2 which should improve speed
** merge from other QtMoko branches with many bug fixes
** added nice new QtMaze game
** fixed problem so that apt-get should work out of the box now

* '''[http://activationrecord.net/radekp/qtmoko/download/ Experimental QtMoko X4]''' - new QtMoko images that are based on Debian and that now support running X application from Qtopia. You have to use QX launcher which will allow you to start X applications in fullscreen. You can exit the application when you press the touchscreen for 5 seconds. The application will then be paused and you can either kill it or continue. The support for switching tasks between Qtopia and X application is still missing.
** images are called x4 (because of X windows support), images without X will be called v4
** logging should now work
** better UI speed
** rotation should work
** apt-get should work out of the box
** new application QX which is used as launcher for X applications

After logging in and setting a password, <telnetd> is getting replaced through <sshd> (port 22).
