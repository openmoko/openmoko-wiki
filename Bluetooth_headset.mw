This is mostly based on [[Neo 1973 audio subsystem]] and [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/openmoko-kernel/2009-February/009019.html this thread on the kernel mailing list].

== Preparing ==

=== Get the bluetooth alsa state and DAC setup script ===
Download [http://www.robsims.com/GSMBLUETOOTH.txt GSMBLUETOOTH.txt] and [http://handheldshell.com/bluetooth_pcm bluetooth_pcm]

=== Edit /etc/bluetooth/audio.conf ===

 # Configuration file for the audio service
 
 # This section contains options which are not specific to any
 # particular interface
 [General]
 
 # If we want to disable support for specific services
 # Defaults to supporting all implemented services
 #Disable=Control,Source
 
 # SCO routing. Either PCM or HCI (in which case audio is routed to/from ALSA)
 # Defaults to HCI
 SCORouting=PCM
 
 # Headset interface specific options (i.e. options which affect how the audio
 # service interacts with remote headset devices)
 [Headset]
 
 # Set to true to only support HSP
 # Defaults to false
 DisableHFP=false
 
 # Just an example of potential config options for the other interfaces
 #[A2DP]
 #SourceCount=2

The important part is the SCORouting.

== Connect and setup the headset ==

 export DEVICE=xx:xx:xx:xx:xx

 /etc/init.d/bluetooth stop
 /etc/init.d/bluetooth start
 
 passkey-agent --default 0000 &
 
 dbus-send --system --type=method_call --print-reply --dest=org.bluez \
  /org/bluez/hci0 org.bluez.Adapter.CreateBonding string:$DEVICE
 
 dbus-send --system --type=method_call --print-reply --dest=org.bluez \
  /org/bluez/audio org.bluez.audio.Manager.CreateHeadset string:$DEVICE
 
 dbus-send --system --type=method_call --print-reply --dest=org.bluez \
  "/org/bluez/audio/device0" org.bluez.audio.Headset.Connect
 
 dbus-send --system --type=method_call --print-reply --dest=org.bluez \
  "/org/bluez/audio/device0" org.bluez.audio.Headset.Play

== During the call ==
After having answered / placed the call, switch the audio to the bluetooth headset. You need a small workaround to get audio in, which is included below.

 alsactl -f GSMBLUETOOTH.txt restore
 ./bluetooth_pcm &

the workaround is to switch '''Capture Left Mixer''' first to '''Analogue Mix Right''' and then back to '''Analogue Mix Right'''. This can be done with alsamixer:

 alsamixer

(lookup '''Capture Left Mixer''' in the "gui" and toggle the value).
