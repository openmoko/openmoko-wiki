QEMU può essere utilizzato in tre diversi modi per eseguire [[OpenMoko/it|OpenMoko]]. A seconda del motivo per cui stai per usare l'emulatore, dovresti scegliere la soluzione più adatta.

*''PC'' - OpenMoko può essere compilato per essere eseguito su una normale macchina i386, a 32 o a 64 bit e probabilmente questa è la via più veloce per eseguire OpenMoko se vuoi una anteprima su come appare e funziona. In questo caso QEMU verrà utilizzato unicamente per isolare l'installazione [[OpenMoko/it|OpenMoko]] dal resto del sistema, o, se non stai usando un sistema UNIX, QEMU fornirà un modo non intrusivo e veloce per ottenere una macchina Linux. Altre informazioni possono essere trovate in [[FAQ/it|FAQ]], [[Getting OpenMoko working on host with Xoo/it|qui]] e [[Getting OpenMoko working on host with Xephyr/it|qui]].

*''Integrator/CP'' - Questa è la macchina ARM-based di default che QEMU utilizza. Questo metodo va utilizzato con MACHINE="qemuarm" ed è sufficiente per eseguire l'immagine rootfs originale di OpenMoko, nessun componente hardware tra [[:Category:Neo1973 Hardware/it | Neo1973 Hardware]] verrà emulato, ad eccezione della CPU. Altre informazioni in [[FAQ#Q:_Is_there_an_emulator_available_for_OpenMoko.3F/it|FAQ]].

*''Neo1973'' - Nei repositories OpenMoko è disponibile una versione di QEMU in grado di emulare la maggior parte dell'hardware [[Neo1973/it|Neo1973]] ma non tutto per ora. Quando il progetto sarà più maturo verrà integrato nel ramo di sviluppo principale di QEMU.

== Emulazione Neo1973 ==

Questo metodo permette (ovviamente) di eseguire l'immagine rootfs originale di OpenMoko, dovrebbe essere anche in grado di eseguire l'u-boot originale e le immagini del kernel, le stesse che usa un Neo1973 reale. Altra differenza rispetto al metodo Integrator/CP, è che in questo modo possiamo ottenere una risoluzione corretta dello schermo, alcune (false) letture della batteria e altre cose simili. Attualmente, le parti mancanti all'emulatore sono: [[Hardware:AGPS|AGPS]] e [[Bluetooth/it|Bluetooth]] - il lavoro su questa parti procede. Anche con queste parti mancanti, QEMU dovrebbe fornire un aiuto sostanziale agli sviluppatori nel debugging del kernel e di u-boot.

QEMU '''*non*''' può essere utilizzato, e probabilmente nemmeno altri emulatori possono, per misurare le prestazioni generali di OpenMoko. L'esecuzione del codice in QEMU avviene alla massima velocità che il computer host è in grado di fornire, con un overhead dovuto alla necessità di tradurre il codice. Questo overhead non è uniforme per tutte le differenti istruzioni, quindi se il tuo Neo virtuale riporta circa 100 BogoMIPS (che è la velocità di un Neo reale), azioni differenti eseguite dall'emulatore potrebbero essere portate a termine a velocità diverse. Nella maggior parte dei casi, il Neo virtuale eseguirà più velocemente rispetto ad uno reale (le operazioni legate all'audio potrebbero essere un'eccezione).

! colspan="3"|S3C2410A Processor
|-
|ARM920T core || Works || Already in mainline QEMU.
|-
|Basic guts || Work || This includes GPIO interface, DMA, Interrupt Controller, Timers, NAND controller, MMC/SD host, [[I2C]] and IIS interfaces, Memory & Clock & Power management controllers, RAM.
|-
|Serial ports || Works || Use the "-serial" switch (maybe be specified multiple times) to tell QEMU where serial input/output should go to. GSM module will be connected on UART0.
|-
|RTC || Works || On start QEMU will load it with current time/date - the Neo1973 [[kernel]] doesn't use it for time/date source currently.
|-
|SPI || Works || The guest kernel can drive it using either the SPI interface or raw GPIO bitbanging.
|-
|LCD || Works || The virtual LCD will display as in QEMU window iff "-nographic" is not specified.
|-
|ADC || Works || Mouse events in QEMU window generate what would be touchscreen events on a Neo1973 and are passed to the guest OS through the on-chip ADC.
|-
|OHCI USB || Works || This part is in mainline QEMU. Use the "-usb" switch to enable the controller and "usb_add" in QEMU monitor to attach new virtual or physical USB devices.
|-
|Slave USB || Works || Linux's dummy HCD in conjunction with gadget filesystem API is used to make the virtual Neo appear as a real one connected to the host computer. See [[#Setting up USB connection|Setting up USB connection]] below. (Experimental)
|-
|Watchdog || Works || This is one of the less important on-chip peripherals in S3C2410. It is however used by Linux for rebooting the board.

|[[WM8753L]] || Works || The CODEC is also connect to the CPU's IIS port. Basic [[Neo1973 Audio Subsystem|audio functionality]] is supported - see QEMU documentation on getting audio input/output from the emulator. Volume control has no effects.
|- style="background-color:#eeeedd;"
! colspan="3"|Other peripherals
|-
|NAND Flash || Works || However, some pieces are not confirmed to be completely compatible with the real hardware because of lack thereof. Use "-mtdblock flashimagefilenamehere" switch to point QEMU to your flash image. The file should be at least 69206016 bytes big.
|-
|JBT6K74-AS(PI) || Works || (Aka LCM) Wired to the SPI channel 1
|-
|Buttons || Work || Enter is the AUX button, Space is the POWER button. Wired to on-chip GPIO and PCF50606.
|-
|SD card || Works || This part is already in mainline QEMU. Use the "-sd cardimagegoeshere" switch to point QEMU to the card image. The regular QEMU monitor commands for removable media can also be used. The card works, however the on-chip host controller gave block length errors on heavy I/O despite working as described in specification. I suspect the kernel driver. DMA operation is not tested.
|-
|Bluetooth
|style="background-color:#ffffcc;"|Works
|A generic Bluetooth HCI (just like the BlueCore4 chip) is connected to internal USB hub (just like the Delta DBFM dongle). Currently qemu emulates no other bluetooth devices, so the dongle behaves as if there was no BT-enabled slaves around, being the only device on the piconet, i.e. is not really useful. Likely a Bluetooth keyboard will be emulated. A physical Bluetooth dongle can also be attached to the emulator (see USB documentation in QEMU).
|-
|[[GSM]] || Works || A fake modem is connected to UART0 understanding a (currently quite limited) subset of AT commands. Ultimately it should support as much functionality as possible (basic AT command set, fake GPRS connections, dialing and SMS send/receive). This way all parts of the phone subsystem (CALYPSO, TWL3014, TRF6151) will not have to be emulated. There is a possibility to wire a real GSM modem to QEMU's serial port.
|-
|[[Hardware:AGPS|AGPS]]
|style="background-color:#ffcccc;"|To Do
|There are obvious difficulties emulating the chip, but hopefully it can be made to present the guest OS with some fixed coordinates later when more is known about the chip. Again a real chip could be connected to QEMU's serial port.
|}

Current development is aiming for [[:Category:Neo1973_Hardware#GTA01Bv4 | GTA01Bv4]] compatibility; [[:Category:Neo1973_Hardware#GTA01Bv3 | earlier revisions]] can also be emulated if needed. The differences between the hardware revisions currently only manifest themselves in GPIO wiring. Hardware emulation is implemented in a clean-room manner using official specifications where possible.

== How to get it running ==

=== Using MokoMakefile ===

This is arguably the easiest way of building qemu-neo1973 since you won't need to deal with the compiling and flashing processes yourself. See [[MokoMakefile#QEMU|MokoMakefile]] for details.  (Please note that building all of MokoMakefile takes hours to days while the instructions below take on average 15 minutes to complete).

=== Manual setup ===

To obtain the latest source code for the emulator, you will want to do something like the following:
<pre>
$ svn checkout https://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/src/host/qemu-neo1973
$ cd qemu-neo1973
</pre>
Now, we're going to configure and build the emulator (Note [[#Requirements|Requirements]] below):
<pre>
$ ./configure --target-list=arm-softmmu  # GCC 3.x will be required, see --cc=
$ make
</pre>
See other available options for the configure script by appending "--help".
Now you should have a working emulator under the name "arm-softmmu/qemu-system-arm". To run OpenMoko you will also need to somehow install OpenMoko on your virtual phone, which is totally clean of any software at this moment. There are several block devices to choose from, the best option is probably to do exactly what the Neo1973 manufacturer does before it ships the device to the final user. This process is described in [[Bootloader]], [[Kernel]], [[NAND bad blocks]] and [[Devirginator]] but you don't need to know all the details. Two scripts are provided to generate a firmware for your phone, as realistic as possible. First run
<pre>$ openmoko/download.sh</pre>
which will look up the list of latest available OpenMoko snapshot builds from buildhost.openmoko.org and choose the most recent [[u-boot]], Kernel, and root filesystem images, and download the images (unless they are already found in the openmoko/ directory). These binaries will be used by the next command:
<pre>$ openmoko/flash.sh</pre>
which runs the emulator, loads u-boot into it and then uses u-boot's capability to program the Flash memory to install all the necessary parts of the system into the virtual Flash. It will also set up all the bootloading process including a boot menu (ENTER is [AUX] and SPACE is [POWER]), splash, u-boot environment and some default kernel parameters. If everything goes OK, the script should print a command which you can use to start using the emulator.

QEMU has '''*tons*''' of commandline switches and things that can be configured. You can look them up in [http://www.qemu.org/user-doc.html QEMU user docs]. You will probably want to use the "-snapshot" switch, among other ones. Saving and restoring emulation state at any point (unrelated to "-snapshot") should work as per QEMU user docs too.

=== Pre-built binaries ===

Win32 binaries shipped with firmware can be downloaded from [http://mdk.linux.org.tw/~jserv/openmoko/openmoko-emulator-win32-bin-20070625.zip openmoko-emulator-win32-bin-20070625.zip]. Tested on MS Windows XP and Vista Business.

== Requirements ==

This QEMU tree has only been tested on GNU/Linux. To get graphical (not counting VNC) and/or audio output from the emulator you will need either SDL or Cocoa installed on your computer. To enable audio, see the available switches to the ./configure script.

The scripts that sit in openmoko/ require lynx, wget, python and most GNU base utilities installed in standard locations. If you are using the flash.sh script, you will need to install the netpbm package to get the png conversion tools.

All of the build-time and run-time requirements listed in [http://www.qemu.org/user-doc.html QEMU documentation] apply. This includes zlib, etc. On distributions that use binary packages, remember that you need the packages ending in '''-dev''' or '''-devel'''.

== QEMU and GNU debugger ==

QEMU lets you debug operating system kernels and bootloaders like you debug all other programs. To do this you will need a debugger that speaks the GDB remote debugging protocol - [http://sourceware.org/gdb/ GDB] is the obvious choice. Some cross toolchains come with GDB already set up. Otherwise building cross-GDB yourself is quick and easy (compared to building binutils and cross-gcc).

To debug u-boot, load the file "u-boot" into gdb (not "u-boot.bin") that is produced by "make" when building u-boot. To debug a Linux kernel, load the file "vmlinux" from the main source directory into gdb. These files are in ELF format and contain all the symbol information and are not stripped of debugging data until you run "strip" on them, unlike "u-boot.bin" and "Image"/"zImage"/"uImage". Next, tell QEMU to enable the gdbserver by appending the "-s" switch or issuing "gdbserver" in the monitor. Use the command <pre>(gdb) target remote localhost:1234</pre> to make a connection to the emulator. From there you should be able to use all the usual GDB commands, including stepping instructions, setting breakpoints, watchpoints, inspecting stack, variables, registers and more. If gdb is running in the same directory from which it grabbed the ELF executable, the "edit" command should work so you can jump right to the source line which is executing.

== Setting up USB connection ==

It is possible (although not very straight forward, probably about the complexity of tun-tap networking) to connect the virtual, emulated Neo1973 to the Linux PC on which the emulator is running, and work with it as if a real Neo1973 was plugged into the computer's USB port, but no twiddling with cables is needed. If you're testing your applications on the Neo, it may be worth setting up this kind of connection because it lets you enable normal [[USB_Networking|networking between the PC and the phone and ssh into it]] (which is much more comfortable than typing commands into the OpenMoko's terminal emulator via on-screen keyboard). Here's what you will need in order to get this working:

A Linux host with a 2.6 series kernel. The following drivers compiled-in or in modules: dummy_hcd, gadgetfs, usbnet, cdc_ether. Note that you need root access to perform most actions described here. Here's how to enable them in menuconfig.

Find and enable '''Device Drivers''' -> '''USB support''' -> '''USB Gadget Support''' -> '''Support for USB Gadgets'''

Find '''Device Drivers''' -> '''USB support''' -> '''USB Gadget Support''' -> '''USB Peripheral Controller''' and set it to '''Dummy HCD (DEVELOPMENT)'''

Find and enable '''Device Drivers''' -> '''USB support''' -> '''USB Gadget Support''' -> '''Gadget Filesystem (EXPERIMENTAL)''' (this one is good to have as a module)

Find and enable '''Device Drivers''' -> '''USB support''' -> '''USB Network Adapters''' -> '''Multi-purpose USB Networking Framework'''

Find and enable '''Device Drivers''' -> '''USB support''' -> '''USB Network Adapters''' -> '''CDC Ethernet support (smart devices such as cable modems)'''

These last two drivers are the same [[Getting Started with your Neo1973#By using Ethernet emulation over a USB cable|drivers that you need to work with a real Neo over USB network]]. After you've built the drivers, make sure that the copy of kernel headers in /usr/include/linux is up to date. In particular the file /usr/include/linux/usb_gadgetfs.h needs to be present and if your distribution came with headers older than 2.6.18 or so, then you need tell the package manager to update them, or you can do that manually with
<pre> # cp -a /usr/src/linux/include/linux/* /usr/include/linux/</pre>
(assuming that your kernel sources are in /usr/src/linux). It is important that this is done before building qemu because the build system checks if these headers are functional and in case they aren't found it will disable the USB Slave functionality.

After building qemu and before running it, make sure that the modules are loaded into the kernel. I found it useful to load gadgetfs with the following command:
<pre> # modprobe gadgetfs default_uid=1000  # assuming my User ID is 1000</pre>
and added the following line to my /etc/fstab:
<pre>gadget         /dev/gadget    gadgetfs   noauto,user,group         0   0</pre>
Make sure that the mountpoint /dev/gadget exists:
<pre> # mkdir -p /dev/gadget</pre>
After that the rest of the procedure can be performed from your regular user account. Mounting gadgetfs is done with:
<pre> $ mount /dev/gadget</pre>
The "default_uid" parameter changes the ownership on all files under /dev/gadget to your own and since the files there are created and destroyed dynamically, there's no easy way to have that performed by ''udev''. Now running qemu as you usually do but appending "-usb -usbgadget" should enable the USB Slave functionality. The qemu monitor commands "info usbslave" and "usb_add gadget" will be useful. The former instruction asks the OS running under the emulator (OpenMoko) to describe its slave features (that's what ''lsusb'' does after a Neo1973 is connected to a PC). You can see the available USB configurations in this command's output. Since gadgetfs allows only one configuration, we will need to choose the desired configuration - most device have only one such configuration, in which case you can use just "usb_add gadget" to connect to host; CDC ethernet devices however usually include a second configuration for RNDIS networking (i.e. Ms Windows compatibility) and so does OpenMoko when using the g_ether driver. Hence, to get this right, wait for OpenMoko to fully boot up and execute the following in QEMU monitor:
<pre>
QEMU 0.9.0 monitor - type 'help' for more information
(qemu) info usbslave 
USB2.2 device 1457:5122:

Product: RNDIS/Ethernet Gadget
Configuration 0: RNDIS
Configuration 1: CDC Ethernet
(qemu) 
(qemu) usb_add gadget:1
</pre>
The "1" in "usb_add gadget:N" is the number of the USB configuration that we want to use. If everything went correctly - you can check that in dmesg - you should now have a new network interface called ''usb0'' on the PC, through which you can talk to the OpenMoko running in QEMU:
<pre>
