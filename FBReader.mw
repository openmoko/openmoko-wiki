[http://www.fbreader.org/ FBReader] is a e-book reader program. It can work with txt, fb2, html and other various formats formats ([http://www.fbreader.org/about.php more details]).

== FBReader on [[debian]] with XFCE ==

Using debian installation is quite simple:

 # apt-get install fbreader

After that it will be appeared in XFCE menu (if you use XFCE, of cource).

== Simple hack to fit on screen ==

Launching program cause to fit the window more, than screen. So, it will be some useless to read books. It is proceed because packing layout of toolbar, that too long. To fix this problem, we can disable some of unnecessary buttons on it. First, copy old configuration of your toolbar, then edit:

 # cp /usr/share/FBReader/default/toolbar.xml /usr/share/FBReader/default/toolbar.xml.orig
 # vi /usr/share/FBReader/default/toolbar.xml

My suggestion to edit this file like this:

 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 <toolbar>
        <button id="showLibrary"/>
        <button id="addBook"/>
        <separator/>
        <button id="toc"/>
        <separator/>
        <button id="search"/>
        <button id="findPrevious"/>
        <button id="findNext"/>
        <separator/>
        <button id="preferences"/>
        <button id="rotate"/>
 </toolbar>

After that, FBReader will fit on screen.
