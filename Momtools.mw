=== The Idea ===
I want to create an easy-to-use application, allowing the freerunner (gta-02) to connect to wifi and gprs, and add some useful applications such as a slim media-player and a little accelerometers-game..<br>
(momtools = MyOpenMoko tools)
<br>
=== Used Languages ===
* Java
* Python
=== What it looks like ===
Right now, the application looks something like this..

As you can see on the screenshot, there will be several applications you can choose if you are running momtools.[[Image:momtools.png|right|frameless|200px|The Application-overview]]<br> Basically those will be:
* A simple File Reader (TXT-Files)
* A small accelerometers - game 
* A simple media player
* A gps-tracking tool
* A Wifi-setup-tool
* A gprs-setup-tool

<br><br>
The wifi-connection-tool will be held as simple as possible.

If you know setting up wifi on an IPhone, you know what I want for my openmoko..<br>
Turn on the antenna,
* scan for ap's
* select ap
* enter password
* connect
~ the rest should be done by the phone itself.<br>
<br>Yes, wifi is already working, but I don't like manual editing of wpa_supplicant etc.etc.<br>

=== Timetable ===
The project just started, a first release will be available end Feb. 09.<br>
-> the source-code is closed till this date,(I don't like putting out my not-working code..) afterwards everybody can help speeding up my code =)<br>
