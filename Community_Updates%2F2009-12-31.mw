==Distributions==

{{DistributionBox|
Name=QtMoko [15+16]|
Description=QtMoko is stable distribution that combines Debian/Qtopia using QT 4.6 on 
framebuffer as toolkit. It has also compatibility layer for running X applications. This is mainly bug fixing release. I hope SMS receiving is now OK thanks to old patch from Mike Westerhof. Modem multiplexing can be now enabled. The kernel is latest andy-tracking and has FIFO fix from Thomas White which could give some more performance. Fso-keyring should give no more warnings when working with apt-get. 
Changes from version 14:
* Using QT 4.6 (with 2 patches that should be upstream in QT 4.6.1)
* Better QVGA support (no flickering for QMplayer videos now)
* Reading contacts from SIM in unicode (Ant)
* Wlan - fixed WPA-PSK with AES (Torfinn Ingolfsen)
* Fixed RTC problems after apt-get upgrade
* 10MB smaller image size - no python preinstalled now
* Added icon for sharing GPRS connection with PC
* Disabled modem multiplexing - fixes problems with hang in dialer after boot
* For me GPRS is now more stable (with no multiplexing).
* Powering up modem from code
* Fixed alsa scenario for voip
* Enabled voip and google talk
* New applications
* Hopefully SMS receiving is fixed (mwester)
* Multiplexing can be enabled in configuration file
* Glamo SD card clocking workaround

{{DistributionBox|
Name=Hackable:1|
Description=Hackable:1 is a community distribution for  hackable devices like the Neo Freerunner. It is based on Debian and implements the GNOME mobile platform. After rev5rc1, spent hours and hours debugging this or improving that to finally get the rev5 out. Here are the changes since rev4:
* Most of the software stack now runs under the 'hackable1' user, for security purposes.
* SMS proper implementation
* The contact list bug has been found and fixed!
* Power management improvements, suspend works, bluetooth and wifi are no longer turned on by default.
* An application called 'h1settings' can be used to configure phone features, as well as time and date.
* We created a new theme to celebrate this new release!
* We got a splashscreen! It features a Chuck figure to reflects the rev5 codename.
* For those who used to love the games on OM2007.2, we put them back!
* Boot time seems to have been improved a bit.
* This rev5 release has entirely been built from the automatic build system.
* CDBS is now used for some packages.
* Git repositories can now be used as sources for remote projects.
* A Linux kernel is now packaged in hackable:1, in order not to rely on fso-pkg anymore.
**Debugging has been disabled (boot time improvement)
**Easier kernel upgrade when using an ext2 partition to store the kernel on ÂµSD cards
**Separation of kernel modules in three sets: essential (comes with the kernel), common modules and "more modules"
**You can read a bit onhttp://zecrazytux.net/Embedded/Hackable1/Custom_Kernel.html|

Most important and change making mails on the mailing lists, blogs etc.. Coolest hacks, screenshots, themes etc..
* Michael Trimarchi has compiled '''frequency scaling''' and '''FCSE''' (Fast Context Switch Extension) from [http://lists.arm.linux.org.uk/lurker/message/20091001.203525.e1d1afd4.en.html ARM mailing list] into android-kernel. That is a great news, as it greatly improves performance with Android! For all interested, there is nice [http://lwn.net/images/conf/rtlws11/papers/proc/p01.pdf white paper]. Not so fresh, but gives nice overview on how FCSE works on some ARMv5 architecture. Michael also mentioned that he tries to merge DRM and GLAMO mesa support soon.

*Werner Almesberger, one of most active gta02-core project contributors, wrote up a '''[http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/gta02-core/2009-December/000797.html component situation update]'''. These components are needed for making gta02-core project devices. In a short summary we should have many components, but some of them might be missing.
