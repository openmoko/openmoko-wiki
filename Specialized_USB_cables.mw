== Attaching the Neo (acting as a USB host) to a USB device ==

The USB port (5 position mini type B jack) on the Neo 1973 and Neo FreeRunner can be both a USB device or a USB host. The provided cable (5 position mini type B plug to type A plug) is used when attaching the Neo to a USB host.

A specialized cable is required when attaching the Neo to a USB device. (The device has a USB type A jack).

=== How to make a mini type B plug to a type A jack cable ===

(picture, as soon as I build it)

Parts list:

* Mini type B plug: Digi-Key [[http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?Detail?name=H2958-ND H2958-ND]]
* type A jack: I have not yet been able to find a source for these. Meanwhile, use the jack from a standard USB extension cord
* Cable: Ideally, the data lines should be twisted and 28 AWG, the power lines should be 20 or 28 AWG, e.g. Hitachi Cable [[http://www.hcm.hitachi.com/electronic_round_cable/bulk-usb-cable.shtml 49248 ]]

=== How to make a type A jack to a type A jack adapter (gender changer) ===

This community provided instruction shows how to build an adapter from a USB socket salvaged from a computer motherboard.

Note that these instructions are provided in the hope that they are useful but without any warranty!

[[Image:2-usb-receptables.jpg|thumb|none]]

:#Find an old motherboard with a set of two USB receptacles as shown above.
:#Desolder this set of receptacles from the motherboard. This can be bit tricky but it is doable at least with a desoldering gun.  Solder braid (available at electronic parts stores including Radio Shack) works better than even a professional desoldering gun and is a lot cheaper.
:#Each receptacle has four pins. Use a multimeter to verify that you have no short circuits between the pins or the shield.
:#Solder adjacent pins together (GND to GND, D- to D-, D+ to D+, VCC to VCC).
:#(Optional) Build a test cable. Cut an USB cable with A plug into half, connect it a receptacle and again measure that you have no short circuits. Then connect the test cable to PC and verify that you see
*black GND
*green 0V
*white 0V
*red +5V
:#FreeRunner is shipped with a mini-B-to-A-plug cable. Connect this to a receptacle.
:#(Optional)Connect test cable to the other receptacle and verify that you see
*black GND
*green 0V
*white 0V
*red 0V
when freerunner acts as a device and
*black GND
*green 0V
*white 0V
*red +5V
when it acts as a host.
:#At your own risk, switch freerunner to USB host mode and connect an USB device to the other receptacle of the adapter. Here's how the setup should look like:

=== How to make a type A jack to a type A jack adapter (gender changer) without soldering ===

:#Find a 2-port USB front-panel with a 9-pin connector. Usually you can get one from a PC motherboard package box.
:#Align it in a way so you see the connector pins as a 2 row 5 column matrix with one pin missing.
:#Use 4 staples to short the pins residing in a same column.
:#FreeRunner is shipped with a mini-B-to-A-plug cable. Use it to connect the first port of your panel with your FreeRunner.
:#At your own risk, switch freerunner to USB host mode and connect an USB device to the other receptacle of the adapter.

If you have a ASUS USB/MIR front panel, it is even easier - you can use jumpers to short the pins.

=== Compatibility ===

The adapter works with kingston data traveller 4G memory stick and aiptec pencam webcam. However, for some reason (probably the missing 15k resistors at D+ and D-) it did not work with any of the tested USB keyboards or mice:
<pre>
usb 1-2: new full speed USB device using s3c2410-ohci and address 24
usb 1-2: device descriptor read/64, error -62
usb 1-2: device descriptor read/64, error -62
usb 1-2: new full speed USB device using s3c2410-ohci and address 25

usb 1-2: new full speed USB device using s3c2410-ohci and address 27
usb 1-2: device not accepting address 27, error -62
</pre>
However, if I connect neo to small (unpowered) USB hub
<pre>
usb 1-2: new full speed USB device using s3c2410-ohci and address 61
usb 1-2: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
hub 1-2:1.0: USB hub found
hub 1-2:1.0: 4 ports detected
</pre>
and connect the keyboard to the hub then it is correctly recognized:
<pre>
usb 1-2.3: new low speed USB device using s3c2410-ohci and address 62
usb 1-2.3: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
input:   USB Keyboard as /devices/platform/s3c2410-ohci/usb1/1-2/1-2.3/1-2.3:1.0/input/input13
input: USB HID v1.10 Keyboard [  USB Keyboard] on usb-s3c24xx-2.3
input:   USB Keyboard as /devices/platform/s3c2410-ohci/usb1/1-2/1-2.3/1-2.3:1.1/input/input14
input: USB HID v1.10 Device [  USB Keyboard] on usb-s3c24xx-2.3
</pre>
With the hub I can also use both keyboard and usb memory stick at the same time.

==== Power consumption ====

When I unplug the USB hub (with only keyboard connected to it) the power consumption estimate at /sys/devices/platform/bq2700-battery.0/power_supply/bat/current_now decreases from 175000 to 145000 (are these microamperes?).

== Buy a USB Y cable for powering USB devices and charging the Freerunner while in host mode ==

You do not need to make a cable, you can just buy a "USB 2.0 Dual Power Cable, 2 x Type A to mini B" from [http://www.lindy.co.uk/1m-usb-2-dual-power-cable-2-x-type-a-50cm-apart-to-mini-b/31782.html lindy]. You then plug (via an adapter) the central plug of the Y cable into the upstream port (B socket or A plug) of your powered USB hub, the other A plug of the Y cable into one of the A sockets of your hub, and the mini-B plug of the Y cable into your Freerunner. Put your Freerunner into USB unpowered host mode. It will charge and you can plug a keyboard, a mouse, a disk, cable modem, etc, into the hub.

Adapters, [http://www.rueducommerce.fr/Accessoires-Consommables/Cables-USB/Adaptateurs-convertisseurs/-/MO-35F4EM2168156-Adaptateur-Usb-type-A-Femelle-type-B-Male.htm A female to B male] or [http://www.rueducommerce.fr/Accessoires-Consommables/Cables-USB/Adaptateurs-convertisseurs/-/MO-B7A48M2167837-Changeur-Usb-type-A-Femelle-Femelle.htm A female to A female], are easy to find on the net. You will need a "A female to B male" if your hub has a type B socket or a "A female to A female" if your hub has a type A plug.

This cable might be necessary for a number of reasons, e.g.

* The application requires that the Neo not become suspended
* The application requires long run time
* The attached USB device consumes a lot of power

(However, as there is a wide range[http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.handhelds.openmoko.hardware/415]
of USB hubs out there, one might find power (on a powered USB hub)
is available already on the hub's mini USB 5 pin socket already, so not need a specialized cable after all!
Check with a test meter.)

These instructions will show you how to make a cable with 3 ends:

* A mini-USB type B cable for the Neo itself
* A cable of whatever type to go to your USB device.
* A cable going to a +5V +/-10%(max!) power supply with enough power for your device and to charge the Neo. This could be a wall charger or even another USB plug.

You connect the Data+ and Data- wires of the Neo and the device, and connect all of the ground wires together and all of the +5V wires together. This powers the Neo and the device, while letting the neo talk to the device.
You have to connect 2 pcs  15k ohm resistors, one from D+ to ground, and one from D- to ground, to comply with USB-spec for hostmode, as Neo is switching off the internal resistors when you enable charging/powering over USB by asserting EN_USBHOST.
See schematics, LOCATION:49XX

Just for reference, the USB wires from left to right are:
*Black: Power -
*Green: Data -
*White: Data +
*Red: Power +

The Mini_USB-B connector has a fifth pin, the ID-pin.
This pin is supposed to be short to ground to signal FreeRunner to enter hostmode. For the Y-cable and enabling external power while in hostmode, you may connect a 47k ohm resistor from ID-pin to ground. This is the same trick the OM-wallcharger uses to signal to FreeRunner it can charge with 1A. Future kernels should switch to hostmode + external power when seeing this 47k resistor.

===Parts===
USB 2.0 Plug type A to mini 5 pin USB Plug type B that should include the ID signal, so that you can add the 47k ohm resistor to ID-pin to trigger fast charging
