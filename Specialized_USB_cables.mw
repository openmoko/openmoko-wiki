=== Modified USB cable to inject power while in host mode ===

Three-headed cables are required if you want to power the FreeRunner / USB device whilst in host mode.  For many uses the FreeRunner provides sufficient power to make such a cable unnecessary. At the moment, you'll have to manufacture this one yourself. You need to make a cable with three ends:

* A mini-USB type B cable for the Neo itself
* A cable of whatever type to go to your USB device.
* A cable going to a +5V +/-10%(max!) power supply with enough power for your device and to charge the Neo. This could be a wall charger or even another USB plug.

You connect the Data+ and Data- wires of the Neo and the device, and connect all of the ground wires together and all of the +5V wires together. This powers the Neo and the device, while letting the neo talk to the device.
You have to connect 2pcs  15kOhm resistors, one from D+ to ground, and one from D- to ground, to comply with USB-spec for hostmode, as Neo is switching off the internal resistors when you enable charging/powering over USB by asserting EN_USBHOST.
See schematics, LOCATION:49XX

Just for reference, the USB wires from left to right are:
*Black: Power -
*Green: Data -
*White: Data +
*Red: Power +

The Mini_USB-B connector has a fifth pin, the ID-pin.
This pin is supposed to be short to ground to signal Freerunner to enter hostmode. For the Y-cable and enabling external power while in hostmode, you may connect a 47kOhm resistor from ID-pin to ground. This is the same trick the OM-wallcharger uses to signal to Freerunner it can charge with 1A. Future kernels should switch to hostmode + external power when seeing this 47k resistor.

:#Find an old motherboard with a set of two USB receptacles as shown above.
:#Desolder this set of receptacles from the motherboard. This can be bit tricky but it is doable at least with a desoldering gun.
:#Each receptacle has four pins. Use a multimeter to verify that you have no short circuits between the pins or the shield.
:#Solder adjacent pins together (GND to GND, D- to D-, D+ to D+, VCC to VCC).
:#(Optional) Build a test cable. Cut an USB cable with A plug into half, connect it a receptacle and again measure that you have no short circuits. Then connect the test cable to PC and verify that you see
 black GND
 green 0V
 white 0V
 red +5V
:#Freerunner is shipped with a mini-B-to-A-plug cable. Connect this to a receptacle.
:#(Optional)Connect test cable to the other receptacle and verify that you see
 black GND
 green 0V
 white 0V
 red 0V
when freerunner acts as a device and
 black GND
 green 0V
 white 0V
 red +5V
when it acts as a host.
:#At your own risk, switch freerunner to USB host mode and connect an USB device to the other receptacle of the adapter. Here's how the setup should look like:

=== Compatibility ===

The adapter works with kingston data traveller 4G memory stick and aiptec pencam webcam. However, for some reason (probably the missing 15k resistors at D+ and D-) it did not work with any of the tested USB keyboards or mice:
 usb 1-2: new full speed USB device using s3c2410-ohci and address 24
 usb 1-2: device descriptor read/64, error -62
 usb 1-2: device descriptor read/64, error -62
 usb 1-2: new full speed USB device using s3c2410-ohci and address 25
 usb 1-2: device descriptor read/64, error -62
 usb 1-2: device descriptor read/64, error -62
 usb 1-2: new full speed USB device using s3c2410-ohci and address 26
 usb 1-2: device not accepting address 26, error -62
 usb 1-2: new full speed USB device using s3c2410-ohci and address 27
 usb 1-2: device not accepting address 27, error -62

However, if I connect neo to small (unpowered) USB hub
 usb 1-2: new full speed USB device using s3c2410-ohci and address 61
 usb 1-2: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
 hub 1-2:1.0: USB hub found
 hub 1-2:1.0: 4 ports detected
and connect the keyboard to the hub then it is correctly recognized:
 usb 1-2.3: new low speed USB device using s3c2410-ohci and address 62
 usb 1-2.3: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
 input:   USB Keyboard as /devices/platform/s3c2410-ohci/usb1/1-2/1-2.3/1-2.3:1.0/input/input13
 input: USB HID v1.10 Keyboard [  USB Keyboard] on usb-s3c24xx-2.3
 input:   USB Keyboard as /devices/platform/s3c2410-ohci/usb1/1-2/1-2.3/1-2.3:1.1/input/input14
 input: USB HID v1.10 Device [  USB Keyboard] on usb-s3c24xx-2.3

With the hub I can also use both keyboard and usb memory stick at the same time.

=== Power consumption ===

When I unplug the USB hub (with only keyboard connected to it) the power consumption estimate at /sys/devices/platform/bq2700-battery.0/power_supply/bat/current_now decreases from 175000 to 145000 (are these microamperes?).
