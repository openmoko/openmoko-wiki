Note that the Neo 1973 can not currently run the OM 2008.8 software (the latest release).<strike>, and that there are no immediate plans to make that happen.  Users should instead purchase a Freerunner if they wish to participate in the Openmoko community.</strike> On Aug. 14, 2008, Marek provided an update:

Currently we are working on a major infrastructure change (debian style 
package management) which will enable us to port Om 2008.8 to GTA01. Once 
this shift to the new style has been completed we wont have the perfect GTA01 
support yet but we are moving towards that direction. You can support that by 
helping us later on.

We have enough GTA01 lovers within Openmoko itself, so that it wont be 
forgotten.   :-)
