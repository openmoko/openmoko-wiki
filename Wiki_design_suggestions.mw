This is brain storming on how to improve the look and feel of the OpenMoko wiki. Some of this may be subjective; different people have different tastes. Ideally however, if we can change the design in a way that we all find aesthetically pleasing to a greater degree, then perhaps we have both made the world a little more pleasant to see, and also improved the brand capital of OpenMoko.

==Suggestions==
* Increase the default font size in edit boxes.
* Make the font size just a hair bigger on the sidebar - less than any more than a bit
* perhaps increase the bottom margins of the boxes on the left by just a hair...
** or maybe try removing the boxes, or just having a vertical line on the right...
