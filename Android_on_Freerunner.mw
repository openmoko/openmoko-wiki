= Introduction = 
This page is dedicated to the installation of Android on the [[Neo 1973]] and [[Neo FreeRunner]] handsets.

You can find general informations (porting/development and day to day usage) about Android and Neo phones here : [[Android]]

== Android on internal flash ==

=== Images ===

There are currently a few prebuild images:

[http://panicking.kicks-ass.org/download/ Michael Trimarchi's images with latest fixes]
[http://people.openmoko.org/sean_mcneil/ Sean McNeil images]

To use the Kernel you have to either :

* adjust your [[Uboot]] environment to support a Kernel of more then 2 MB 
* change to the [[Qi]] Bootloader. It supports 2MB kernels out of the box.

I have placed an older 2.6.26 kernel with Android support at:

    [http://people.openmoko.org/sean_mcneil/uImage-android uImage-android]

I have put up a jffs2 image that replaces rootfs on the Freerunner at:

=== Installation on internal flash ===

As noted above, this installation requires you to wipe out the existing kernel and rootfs in NAND on your Freerunner. You also must have an SDCARD and it needs to be configured with two (2) primary partitions: First is VFAT/MSDOS (16 or 32) which acts as the /sdcard storage area for pictures, movies, music, etc. and the Second is an ext3 primary partition for use of internal Android /data area to store settings, caches, etc.

The first thing I suggest is to setup an SDCARD. You can flash the NAND first, but you must have an SDCARD with two partitions as stated before you'll be able to boot. I use a 2GB card which I have split in half. fdisk shows me:

    /dev/mmcblk0p1               1        2454      996310    6  FAT16<br>
    /dev/mmcblk0p2            2455        4908      996324   83  Linux

formatted as

    sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/mmcblk0p1<br>
    sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/mmcblk0p2

There is no need to populate the ext3 partition at all. The VFAT partition can be populated with media content if you so desire.

With your SDCARD all set, you are ready to flash the kernel and rootfs:

    sudo {path_to}/dfu-util -d 0x1d50:0x5119 -a kernel -D uImage-android<br>
    sudo {path_to}/dfu-util -d 0x1d50:0x5119 -a rootfs -D androidfs.jffs2<br>



== Android on SDcard ==

=== Images ===

There are currently a few prebuild images:
[http://activationrecord.net/radekp/openmoko/android/ Radek Polak's SD card images] (install on ext3, first partition on SD must be FAT16)

=== Using jffs2 images ===

You can also boot from the SD Card using the pre built images like so :-
* Mount the image using [http://wiki.openmoko.org/images/8/82/Mntjffs.sh this] script like so 
   sudo ./Mntjffs.sh freerunner-v5.jffs2 image/
* Then copy (cp -R) the files in directory image/ to any of the first three partitions on the SD Card (if using Qi) eg cp -R /your-path/image/* /media/android/
* cd /media/android.
* wget http://activationrecord.net/radekp/openmoko/android/init.rc .
* mkdir boot
* copy the kernel here and name it uImage-GTA02.bin


Some notes about booting android from sdcard : 

=== Setup ===

* Build android from source. See [http://trac.koolu.org/ koolu website] for directions.
* Use the first script in [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2008-December/036982.html this mail] (adapt to your filesystem) to stage your android install.
* copy the contents of this directory on a ext3 partition on your sdcard.
* add a /boot directory on your sdcard.
* copy the uImage-android kernel (see above) and copy it inside your /boot with the exact name '''uImage-GTA02.bin'''
* I changed the init.rc (in your root on the sd) to remove mounts that could be problematic (/data for example) :

* Install [[Qi]] on you NAND flash. You can still boot whatever distro you've got on internal flash using the NOR bootloader. You should try the magic file in /boot to show kernel messages.
* boot the GTA02, and pray.


== Status ==

Most of the hardware on Freerunner seems to work on latest Android images, but not always perfectly.

If you want to see details of what is already usable, please have a look at: [[Android_usage]]


== Android Debug Bridge ==
To assist in debugging and to gain shell access to the phone with Android, you can use the instructions found here: [[Android debug bridge]]
