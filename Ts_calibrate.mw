'''''ts_calibrate''''' is a graphical tool to calibrate the touch sensor.  The app asks the user to tap a sequence of 5 cross-hairs with a stylus.  It recalibrates the touchscreen, then exits.

As of August 2007, it is typically included in the Openmoko root filesystem, but does not appear  in the graphical menus.  You can run it from an [[ssh]] or [[GTKTerm2]] command line.

It is a C program, ts_calibrate.c, and appears to be part of the [[xcalibrate]] package.

==Upstream==

:''I am not sure where the upstream sources of this come from.  Could someone add that please? It appears to be also distributed by OpenEmbedded, Familiar and GPE.  --[[User:Dcorking|Dcorking]] 18:37, 20 August 2007 (CEST)

==Usage notes==

Use TSLIB_TSDEVICE=/dev/input/event1 environment variable to choose right device.

You probably won't get good results with a finger or fingernail - so try to have a stylus handy.
