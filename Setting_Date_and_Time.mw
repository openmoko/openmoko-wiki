Linux systems (such as the Freerunner) prefer that the system clock be set to universal time (UTC). Then, you will need to configure the timezone to display the time adjusted to local time.

See [[Timezone]] for instructions on changing the time zone.

For more information on Linux timekeeping, see [http://www.linuxsa.org.au/tips/time.html Linux, Clocks, and Time]. (But ignore mentions of ''/etc/sysconfig/clock''. That doesn't apply to the Openmoko environment.)

== Setting the date/time using "date" ==

To change the date on your Freerunner, issue one of the following commands:

 date -s ''MMDDhhmm''
 date -s ''MMDDhhmmYYYY''
 date -s ''MMDDhhmmYYYY.ss''

where ''MM'' is the month, 01-12; ''DD'' is the day, 01-31; ''hhmm'' is the time, 0000-2359; ''YYYY'' is the optional year, and ''.ss'' is the optional seconds.

== Setting date/time from your linux box ==

  ssh root@openmoko "date -s `date --utc +%m%d%H%M%Y.%S`"

== Setting the date/time automatically with NTP ==

If your Freerunner is connected to the internet, you can instead set the time automatically:

  opkg install ntpclient
  ntpclient -s -h pool.ntp.org

== Syncing the hardware clock ==

No matter which method you used above, sync the hardware clock with the system time to make your change persist over reboots:

 hwclock --systohc

== Local Time ==

If you want to have localtime setup, then link your proper zone file to /etc/localtime, similar to the following:

 ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York /etc/localtime

And restart the xserver so that your clock shows the right time:

 /etc/init.d/xserver-nodm restart

== Future Work ==

Presumably it might also be possible to use gpspipe (or something else) to set the date once you have a gps fix?  In addition, the phone stack should set the date, time, and timezone once connected to a network.
