See also [[Timezone]] for instructions on changing the time zone.

== Setting the date/time using "date" ==

To change the date on your Freerunner, issue one of the following commands:

 date -s ''MMDDhhmm''
 date -s ''MMDDhhmmYYYY''
 date -s ''MMDDhhmmYYYY.ss''

where ''MM'' is the month, 01-12; ''DD'' is the day, 01-31; ''hhmm'' is the time, 0000-2359; ''YYYY'' is the optional year, and ''.ss'' is the optional seconds.

== Setting the date/time automatically with NTP ==

If your Freerunner is connected to the internet, you can instead set the time automatically:

  opkg install ntpclient
  ntpclient -s -h pool.ntp.org

== Syncing the hardware clock ==

No matter which method you used above, sync the hardware clock with the system time to make your change persist over reboots:

 hwclock --systohc

== Future Work ==

Presumably it might also be possible to use gpspipe (or something else) to set the date once you have a gps fix?  In addition, the phone stack should set the date, time, and timezone once connected to a network.
