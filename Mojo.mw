Mojo is an experimental mail client written in Java SE and SWT. It runs on top of Jalimo.

== Main features ==
* Intended to be finger friendly.
* Supports POP3, IMAP, SMTP.
* Implemented SSL/TLS support.
* Supports reading HTML e-mails by converting it into plain text.
* Attachements.
* Can store e-mails locally.
* User interface designed for quick actions. You can write and send e-mail from the same screen.

== Issues ==
* Some parts are slow at the moment, especially local handling of emails. It all depends on the CacaoVM or JamVM optimalization.
* SSL/TLS currently not working with CacaoVM + GNU Classpath-, it will work with CacaoVM + OpenJDK out of the box.

== Installation ==
There are two tarballs available - for Openmoko and for x86 Desktop Linux. All instructions are in those archives (basically you just have to run the installation script).
* [http://www.stud.fit.vutbr.cz/~xkratk00/mojo/mojo-client-0.9-openmoko.tar/  mojo-client-0.9-openmoko.tar]
* [http://www.stud.fit.vutbr.cz/~xkratk00/mojo/mojo-client-0.9-x86/linux.tar/  mojo-client-0.9-x86/linux.tar]

Next step is an IPK package. But you don't have to worry, the bash script in current installation is user friendly enough ;).

== Source code ==
Because project space on Openmoko Projects have some unresolved issues with my svn account, I currently keep source code on my private svn. As soon as we get svn.openmoko working, I will place all the source code there. Until that you can download tar file with source code and Maven2 structure, including pom.xml.

The code has detailed comments, but they are in CZ. With release on the svn I will place there version with translated comments in EN.

== Feedback ==
You can use the mail list or forums on the project page https://projects.openmoko.org/projects/mojo/.
