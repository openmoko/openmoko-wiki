* '''Sebastian Spaeth has created a new shr-testing image!''' Sebastian expects that upgrades will happen every 3-4 weeks or similar. He will try to upgrade things to a working set of revisions. All testing will be restricted to shr-lite-image for now. Full thread is reachable on '''[http://lists.shr-project.org/pipermail/shr-devel/2009-December/001557.html Shr-Devel]''' mailing list. But remember that there is no way bugs are going to be fixed (or even debugged) if developers don't know about them, so go for it and [http://trac.shr-project.org/trac/wiki/Bug-report report bugs]. Testing branch is supposed to do the following:
** always give you a working phone
** care about opkg upgrade'ability
** Be conservative in the number of cool on-the-edge features it takes

* There is great work going on '''[http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/gta02-core/ gta02-core]''', to redesign FreeRunner into a better device! Looks like a lot of work is already done, but all skilled (and partially skilled ;) ) electronic engineers and software developers are welcome to help. There are many things that need to be done and as Werner Almesberger said, for some of them, it can even be better to be a newbie, because you have fewer preconceptions. Tasks that need to be done includes [http://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/gta02-core/STATUS schematics reviews] or [http://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/gta02-core/docs/ecn/STATUS ECN reviews] but there is also [http://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/gta02-core/docs/kicad-wishlist kicad-wishlist] for C++ developers, thus if you have some spare time do not hesitate and help resolve software issues with KiCAD. For all those, who want to help '''[http://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/gta02-core/docs/REVIEW REVIEW]''' and '''[http://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/gta02-core/docs/GETTING-STARTED GETTING-STARTED]''' is a good place to look for information.

* Mike Crash is working on a new car, bike and outdoor '''[http://www.mikecrash.com/index.php?name=News&file=article&id=115 navigation]''' with vector maps imported from OSM data. There is a lot to do, but Mike expects first public version around turn of year.

* Anton Olkhovik showed interesting project which unleashes gaming abilities of Neo FreeRunner - [[USB_Gamepad_(NeoPlay)]]
