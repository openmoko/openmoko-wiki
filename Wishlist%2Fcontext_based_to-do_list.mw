== Context based to-do list ==

A [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done GTD]]-like list, with reminders based in contexts (such time, position, talk/see/stay near somebody...).


== Use Cases ==

* If I arrives to home and there is some "@home" things in the to-do list, the system reminds me that.

* If I call to Alice, the system reminds me that I want to ask hem about XXX before the phone make the call.

* I want to talk with Peter about YYY, and the system knows that I usually met Peter in the office...
