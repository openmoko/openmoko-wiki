Openmoko uses '''[http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/DBus D-Bus]''', a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware middleware] message bus system which provides a simple way for applications to talk to one another and to be available as services in the system. If the application providing the service is not running when a message is sent, the application will be started.

There are two separate busses:
*a system bus for root which runs whenever the phone is on
*a session bus which is started for the user when X starts

== Session bus services ==

These can at least be defined in /usr/share/dbus-1.0/services/ and /usr/share/dbus-1/services/

* org.freesmartphone.Phone
* org.gnome.evolution.dataserver.AddressBook
* org.gnome.evolution.dataserver.Calendar
* org.gnome.GConf
* ...

== System bus services ==

There is information about these in /etc/dbus-1/system.d/

* org.freedesktop.Avahi
* org.bluez.*
* ...

== Accessing the services ==

=== Command line ===

For simple uses, there's a command mdbus. Try
<pre>
mdbus -s 
</pre>
to explore the DBus environment.

For example, to dial a number (using FSO milestone 3):
<pre>
mdbus -s org.freesmartphone.ogsmd /org/freesmartphone/GSM/Device org.freesmartphone.GSM.Call.Initiate \'12345\' 'voice'
</pre>

=== Python ===

To use D-Bus in [[Python]], the package python-dbus needs to be compiled and installed. Note that since the interfaces change over time you might want to read the source code of zhone from git.freesmartphone.org to get examples of current API.

To dial a number:
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/env python
import dbus
bus = dbus.SystemBus()
gsm_device_obj = bus.get_object("org.freesmartphone.ogsmd", "/org/freesmartphone/GSM/Device")
gsm_call_iface = dbus.Interface(gsm_device_obj,'org.freesmartphone.GSM.Call')
proxy = bus.get_object("org.openmoko.Dialer", "/org/openmoko/Dialer")
gsm_call_iface.Initiate("12345", "voice")
</pre>

To run the program use the following:
<pre>
dbus-launch python my_program.py
</pre>
