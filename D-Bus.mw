[[Openmoko]] uses '''D-Bus''', a message bus system which provides a simple way for applications to talk to one another and to be available as services in the system. If the application providing the service is not running when a message is sent, the application will be started.

There are two separate busses:
*a system bus for root which runs whenever the phone is on
*a session bus which is started for the user when X starts

== Session bus services ==

These can at least be defined in /usr/share/dbus-1.0/services/ and /usr/share/dbus-1/services/

* org.openmoko.Dialer
* org.gnome.evolution.dataserver.AddressBook
* org.gnome.evolution.dataserver.Calendar
* org.gnome.GConf
* ...

== System bus services ==

There is information about these in /etc/dbus-1/system.d/

* org.freedesktop.Avahi
* org.bluez.*
* ...

== Accessing the services ==

=== Command line ===

For simple uses, there's a command dbus-send. 

For example, to dial a number:
 dbus-send --print-reply --dest="org.openmoko.Dialer" /org/openmoko/Dialer org.openmoko.Dialer.Dial string:12345

=== Python ===

To use D-Bus in [[Python]], the package python-dbus needs to be compiled and installed.

To dial a number:
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/env python
import dbus
bus = dbus.SessionBus()
proxy = bus.get_object("org.openmoko.Dialer", "/org/openmoko/Dialer")
interface = dbus.Interface(object, "org.openmoko.Dialer")
interface.Dial("12345")
# or this: proxy.Dial("12345", dbus_interface="org.openmoko.Dialer")
</pre>

The first "org.openmoko.Dialer" is the ''bus name'' of the service on the bus and "/org/openmoko/Dialer" is an ''object path'' in the service. Before calling a method on the object via the ''proxy object'' we still need to specify which ''interface'' the method belongs to: the second (and third) "org.openmoko.Dialer". Finally "Dial" is the method in the interface.
