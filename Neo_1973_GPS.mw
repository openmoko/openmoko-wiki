The Neo1973 device contains an integrated GPS. The particular device
is marketed as an AGPS, and there is some [[Hardware:AGPS |
discussion]] available as to what significance that "A" might have.

Note that the GTA02 device (not yet available) contains a different GPS chip (see http://www.u-blox.com/products/atr0635.html and/or http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/product_card.asp?part_id=3932 for specs).

All purchased phones do not include the GPS binary driver.  [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2007-July/008466.html]

In the very early shipment to 50 Phase 1 developers, a binary-only program for talking to the the GPS was accidentally included 
in /home/root/DM2/gps, (and presumably, the same binary would function on a P0 device).
This binary is called gllin and it is a oabi binary, i.e. it will only work in the 2007.1 OpenMoko environment. There is now a eabi binary, which works with 2007.2, but it does not work very well and has not been released yet (as of end of September). 

There is an ongoing effort to write a Free Software
program that could be used instead of this binary-only program. 

See
[[Hammerhead/Protocol]] for details and the latest status.

Some scripts for those with the binary are on [[GPS_scripts]]

=== Possible GPS programs ===

As people develop more sophisticated GPS applications, please note them here.

Here are some ideas for possibilities:

* Cairo-based mapping
* Routing
* [[Openstreetmap]] a map viewer, annotation, and editing system.
* [[GPS-Trail]] a simple trail logger.
* [[GPS_Navigation#roadmap|roadmap]] mapping system using freely available maps (US census TIGER, DGLib, shapefiles).
* [[Geocaching]] paper chase for advanced users
* Set Profile (Mute, etc.) to coordinates (ex. At work)
* [[qpegps]] qtopia (arm PDA) based map viewer with gps features

* [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2007-July/007252.html collection of ideas]
