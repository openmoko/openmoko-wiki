The [[Neo 1973]] device contains an integrated ''GPS''. The particular device is marketed as Assisted GPS ('AGPS'). Performance requirements are defined in GSM/GPRS 3GPP TS 25.171, CDMA 3GPP2 C.S0036-0. There is some [[Hardware:AGPS | discussion]] available as to what significance that "A" might have.

The external antenna for the GPS is using a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMCX MMCX] connector.  More information about external antennas on the [[GPS antennas for neo1973|GPS antennas page]]. The connector for the internal GPS antenna is also using a MMCX connector. This GPS connector is located on the side of Freerunner.

Note that the [[GTA02 GPS]] device contains the [[u-blox ANTARIS 4 ATR0635]].

A critical problem with early (current) GTA02s are interferences with the SD card, which results in a long connection time (10min+) to get first GPS data. See [[GPS Problems | this page]] for more discussion and suggested fixes.


=== GTA01 GPS driver (gllin) ===
''Main article - [[gllin]]''

The GPS driver is available here: [http://3rdparty.downloads.openmoko.org/gllin/ http://3rdparty.downloads.openmoko.org/gllin/]. It is a command line tool that after starting writes the positioning data so that they can be read as if they were written to the file.

And here the Mail from Michael Shiloh [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2007-November/011916.html http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2007-November/011916.html]

There was an effort to write a Free Software
program that could be used instead of this binary-only program, but this stalled after the decision to change GPS chips in GTA02.
The Iphone 3G also uses the same GPS chip. It's not inconcievable that this might lead to further effort.

See [[Hammerhead/Protocol]] for details and the latest status.

Some scripts for those with the binary are on [[Manually_using_GPS]]

Please see the important information on [[Gllin]]!

=== GTA02 GPS ===
{{Main|GTA02 GPS}}

To turn on the GPS, echo 1 to the file /sys/devices/platform/s3c2440-i2c/i2c-adapter/i2c-0/0-0073/neo1973-pm-gps.0/pwron

To read from the GPS, simply read /dev/ttySAC1.

 gpspipe -r 127.0.0.1 2947

gpspipe is in package gps-utils

{{Note|
 cat /dev/ttySAC1 
Produces the unknown msg*58 this doesn't happen with gpspipe}}
 
Before getting a fix, the GPS spits out lots of "$GPTXT,01,01,01,NMEA unknown msg*58", though these stop once a fix is obtained. 

A position without a fix looks like:
* $GPGGA,235946.99,,,,,00,00,5.0,,M,0.0001999,M,0.0020199,*57
One with a fix:
* $GPGGA,065852.00,5613.022527,N,00306.725890,W,1,05,0.5,158.0,M,0.277000,M,-0.010

If you are having GPS problems with your freerunner, please document these on the page [[GPS Problems]].
[[FreeRunner_GPS_antenna_repair_SOP]] documents a possible solution.

In Openmoko projects, you could find a GPS test program that could provide graphical and text dump of GPS information. See [[Howto Test Your GPS with agpsui]]. This project called [http://svn.projects.openmoko.org/svnroot/openmoko-agpsui Openmoko AGPS UI project].

=== Possible GPS programs ===

As people develop more sophisticated GPS applications, please note them here.

Here are some ideas for possibilities:

* Cairo-based mapping
* Routing
* [[Openstreetmap]] a map viewer, annotation, and editing system.
* [http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Pyroute Pyroute] is a routing program written in Python by Ojw, and a mobile phone GUI for maps, GPS, and routing.
:* [http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Rana Ran&aacute;] is the new version of pyroute
* [[GPS-Trail]] a simple trail logger.
* [[GPS_Navigation#roadmap|roadmap]] mapping system using freely available maps (US census TIGER, DGLib, shapefiles).
* [[Geocaching]] paper chase for advanced users
* Set Profile (Mute, etc.) to coordinates (ex. At work)
* [[qpegps]] qtopia (arm PDA) based map viewer with gps features
* [[Navit]] a car navigation system with routing engine.
* [http://www.tangogps.org TangoGPS] works very well, downloads maps on demand and stores them for later use, very efficient. 
* [[QMapControl]] Qtopia based mapping widget. Displays maps and custom data, also other widgets can be bound to coordinates. GPS parser for the gllin output included.
* [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2007-July/007252.html collection of ideas]
* [http://www.kflog.org/cumulus/ Cumulus] GPS software for glider pilots (and pilots in general), has a port for Qtopia and pulls (world) maps from the KFLog flight planner project. I think someone has put a project like this on the projects website [http://projects.openmoko.org/projects/openvario/ here].
* [http://svn.projects.openmoko.org/svnroot/openmoko-agpsui Openmoko AGPS UI project].
* [[GPS Sight]], a popular Openmoko project under LGPL.
* [[Orrery]], an unpopular Openmoko project for displaying the night sky.
* [http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Gosmore Gosmore] is a routing and viewer of OSM XML data such as the planet.osm.

== Using the Neo's GPS on a Laptop ==

First be sure you have gllin installed on the Neo.

*On host type: '''nc -vvn -l -p 5000 > /tmp/nmeaNP''' (Host starts listening on port 5000 for GPS-signals and sends them to /tmp/nmeaNP)
*On the Neo type:   '''nc 192.168.0.200 5000 < /dev/ttySAC1''' (Signals from device will be send to port 5000 on host.) If your host is connected to the neo via wifi, change the IP address in the command to the one of the host. 
*On the host PC install GPSD, your GPS is attached as /tmp/nmeaNP 
*start gpsd on host with: '''gpsd -p /tmp/nmeaNP'''
*run your application! I used gpsdrive and it works better than my stand-alone GPS. 
*Tested with RoadNav. Works great!

With this in mind if you have an unlimited data package you could export this over the internet. the possibilities are limitless.

== Bluetooth GPS relay ==

To make your neo appear like a regular bluetooth GPS:

=== GTA01 ===
*Power up the bluetooth radio
*Run the gllin script
*run '''sdptool add SP'''
*run '''rfcomm watch 0 1 sh -c "cat /tmp/nmeaNP >/dev/rfcomm0" &'''

=== GTA02 ===
*Power up the bluetooth radio
*Ensure [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Gpsd#GPS_on_GTA02 gpsd] is running and the gps-utils package is installed
*run '''sdptool add SP'''
*run '''rfcomm -r watch 0 1 sh -c "gpspipe -r >/dev/rfcomm0" &'''
