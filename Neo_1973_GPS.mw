The Neo1973 device contains an integrated GPS. The particular device
is marketed as an AGPS, and there is some [[Hardware:AGPS |
discussion]] available as to what significance that "A" might have.

Note that the GTA02 device (not yet available) contains a different GPS chip (see http://www.u-blox.com/products/atr0635.html and/or http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/product_card.asp?part_id=3932 for specs).

All purchased phones do not include the GPS binary driver.  [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2007-July/008466.html]

=== GTA01 GPS driver (gllin) ===
''Main article - [[gllin]]''

The GPS driver is available here: [http://3rdparty.downloads.openmoko.org/gllin/ http://3rdparty.downloads.openmoko.org/gllin/]. It is a command line tool that after starting writes the positioning data so that they can be read as if they were written to the file.

And here the Mail from Michael Shiloh [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2007-November/011916.html http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2007-November/011916.html]


In the very early shipment to 50 Phase 1 developers, a binary-only program for talking to the the GPS was accidentally included 
in /home/root/DM2/gps, (and presumably, the same binary would function on a P0 device).
This binary is called gllin and it is a oabi binary, i.e. it will only work in the 2007.1 OpenMoko environment. There is now a eabi binary, which works with 2007.2. 

There is an ongoing effort to write a Free Software
program that could be used instead of this binary-only program. 

See
[[Hammerhead/Protocol]] for details and the latest status.

Some scripts for those with the binary are on [[Manually_using_GPS]]


=== Possible GPS programs ===

As people develop more sophisticated GPS applications, please note them here.

Here are some ideas for possibilities:

* Cairo-based mapping
* Routing
* [[Openstreetmap]] a map viewer, annotation, and editing system.
* [http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Pyroute Pyroute] is a routing program written in Python by Ojw, and a mobile phone GUI for maps, GPS, and routing.
* [[GPS-Trail]] a simple trail logger.
* [[GPS_Navigation#roadmap|roadmap]] mapping system using freely available maps (US census TIGER, DGLib, shapefiles).
* [[Geocaching]] paper chase for advanced users
* Set Profile (Mute, etc.) to coordinates (ex. At work)
* [[qpegps]] qtopia (arm PDA) based map viewer with gps features
* [[Navit]] a car navigation system with routing engine.
* [[QMapControl]] Qtopia based mapping widget. Displays maps and custom data, also other widgets can be bound to coordinates. GPS parser for the gllin output included.
* [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2007-July/007252.html collection of ideas]

== Using the Neo's GPS on a Laptop ==

*First be sure you have gllin installed on the Neo.
*On host type: '''nc -vvn -l -p 5000 > /tmp/nmeaNP'''
*On the Neo type:   '''nc 192.168.0.200 5000 < /tmp/nmeaNP'''
*
*On the host PC install GPSD, your GPS is attached as /tmp/nmeaNP 
*start gpsd on host with: '''gpsd -p /tmp/nmeaNP'''
*run your application! I used gpsdrive and it works better than my stand-alone GPS. 
*Tested with RoadNav.Works great!
*
*With this in mind if you have an unlimited data package you could export this over the internet.
*the possibilities are limitless.
