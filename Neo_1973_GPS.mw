The Neo1973 device contains an integrated GPS. The particular device
is marketed as an AGPS, and there is some [[Hardware:AGPS |
discussion]] available as to what significance that "A" might have.

All purchased phones do not include the GPS binary driver.  [http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/community/2007-July/008466.html]

In the very early shipment to 50 Phase 1 developers, a binary-only program for talking to the the GPS was accidentally included 
in /home/root/DM2/gps, (and presumably, the same binary would function on a P0 device). 

There is an ongoing effort to write a Free Software
program that could be used instead of this binary-only program. 

See
[[Hammerhead/Protocol]] for details and the latest status.

Some scripts for those with the binary are on [[GPS_scripts]]

=== Possible GPS programs ===

As people develop more sophisticated GPS applications, please note them here.

Here are some ideas for possibilities:

* Cairo-based mapping
* Routing
* [[Openstreetmap]]
* [[GPS-Trail]]
