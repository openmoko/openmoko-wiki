==Introduction==
Application and shell launcher, with editable config file, and log result page.

==Config File==

Use "#" char to insert comment line.
Text before "=" char is launcher label, text after "=" char is command to execute.

There aren't any escape character to use "#" and "=" at this moment.

Example:

 # start/stop gpsd
 start gpsd=/etc/init.d/gpsd start
 stop gpsd=/etc/init.d/gpsd stop
 # launch battery
 battery=battery.py

==Exec Buttons==

"NoW" equals "No Wait". Use this button if you want to launch your command in background. You don't catch any result or logs on logbook because shortom doesn't wait the end of the program. If you have to launche graphical program this button is the better choice.

"Run". ShortOm launch the command and wait the end. Every message print in standard output end error will be logged in logbook.

==Installation==

  opkg install http://projects.openmoko.org/frs/download.php/473/shortom_0.2_all.ipk
