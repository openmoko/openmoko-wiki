== General Recommendations ==
[http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/ GNU Standards] is also a good read for developers in
general.

== C Coding ==
All C code should be done in the C99 standard -- it's much more maintainable, less error prone,
clean and concise, and removes a lot of C's warts.

Here is some good information about C99:

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_programming_language#C99

This is a good C coding guide:

== C++ Coding ==
* [http://www.zen.uci.edu/~klefstad/s/C++-style.html C++ Style Guidelines]
