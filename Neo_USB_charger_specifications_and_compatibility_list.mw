{{Languages|USB charger}}

The Neo Freerunner and the Neo1973 can be charged with the supplied USB charger, which is a device that does not comply with the recent  [http://www.usb.org/developers/devclass_docs/batt_charging_1_0.zip USB Battery Charging Specification]. This specification demands for an open circuit on the ID pin and a short circuit between the D+ and D- pins.

Most of the USB chargers around behave the same way than the one supplied with the Openmoko Neo. In fact, up to now no charger has been identified to comply to the specification mentioned above. The differences (incompatibilities) result from the way the USB charger signals the mobile phone that it is present: most of the manufacturers chose to connect a resistor between the "ID" pin and the "GND" pin in the USB connector.

For Openmoko Neo, the value of the resistor is 47.5 kOhms.

Following USB chargers have been identified and measured:
