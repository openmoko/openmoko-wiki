{{Languages|USB charger}}

The Neo Freerunner and the Neo1973 can be charged with the supplied USB charger, which is a device that does not comply with the recent  [http://www.usb.org/developers/devclass_docs/batt_charging_1_0.zip USB Battery Charging Specification]. This specification demands for an open circuit on the ID pin and a short circuit between the D+ and D- pins.

Most of the USB chargers around behave the same way than the one supplied with the Openmoko Neo. In fact, up to now no charger has been identified to comply to the specification mentioned above. The differences (incompatibilities) result from the way the USB charger signals the mobile phone that it is present: most of the manufacturers chose to connect a resistor between the "ID" pin and the "GND" pin in the USB connector.

For Openmoko Neo, the value of the resistor is 47.5 kOhms.

== AKII Technology Charger (supplied with Neo Freerunner) ==

This charger comes with the Neo Freerunner package.

=== Specifications ===

*Model: [http://www.ak2.com.tw/pd_main.asp?sg_id=11 A10P1-05MP]
*Input: 100-240V~ /0.3A
*Output: +5v up to 2.0A
*Signaling: 47.5k 1% resistor between ID pin and ground for openmoko charger identification

=== Compatibility ===

*HTC Polaris (tested on O2 Xda Orbit 2)
*Openmoko Neo1973
*Openmoko Neo Freerunner


== ''sold as'' "Essentiel b (Boulanger)" ''Chargeur allume-cigares/USB'' ==

This car charger is sold at Boulanger but should be available in other stores under different makes. It is an adapter to a USB cable which can then be connected to any USB-charging device. By default, it will be seen as a "passive" USB port at 100 mA.

=== Specifications ===

*Model: Cod. 779220
*Input: DC 12-30 V
*Output: DC 5 V - 850 mA max

=== Compatibility ===

*Openmoko Neo Freerunner, provided the 500 mA charging mode is enabled on the FR, as otherwise it would only (dis)charge, as the FR would only draw 100 mA out of it.


== Garmin 362-00043-04 ==
