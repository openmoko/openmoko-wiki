'''Qalee''' is a desktop environment designed for the Freerunner; it's able to launch program switch between opened ones, close them, start the phone show hide keyboard, etc...

Previously based on [[Debian]], it is now based on [[SHR]] (2009-08-08), but will be back to [[Debian]] when they use the new version of framework.

== Install ==
Qalee is released separately for [[SHR]] and [[Debian]]:
* Debian: [http://openmoko.openmatica.es/QALEE/Qalee-0.0.2-dev.tar.gz v. 0.0.2]
* SHR: [http://openmoko.openmatica.es/QALEE/Qalee-0.0.3-dev.tar.gz v. 0.0.3]
Just copy the content of the tar in the ÂµSD and [[boot from sd card]] in order to use it. Just before starting Qalee will ask you a code (hardcoded): it is <code>1234</code>.
