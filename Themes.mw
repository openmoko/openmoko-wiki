This page is a stub about making Openmoko pretty, waiting for openmono-look.org .

One may already [[Customize Application Icons]], change [[Ringtones]] and customize the windows decoration with [[Edje]].
But there is not much yet by way of ready-to-use themes for changing the look and feel of the phone with `opkg'.

A Tango variant is at http://52grad.de/.stuff/freerunner/ .

The [http://exchange.enlightenment.org/ Enlightenment exchange] repository has themes, modules and applications.

There are a few background images for the [[Display Locker]] screen in Om 2007.2.
