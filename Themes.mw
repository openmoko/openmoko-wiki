This page is a stub about making Openmoko pretty, waiting for openmono-look.org .

One may already [[Customize Application Icons]], change [[Ringtones]] and customize the windows decoration with [[Edje]].
But there is not much yet by way of ready-to-use themes for changing the look and feel of the phone with `opkg'.

== Where to find themes ==

A Tango variant is at http://52grad.de/.stuff/freerunner/ .

The [http://exchange.enlightenment.org/ Enlightenment exchange] repository has themes, modules and applications.

There are a few background images for the [[Display Locker]] screen in Om 2007.2.

== How to customize the boot screens ==

There are three steps: u-boot, kernel and X.

=== Changing the u-boot splash image ===

The u-boot splash image is on its own partition. According to ticket <strike>[http://docs.openmoko.org/trac/ticket/1735 1735]</strike>:
 To replace the splash screen image on the device you need to convert the PNG file to a compressed raw frame buffer content and then flash this into the splash screen partition.
 For the conversion, go to svn.openmoko.org/trunk/src/host/splash/ and run
   ./splashimg.pl boot_image.png | gzip -9 >new_splash.gz
 If your update process runs under Linux (OE package ?) you'd then execute the following commands:
   flash_eraseall /dev/mtd4
   nandwrite -p /dev/mtd4 new_splash.gz
 If you update through DFU, you would:
   dfu-util -a splash -R -D new_splash.gz
 Note the NOR also contains a copy of the splash screen. If you generate a new NOR image with "mknor", just specify the new image with -s boot_image.png, and it will put the "openmoko" text near the bottom of the screen. 

=== Changing the Kernel's boot splash image ===

TBD

=== Changing X's startup ===

TBD
