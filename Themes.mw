This page is a stub about making Openmoko pretty, waiting for openmono-look.org .

Everything is customizable already, but there is not much yet by way of ready-to-use themes for changing everything at once. Eventually, the plan is to offer readymade packages to change the phone's look and feel simply with `opkg' (or the graphical installer).
* For the eyes, one may change the [[Configuring the boot splash screens| boot splash screens]], [[Customize Application Icons]], [[Changing wallpaper]] and customize the windows decoration with [[Edje]]. Here is a guide on [[Hacking the UI|configuring the home screen in ASU]].
* For the ears, we can change [[Ringtones]], [[Boot sound]] and [[Tap sound]].
* By touch, we are not doing much with the vibrators and accels yet.


== Where to find themes elements ==

A Tango variant for Illume based distros is at [http://52grad.de/.stuff/freerunner/].

CarloRatm [http://forum.telefoninux.org/index.php/topic,649.0.html illume theme]. If you do not read Italian try [http://lists.openmoko.org/nabble.html#nabble-tc1377326%7Ca1377326 this thread on the mailing list] first.

A GTK theme following the Tango line is at [http://www.3v1n0.net/openmoko/moko-sun-gtkrc].

The [http://exchange.enlightenment.org/ Enlightenment exchange] repository offers themes, modules and applications.

There are a few background images for the [[Display Locker]] screen in Om 2007.2.
