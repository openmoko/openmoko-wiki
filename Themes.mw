This page is a stub about making Openmoko pretty, waiting for openmono-look.org .

One may change the [[Configuring the boot splash screens| boot splash screens]], [[Customize Application Icons]], change [[Ringtones]] and customize the windows decoration with [[Edje]].
But there is not much yet by way of ready-to-use themes for changing everything at once. Eventually, the plan is to offer readymade packages to change the phone's look and feel simply with `opkg' (or the graphical installer).

== Where to find themes elements ==

A Tango variant for Illume based distros is at [http://52grad.de/.stuff/freerunner/].

A GTK theme following the Tango line is at [http://www.3v1n0.net/openmoko/moko-sun-gtkrc].

The [http://exchange.enlightenment.org/ Enlightenment exchange] repository offers themes, modules and applications.

There are a few background images for the [[Display Locker]] screen in Om 2007.2.
