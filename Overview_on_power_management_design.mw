== Profile of suspend/resume ==
* Estimated suspend current 
System only keeps two power sources, AUTO3v3 and DOWN2 1v8, when it is in suspend. Theoretically, the suspend current should be the sum of the current of all modules which are in sleep/suspend mode connected these two power channels. So we have to know the current consumption of following modules which are in sleep/suspend mode individually.

** Glamo
** BT
** AMP
** WLAN
** SDRAM
** NAND 
** LCM

== GPIO config == 
* gpio config on A5
* gpio config when system get into sleep mode (suspend)
* config of glamo in sleep mode 

== Automated suspend/resume testing ==
Initial idea is to provide an environment to test suspend/resume process and collect the suspending current. 
Basically, we could use multimeter with GPIB to achieve the whole process automatically.
