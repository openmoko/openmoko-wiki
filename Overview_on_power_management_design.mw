== State diagram ==
* Normal Mode
* Sleep Mode 
* Poweroff Mode
* Slow Mode ??

== Profile of suspend/resume == 


== GPIO config == 
* gpio config on A5
* gpio config when system get into sleep mode (suspend)
* config of glamo in sleep mode 

== Automated suspend/resume testing ==
Initial idea is to provide an environment to test suspend/resume process and collect the suspending current. 
Basically, we could use multimeter with GPIB to achieve the whole process automatically.
