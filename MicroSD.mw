'''microSD''' is the format of the removable flash memory cards used in Neo 1973 and Neo Freerunner devices. Additionally the Neo Freerunner support '''microSDHC'''.

For more informations about this format see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroSD microSD on Wikipedia].

A list of supported cards can be found at [[Supported microSD cards]].

Importent note: Wear-leveling is not part of the SD card specification (version 2.0 SDHC), so please check for yourself that the SD(HC)-card use:
*built-in ECC error correction and detection
*Wear Leveling technology

Other importent specifications are:
*Low power consumption

*[[MicroSD]](HC) cards are a sort of a SSD: [http://robert.penz.name/137/no-swap-partition-journaling-filesystem-on-a-ssd/ December 7, 2008, robert.penz.name:  No SWAP Partition, Journaling Filesystems, … on a SSD?] Quote: "...They assume perfect wear leveling...We stay also with the 2 million cycles and assume a 16GB SSD *With 50 MByte/sec we get 20 years! *With 2 MByte/sec we get 519 years! *And even if we reduce the write cycles to 100.000 and write with 2 MByte/sec all the time we’re at 26 years!!...1.  Never choose to use a journaling file system on the SSD partitions: Bullshit, you’re just risking data security. Stay with ext3...7. One more thing to consider is that flash-devices handle their space in blocks. The blocksize typically varies between 16KB and 512 KB. Therefore writing one byte may cause erase and rewrite of up to 512KB..."
